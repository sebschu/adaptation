# Kraljic & Samuel (2008):

Does context-independent (here consistent variation in /s/ production) differ from context-dependent variation (i.e., variation just in production of /s/ within context of /tr/) 

### Exp 1:

Exposure phase (lex decision task) -- phonetic categorization task -- production task (free production + asked to imitate speaker)

#### Results: 
* shift of perceptual boundary in context-independent variation condition; no shift of categorical boundary in context-dependent variation condition

* No dependence on exposure in free production task

* Participants are able to shift their production to the specific speaker if asked to

### Exp 2:

Do participants also spontaneously accommodate their productions?

Round of game "Mad Libs" to get participants to produce certain words with speaker X -- exposure phase (lex decision task, speaker X) -- phonetic categorization task -- another round of mad libs -- production task 

* replication of exp 1 in categorization and production task
* no effect in terms of before/after mad libs task -- participants don't seem to accommodate spontaneously
