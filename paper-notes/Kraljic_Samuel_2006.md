"adaptations in the perceptual system seem to be driven by
acoustic cues, rather than by higher-level information
about a speakerâ€™s identity." => also true for semantic adaptation?


### Question

When do listeners form speaker-specific phonetic representations?

### Exp 1:

Usual Exposure (lex decision) -- phonemic categorization task 

Stimuli: /d/ -/t/ ambiguous sound

Results:  

* no speaker-specific adaptation effect -- seems like phonetic categorization is mostly affected by way the most recent talker speaks

### Exp 2:

Same as Exp 1 but /s/-/sh/ boundary

Results:

* speaker-specific adaptation effect -- independent of order of exposure
