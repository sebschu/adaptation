# Perceptual learning for speech: Is there a return to normal?
Tanya Kraljic and Arthur G. Samuel. 2005. Cognitive Psychology.


## Experiments

### Experiment 1:
Question:	Do listeners change their /s/-/sh/ boundary after being exposed to a speaker who uses a more ambiguous /s/ or /sh/ sound.

#### Procedure:
* __Exposure phase__: lexical decision task with 100 words and 100 non-words
* 40 words critical items:
	* 20 with regular /s/ or /sh/ (depending on condition)
	* 20 with ambiguous mix between /s/ and /sh/ (depending on condition)
* 60 words filler items: don't contain /s/ or /sh/

* 1 male, 1 female speaker (randomized across participants)

* __Unlearning__ (25 min): visual task, no audio, just in 1 condition

* __Test phase__: phoneme classification task

#### Results:
* People exposed to ambiguous /sh/ speaker, classified more variations as /sh/, and vice versa
 * Unlearning did not weaken this effect -- in fact made it numerically (but not stat significantly) stronger

### Experiment 2:
* Experiment 1s Unlearning condition was purely visual, it is conceivable (although extremely unlikely) that participants engaged in some kind of rehearsal between Exposure and Test, causing the perceptual learning effect to be maintained unnaturally.
* Question: Same as above, but with verbal unlearning phase.

#### Procedure
* Same as in Exp 1, except the unlearning phase
* __Unlearning phase__: Participants heard the same or a different voice (depending on condition) provide descriptions of cards. The descriptions contained no /s/ or /sh/ sounds.

#### Results
* Same as in Exp 1, with no effect of whether the voice in the unlearning phase was the same or differed from the voice in the training and test phase


### Experiment 3:
* Same as Exp 2, except unlearning phase
* __Unlearning phase__: The descriptions for the Corrected-phoneme Unlearning task included normal versions of the previously mispronounced phoneme. Specifically, participants who heard odd /s/ in the Exposure phase now heard an average of one good /s/ in each tangrams description during Unlearning (but heard no /sh/); similarly, participants who heard odd /sh/ during Exposure now heard an average of one good /sh/ in each tangrams description (but no /s/).

#### Results:
* When the voice across the exposure and unlearning phase was the same, there was no perceptual learning effect
* When the voices differed, there was still a perceptual learning effect
* Suggests that listeners make speaker-specific updates of perceptual categories and not change their entire system
### Experiment 4:
* Results in experiment 3 could have been frequency effect -- participants always selected the one more which had higher frequency in unlearning task

* __Unlearning phase__: The descriptions for the Mixed-phoneme Unlearning included equal numbers of Corrected /s/ phoneme and Corrected /S/ phoneme descriptions. Specifically, all participants (whether they had heard odd /s/ or odd /S/in the Exposure phase) now heard an average of one good /s/ in half of the tangrams descriptions, and an average of one good /S/ in the other half of the tangrams descriptions.

#### Results:
* In all conditions, there was a perceptual learning effect
* marginal interaction between speaker (same or different) and effect size, suggesting that people are still adapting to the same speaker

### Experiment 5
* Q: Does learning transfer to other speaker?

#### Results:
* female train => male test: yes
* male train => female test: no
	
* potentially because female train items are in between male and female test items, whereas male train items are far away from female test items. (in terms of mean frequency).
