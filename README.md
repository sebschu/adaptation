# Semantic pragmatic adaptation

Repository of experiments and computational models of semantic/pragmatic adaptation.

This repository is structured as follows:

* [Experiments](./experiments): This folder contains the experiment code, data analysis scripts and data from a series of web-based experiments.

* [Models](./models): This folder contains the implementation and configuration files of several probabilistic computational models related to semantic adaptation.

See the README files in the two folders for more details on the individual experiments and models.
