124:44	and, i mean, it was just, it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family, * getting down together and doing that.	probably	###speakerb42.###yes.###speakera43.###i think,###speakerb44.###my mother, * excuse me.###* go ahead.###speakera45.###yeah.###well, my, uh, my, uh,###probably one of the biggest decisions i think that *t*-1 was very strengthening for our family was rather than * have one child make that decision than just * delegate it.###speakerb46.###uh-huh.###speakera47.###i think that they, they had a great deal of, um,###all the brothers and sisters got together###and they actually had a conference.###speakerb48.###that's great.###speakera49.
164:75	unfortunately, a lot of times it, responsibilities like that seem *-1 to fall to, you know, maybe one child in the whole family, you know.	maybe	###speakerb60.###you were very, fortunate.###speakera61.###and they,###speakerb62.###speakera63.###i know.### they, and, well, they had, well, they had, they had seen it coming.###speakerb64.###uh-huh.###speakera65.### so, so,###i mean, it,###i mean, i, i, i, i har-, i, i truly wish that if something like that were *-1 to happen that my children would do something like, that for me.###speakerb66.###uh-huh.###speakera67.###speakerb68.###uh-huh.###absolutely.
214:40	and i think that when she passed away *t*-1 it was probably one of the greatest,	probably	###speakera81.###yeah.###yeah.###well, with my, with my grandmother i think it was, it was such that, uh, that she did not have the problem with,###she was very well aware###and her daughter came and visited her###speakerb82.###uh-huh.###speakera83.###at least her daughter, came and visited her###and also her several grandchildren, came and visited her every day.###speakerb84.###uh-huh.###speakera85.###speakerb86.###uh-huh.###speakera87.###speakerb88.###that's great.###speakera89.
236:81	and, um, i, i, i think that what one thing that they were concerned *t*-1 probably was the fact 0 it wasn't necessarily, you know, like the quantity of care but the quality of, care.	probably	###it was more of a relief for her.###speakerb90.###uh-huh.###speakera91.###speakerb92.###sure.###speakera93.###and, um,###i mean, but she was truly, she was truly aware.###i mean, i, i, i di-, i don't know how i would, how i would deal *t*-1 if one of my parents came with, with alzheimer's. or something like, that which *t*-2 is, which *t*-3 is far more devastating.###speakerb94.###uh-huh.###speakera95.###speakerb96.###that would be tough.###speakera97.###speakerb98.###yes.###absolutely.###speakera99.
257:96	i think, i think, i think, 0 you know for myself i, i see that as probably the, the, what everything would hinge upon *t*-1.	probably	###speakerb100.###uh-huh.###speakera101.###speakerb102.###yes.###speakera103.###that the people that *t*-1 worked there were very were very interested that, *-2 to make it as close *ich*-3 a home environment, as possible.###speakerb104.###right.###speakera105.###speakerb106.###uh-huh.###speakera107.###speakerb108.###uh-huh.###speakera109.###speakerb110.###yes.###it would,###speakera111.
267:30	that's the, that's probably the major question.	probably	###speakerb106.###uh-huh.###speakera107.###speakerb108.###uh-huh.###speakera109.###speakerb110.###yes.###it would,###speakera111.### i think, i think, i think, 0 you know for myself i, i see that as probably the, the, what everything would hinge upon *t*-1.###speakerb112.###oh,###speakera113.###is it,###how close is it *t*-1 to a home environment.###speakerb114.###yes.###that's right.###speakera115.
313:90	i, i, i think that perhaps, perhaps the extended family, you know, that it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care.	maybe	###yes, um.###speakera129.###speakerb130.###uh-huh.###speakera131.###speakerb132.###uh-huh.###speakera133.###speakerb134.###that's right.###speakera135.###speakerb136.###sure.###absolutely.###and, people, things are scattered so much nowadays.###speakera137.###uh. yeah.###speakerb138.###speakera139.###yeah.
352:13	that would, certainly help.	certainly	### and i, and i, i kind of see that, that, you know, perhaps, you know, we may need *-1 to like get close to the family environment and and get down to the values of, you know,###speakerb148.###uh-huh.###speakera149.###i mean, uh, it's,###money seems *-1 to be too big of an issue. with, with, with, with what *t*-2's going on today###speakerb150.###oh, yeah.###speakera151.###speakerb152.###sure.###speakera153.###speakerb154.###realistically it is *?*.###speakera155.###and i, i think, i think that we may not, that may be, you know, perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may, that may choose *-1 to alleviate a lot of the problem.###speakerb156.###uh-huh.###speakera157.###speakerb158.
571:18	today was, uh, definitely a shorts day around here.	definitely	###like right now, today was in about, you know, the fifties.###speakera63.###uh-huh.###speakerb64.###but, um, you know, i, i do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses.###speakera65.###yeah.###i'd like *-1 to be able *-2 to wear those here.###today it's eighty-eight degrees.###speakerb66.###oh, my.###speakera67.###so,###speakerb68.###uh-huh.###speakera69.###needless * to say, my sweaters have been hung *-1 in the closet for quite a while now.###speakerb70.###uh-huh.###speakera71.
885:70	uh, and at the same time i think that i receive on, on the order of, uh, probably, seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way 0 *-2 to just hang up on it *t*-1 *t*-3.	probably	###but in the second time, at least overtly, uh, where someone comes in and, uh, finds out information about you that *t*-1 should be private *t*-2, uh, does not seem, uh, um, obviously, everyday.###speakerb2.### i, i think 0 i agree with that.###i think 0 in a good example on the typical thing that *t*-1 happens, uh, when the phone rang *t*-2 and it's t i 0 *t*-3 calling, my immediate reaction is that it's some sort of strange phone message###and then i realize, oh, no, this is something 0 i solicited *t*-1,###speakera3.###that's right.###speakerb4.###so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion###but after that i realized, no, i, i really wanted this###and it was sort of exciting###and so, that was almost an example of s-, an invasion that *t*-1 turns out *-2 to be not invasive.###speakera5.###uh-huh.###speakerb6.###speakera7.###right,###it turned out *-1 to be, uh, uh, an invitation.###speakerb8.###exactly.
928:72	so there's,, things that *t*-1 invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them *t*-2 and possibly things that *t*-3 invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it,	possibly	###speakerb18.###speakera19.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###speakerb20.### and, and, uh, that, that then ends up *-1 being the, the most common example for me.###speakera21.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###speakerb22.###um, i guess 0 i'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this second, this one that you raised *t*-1.###speakera23.###yeah.###speakerb24.###and i don't think 0 i would have thought about that.###i think 0 that's a good idea on your part.###i don't typically feel intruded on, on the things, uh, the sense of * finding out information.###speakera25.###well, presumably those who *t*-1 find out such information, if they are doing it, i would prefer *-2 to not to be known *-3,###and, i mean, you know, the classic, oh, i don't know c i a conspiracy theories or whatever, would have such parties *-1 trying *-2 to do it without your knowledge.
943:8	then maybe my privacy hasn't been *?* because i have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded *-2.	maybe	###i think 0 that's a good idea on your part.###i don't typically feel intruded on, on the things, uh, the sense of * finding out information.###speakera25.###well, presumably those who *t*-1 find out such information, if they are doing it, i would prefer *-2 to not to be known *-3,###and, i mean, you know, the classic, oh, i don't know c i a conspiracy theories or whatever, would have such parties *-1 trying *-2 to do it without your knowledge.###so there's,, things that *t*-1 invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them *t*-2 and possibly things that *t*-3 invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it,###and i can't talk about the second one other than * to, to, to generate paranoia.###it's a surmise###and, i'd like *-1 to think that it's quite low, at least in this country.###speakerb26.###* to, to surmise. it is there.###speakera27.###i don't think 0 i'd like the k g b is monitoring my phone or anything like that.###speakerb28.###well, i guess, 0 although, i, well, that's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is *t*-1 *t*-3 *t*-2, because, uh, if that's the case of a tree falling in the forest###speakera29.###uh-huh,###yeah.###speakerb30.###and i'm not feeling invaded
967:39	um, the, the other side of that might be 0 if, if someone found out something *rnr*-1 or surmised something *rnr*-1 that *t*-2 weren't true then i would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense.	might	###uh, if you're defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something 0 you don't know *t*-1 about it, well, then i guess 0 one could assume 0 one was invaded *-2###speakera33.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakerb34.###but i don't feel invaded by it.###speakera35.###uh-huh,###speakerb36.###i don't, have a sense of threat *ich*-1 in general from those sorts of things,###speakera37.###uh-huh.###speakerb38.###i'm not sure why.###uh, i guess 0 it comes from a sense of fact or facts###and if someone finds out something about me that *t*-1 is true, i, i don't have a sense of loss from that.###speakera39.###uh-huh.###well, you must have a relatively clean conscience then.###speakerb40.
967:125	um, the, the other side of that might be 0 if, if someone found out something *rnr*-1 or surmised something *rnr*-1 that *t*-2 weren't true then i would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense.	probably	###uh, if you're defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something 0 you don't know *t*-1 about it, well, then i guess 0 one could assume 0 one was invaded *-2###speakera33.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakerb34.###but i don't feel invaded by it.###speakera35.###uh-huh,###speakerb36.###i don't, have a sense of threat *ich*-1 in general from those sorts of things,###speakera37.###uh-huh.###speakerb38.###i'm not sure why.###uh, i guess 0 it comes from a sense of fact or facts###and if someone finds out something about me that *t*-1 is true, i, i don't have a sense of loss from that.###speakera39.###uh-huh.###well, you must have a relatively clean conscience then.###speakerb40.
986:95	that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high *t*-1 because i would find that there be, cou-, a good possibly that their facts were, were fantasy.	possibly	###speakerb40.###um, the, the other side of that might be 0 if, if someone found out something *rnr*-1 or surmised something *rnr*-1 that *t*-2 weren't true then i would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense.###speakera41.###yes,###yes,### ev-, more harmed or something.###speakerb42.###bec-,###right,###because, you don't have anyway 0 *-1 to turn it off *t*-2.###speakera43.###yeah.###speakerb44.###tho-,###did you hear about this lotus data base that *t*-1 was being put *-2 together?###speakera45.###yes,###i did.###i was just about *-1 to write a letter when i heard 0 they canceled it *t*-2.###speakerb46.
992:10	and that might be the sense of the spending pattern *ich*-2, for instance, that, that i would have thought *t*-1 to be private.	might	###speakerb42.###bec-,###right,###because, you don't have anyway 0 *-1 to turn it off *t*-2.###speakera43.###yeah.###speakerb44.###tho-,###did you hear about this lotus data base that *t*-1 was being put *-2 together?###speakera45.###yes,###i did.###i was just about *-1 to write a letter when i heard 0 they canceled it *t*-2.###speakerb46.###that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high *t*-1 because i would find that there be, cou-, a good possibly that their facts were, were fantasy.###speakera47.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakerb48.###and then i would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from a, that i would rather 0 they didn't *t*-1
1042:9	so, maybe that is a, a little bit of what privacy is *t*-1.	maybe	###i mean, you can't believe that.###speakerb62.###right.###right.###speakera63.### it would, it would be pirated *-1###and they wouldn't bother *-1 to check that carefully anyway to someone who *t*-2's offering, you know, full cash price, for it.###speakerb64.###right.###speakera65.###i mean, you know, you can't tell it, what a company really has *-1 to do *t*-2 with it###and there's something rather ominous about * having virtually anyone, any hacker being able *-1 to know what your income is *t*-2, what your spending habits are *t*-3,### and, you know, and, and that hacker just has *-1 to get in to, in touch with the sneak thief###and suddenly and then what *t*-1 started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home.###speakerb66.###uh-huh.###and i guess 0 that turns out *-1 to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you're feeling, threatened as a result of, of it###speakera67.###yeah.###speakerb68.
1060:5	certainly the language 0 i know *t*-1 doesn't, but just says a word for loneliness.	certainly	###yeah.###speakerb68.###so, maybe that is a, a little bit of what privacy is *t*-1.###speakera69.###yes.###exactly.###speakerb70.###speakera71.###uh-huh.###i also thought about it, was of, uh, *-1 waiting *-2 to talk to you that, another thing that *t*-4 occurred to me is 0 there is not so much invasion of my privacy because i know how *-5 to behave *t*-6 such that there isn't *?*.###but i realized 0 i have *-1 to behave in a certain way in order *-2 to not have people invade my privacy.###if i deviate from social norms of behavior, if i run up and down the street *-1 yelling or something, someone's going *-2 to invade my privacy very quickly.###speakerb72.###uh-huh.###speakera73.###and i realize that that, i mean, i can take that for granted###but i used *-1 to, i used *-2 to live in india###and things are quite different *ich*-1 there in terms of that.###there's less of a sense of privacy.###in fact, it *exp*-2's said *-1 that no indian language has a word for privacy,
1172:65	or you hear somebody all ready starting, reading off a list of stuff that they've read *t*-1 probably a thousand times that day already.	probably	###and normally when they call *t*-1, you're either in the shower,###or you're in the middle of * cooking something###and you have *-1 to stop everything *-2 to run to the phone.###speakerb2.###yes,###yes.### is, is that one that you're talking about *t*-1.###speakera3.###that was the big one 0 i'm talking about *t*-1.###i work weird hours,###and invariably just about the time, 0 i'm going *-1 to sleep *t*-2, the phone tears off the wall.###speakerb4.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera5.###and you are trying *-1 to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone,### you either hear, the cli-, as soon as you say hello, you hear the click of the recording coming on,###speakerb6.###uh-huh.###speakera7.
1276:8	i probably could do the same thing, uh, you know,	probably	###and, uh, i don't know,###i just, um, don't particularly care for that at all.###and that, that's one thing that i feel really strongly about *t*-1 though, is, uh, you know, people *ich*-2 coming up to my door, and especially religious organizations and wanting *-3 to uh, you know, to try and get me to join or, you know, become interested in their religion,###because i have my own.###speakera21.###now the part about where you said 0 the apartment complex puts up signs that *t*-1 says no soliciting *t*-2,###i've even gone so far as *-1 to put that,###i've got a storm door on the front of the house###and i've put, in,###i don't know how much clearer it can be *t*-1,###it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting.### i should have, i guess 0 i should make another one that *t*-1 says religious or otherwise, cause i still get,###speakerb22.###yeah,###yeah,###that's true,###yeah.###no### i don't, uh, i don't have, i didn't go that far###but, uh, yeah
1401:32	and i feel like the next generation, you'll probably just work right along with your husband, you know.	probably	###speakera18.###are you ready now?###speakerb19.###yes.###speakera20.###okay,###like i said i guess 0 it would be the work force, you know, as far as changes in the generations.###speakerb21.###yes,###i know because, i know 0 when my mother was a, you know, going into the work force *t*-1 there wasn't very many opportunities for her, i guess,###she's in her late forties.###you were expected *-1 to stay home and take care of the kids###and i've never faced that at all.###speakera22.###uh, no,###i think 0 no-, now, you go to work when they're six weeks old, you know *t*-1,###speakerb23.###uh-huh.###speakera24.###and you stay there.
1405:21	i think 0 it's definitely gotten better.	definitely	###speakera20.###okay,###like i said i guess 0 it would be the work force, you know, as far as changes in the generations.###speakerb21.###yes,###i know because, i know 0 when my mother was a, you know, going into the work force *t*-1 there wasn't very many opportunities for her, i guess,###she's in her late forties.###you were expected *-1 to stay home and take care of the kids###and i've never faced that at all.###speakera22.###uh, no,###i think 0 no-, now, you go to work when they're six weeks old, you know *t*-1,###speakerb23.###uh-huh.###speakera24.###and you stay there.###and i feel like the next generation, you'll probably just work right along with your husband, you know.###speakerb25.###yeah,###uh-huh,
1452:19	i kind of think, maybe in time, that, you know, you'll go by social security numbers, you know,	maybe	###speakerb37.###hopefully, the next generation, it won't even be an issue,###i mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman,###speakera38.###yeah,###yeah.###speakerb39.###i think 0 that would be the best goal.###speakera40.###oh, i do too,###just your qualifications###and that would be it.###speakerb41.###uh-huh,###exactly,###not what color you are *t*-1, how old you are *t*-2, what you're male or female.###that would be wonderful,###i guess 0 it's kind of an ideal world though, huh.###speakera42.###yeah,
1635:20	and i know 0 she probably didn't make hardly anything, you know, compared to the work that she did *t*-1.	probably	###speakera100.###uh-huh.###well i think 0 we've really come a long way in that because,###speakerb101.###uh-huh,###i guess 0 i take it for granted, kind of, because, i just,###it's always been that way.###speakera102.###uh-huh.###speakerb103.###but i know,###speakera104.###yeah,###but i can rem-, remember 0 back * growing up, my mother,###i mean it was###she always worked,###but it *exp*-1 wasn't that easy for her to just take off.###speakerb105.###oh no,###i can remember my mother getting in trouble if, you know, one of was sick,
1659:16	well, i should probably get back to my job.	probably	###i think 0 there is still some discrimination there where as, you know, men and women work in the same job *t*-1,###i think 0 men get paid *-1 more,###speakera108.###oh, i do too.###speakerb109.###but i think 0 that's improving.###it's such a slow process###it's frustrating,###but, you can see that it's wrong###speakera110.###yes,###yes.###speakerb111.###and you just want *-1 to make it right,###but at least the wheels are moving forward.###speakera112.###they really are *?*.###speakerb113.###yeah,###i think 0 it's getting better, not worse.
1813:22	well, ma-, maybe it wasn't that one.	maybe	###speakerb48.###yeah.###speakera49.###* seems *-1 to be the hot one of, of today.###he used, um, wild thing.###do you remember that, that song.###speakerb50.###yeah.###speakera51.###he used, um,###i can't remember who the artist was *t*-1 on that.###speakerb52.###jimi hendrix was the original.###speakera53.###who?###speakerb54.###jimi hendrix was the original.###he wrote,###speakera55.###was it,
1886:15	i think that probably what *t*-1 did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer.	probably	###i did too.###speakera73.###it was,###ugh, i didn't like that either.###speakerb74.###yeah,###but you know, whatever *t*-1 became of peter frampton.###i mean, there was nothing,###he was a phenomenon,###i me-, there was no reason for him to really come into, you know, great stardom or anything.###speakera75.###i remember, 0 i saw him in a concert, when i was,###speakerb76.###yeah.###yeah,### i think, i think 0 it,###speakera77.###i think 0 it was in high school.###speakerb78.###yeah,
2184:35	and then we're also looking at it in *-1 possibly getting a mutual fund.	possibly	###speakera39.###yeah,###mostly what we're doing, we've worked, we've done *t*-2 the, uh, coda account with t i where they, we put in so much a month *t*-1,### and then they,###or so much a pay check###and then they match it.###speakerb40.###yeah,###that's what we're doing *t*-1.###speakera41.###so that's, that's worked out pretty good###and then, i used *-1 to work for t i###and i have,###when i retired from there, or left *t*-1, i took the money 0 i that i had *t*-2 in mine and put it in an i r a###and we had an out, we had an existing i r a###so we have, both of us have some money in an i r a that we're also trying *-1 to figure *t*-2,### * to, put it, we're putting it in c d's right now,###speakerb42.###uh-huh.###speakera43.
2298:35	but it is self improvement from the standpoint of * probably relaxing, uh.	probably	###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###how about yourself?###speakera13.###well, um, i have an interest in art,###so i, frequently purchase and read, uh, books, mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment.###speakerb14.###oh, that's great.###speakera15.###and, uh, oh, i guess 0 i like a variety of things, uh, lots of fiction, uh, type books.###uh, right now i'm occasionally reading on a book about, uh, the mardi gras in new orleans and its history.###speakerb16.###uh-huh.###speakera17.###that's fairly interesting.###speakerb18.###i bet 0 that would be, rather interesting.###uh, that's, uh, self improvement,### that's, that's alwa-, well, that's kind of a hobby
2321:14	and as you probably well know, all of us are our own customer.	probably	###i don't know that i read anything strictly labeled * self improvement.###how about you?###speakerb20.###um, well i hate *-1 to,###yes,###i do.###speakera21.###speakerb22.### we, uh, we have these classes 0 we attend *t*-1, uh, management classes### and, and they give you books### and, and the last book, uh, matter of fact 0 i read *t*-1 was, at america's service by carl albrecht.###it talks about, uh, who the customer is *t*-1 and * being customer oriented, uh, which *t*-2 falls in line with the t i culture here at texas instruments.###speakera23.###yeah.###speakerb24.###uh, one of its great slogans is 0 if you're not serving the customer, you better be serving someone who *t*-1 is *?*.###speakera25.###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###uh, so that's all in self improvement * to stay focused on who the customer is *t*-1
2333:15	well, uh, maybe i am into some things *ich*-1 occasionally that i don't think of *t*-2 in terms of self improvement.	maybe	###speakera23.###yeah.###speakerb24.###uh, one of its great slogans is 0 if you're not serving the customer, you better be serving someone who *t*-1 is *?*.###speakera25.###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###uh, so that's all in self improvement * to stay focused on who the customer is *t*-1###and as you probably well know, all of us are our own customer.###you're my customer, i'm your customer, sort of thing.###speakera27.###right.###speakerb28.###um, every now and then i'm loaned *-3 a tape 0 i can stick *t*-1 in the, uh, in the car cassette set on the way home * to make the drive more enjoyable, talking about, uh, better outlooks on things and the philosophy of, of pat hagerty and these kind of, uh, mind stimulating philosophy type. which *t*-2 all, you know, betters yourself.###speakera29.###yeah.###speakerb30.###speakera31.###yeah,###yeah,
2372:68	i think 0 if somebody would say hey, * read these ten books because these are self-improvements, i would probably be turned *-1 off to them.	probably	###speakera39.###yes.###speakerb40.###so those are self improvements.###speakera41.###sure.###speakerb42.###um, our supervisor, uh, subtly bought all of us a book called * what every supervisor should know *t*-1. by a man, man named * doctor bittel, b i t t e l###speakera43.###um.###speakerb44.###and it's a very layman's, uh, uh, approach towards * managing different types of people.###and the very last chapter, and i haven't figured out why that one was last *t*-2, is how * to manage engineers *t*-1.###speakera45.###speakerb46.###so it's, it's ver-, it's interesting,###here again it's, it's casual reading###and it's not eaten up with a lot of, uh, mechanical stuff###and it's really excellent fast reading### and, uh, but as you say it's, it's sometimes it *exp*-1's difficult * to, to know if it's, you know,
2377:78	if he casually just walked into it and, uh, put down a stephen king book and i picked up one of them i might be a little more interested.	might	###sure.###speakerb42.###um, our supervisor, uh, subtly bought all of us a book called * what every supervisor should know *t*-1. by a man, man named * doctor bittel, b i t t e l###speakera43.###um.###speakerb44.###and it's a very layman's, uh, uh, approach towards * managing different types of people.###and the very last chapter, and i haven't figured out why that one was last *t*-2, is how * to manage engineers *t*-1.###speakera45.###speakerb46.###so it's, it's ver-, it's interesting,###here again it's, it's casual reading###and it's not eaten up with a lot of, uh, mechanical stuff###and it's really excellent fast reading### and, uh, but as you say it's, it's sometimes it *exp*-1's difficult * to, to know if it's, you know,###i think 0 if somebody would say hey, * read these ten books because these are self-improvements, i would probably be turned *-1 off to them.###speakera47.###yeah,###yeah.###speakerb48.
2418:18	i need *-1 to probably make a phone call or two.	probably	###you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other###but, uh, i think 0 sometimes the word is a little over used###speakerb56.### exactly, exactly right.###speakera57.###but,###speakerb58.###yeah, we, we have, i think 0 we, we name drop it a little too much and, and don't fully understand what, what it is *t*-1 0 we're saying.###i think 0 it's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk### and, and all that kind of rolls in together there,###speakera59.###yeah.###speakerb60.###but, uh, that's just kind of part of it.###speakera61.###okay,###well, any other comments.###speakerb62.###uh, not that i can think of *t*-1.###um, i think 0 i'm under my quota a little bit.
2543:5	maybe you can call them split skirts.	maybe	###we ended up *-1 getting called out on it.###speakera23.###oh, how awful.###it sounds like mister power hungry.###speakerb24.###yeah.###speakera25.###you know, just yesterday, though, i saw a girl in the spine out here at lewisville that *t*-1 had on a pair of shorts.###speakerb26.###uh-huh.###speakera27.###and i don't care,###you can call them split skirts###and you can call them culottes all 0 you want *t*-1###but these were shorts.###that's all 0 they were *t*-1.###speakerb28.###speakera29.###i don't care what else you call them *t*-1, you know,###if they're below the knee, okay,

4116:43	it could be 0 t i --ers, i think 0 *t*-1, probably are participating more than anybody else,	probably	###speakerb81.###i'm a payroll clerk.###just an accounting clerk.###speakera82.###at t i?###speakerb83.###no, uh,###i have a friend who *t*-1 works for t i###and i work for a tire service, here in,###speakera84.###oh, i see.###speakerb85.###i'm from dallas.###speakera86.###uh-huh.###well the last two people who *t*-1 have called, both worked for t i###and i just wondered.###speakerb87.###yeah,###yeah,
4174:149	uh, i, i think 0 what they are trying *-1 to say *t*-2, is that there is a great deal of historical truth, but 0 the interpretation that *t*-1 actually got into the writing of the bible itself is probably uh, after the what, uh, was is it *t*-2 the king james version when the committee did it, wrote the translation *t*-4, that so much was lost *-3 in the translation, particularly since most of the translations were in greek.	probably	###oh.###speakera102.###speakerb103.###right.###speakera104.###we could go back to television shows.###speakerb105.###well, you know, * speaking of public tv, have you caught any of this series on the bible?###speakera106.###yes,###i have *?*.###speakerb107.###i've heard that it's really against the, well i mean that it's coming out with the idea that the bible's not true.###speakera108.###well, no.###that's, uh,###you could interpret it that way.###speakerb109.###uh-huh.###speakera110.
4185:74	so, in, as to those types of interpretations, uh, really made a difference in how one might interpret the bible now *t*-1, and what it's at *t*-2.	might	###speakerb107.###i've heard that it's really against the, well i mean that it's coming out with the idea that the bible's not true.###speakera108.###well, no.###that's, uh,###you could interpret it that way.###speakerb109.###uh-huh.###speakera110.###uh, i, i think 0 what they are trying *-1 to say *t*-2, is that there is a great deal of historical truth, but 0 the interpretation that *t*-1 actually got into the writing of the bible itself is probably uh, after the what, uh, was is it *t*-2 the king james version when the committee did it, wrote the translation *t*-4, that so much was lost *-3 in the translation, particularly since most of the translations were in greek.###speakerb111.###yeah.###speakera112.###well, for example. in greek there are seven different words for love.###speakerb113.###right.###speakera114.###okay,###so you can have,###there's one word for love of your brother, one word for love of your wife, one word for, you know, uh, love of your father, and that sort of thing.
4287:10	and i probably get more exercise than your average person.	probably	###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###so, and how do you feel about it *t*-1?.###speakera13.###uh, i'm, i am a person who *t*-1 wishes 0 i had more time 0 * to exercise *t*-2.### i, i don't feel like i,###speakerb14.###speakera15.###i don't very often do things for the sake of exercise.###i don't feel well unless i am exercising###and i try *-1 to do things that *t*-2 involve exercise,###but, i very rarely do things like, um,###i've never done aerobics or any sort of structured,###this is my exercise time###speakerb16.###uh-huh.###speakera17.###but, i do lots of outdoor sports and things, bicycling, uh, you know, mountaineering, a little mountaineering, this and that,###and i spend a lot of time
4440:9	and, maybe not,	maybe	### i, i just assumed that i had,###this is the first call 0 i've done *t*-1,###speakera67.###uh-huh.###speakerb68.###and, i didn't realize that they ha-, were going *-1 to reach out to people from, all over the country.###speakera69.###speakerb70.###speakera71.###speakerb72.###you wouldn't know that.###oh, i,###speakera73.###so, it's the, it's, it's the, the act-, well it's actually,###it's interesting, because there are re-, real regional differences.###um, in california there's, uh, almost an assumption, um, unless you're, sort of, clearly of an older generation *ich*-1, or something, you know, in your sixties, or something like that,###speakerb74.###speakera75.### i'm, i'm, i'm not.###uh, there's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness, and, and, at least in urban california.
4676:35	it's, uh, it's definitely,	definitely	###we live close to dallas,###speakera147.###uh-huh.###speakerb148.###so, uh, which, you know,###you get, uh, an influx of a lot of people from all over the country,###so, you're going *-1 to have a lot of di-, more choices,###speakera149.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakerb150.### but, but, in urban areas it's, you know, steak places,###speakera151.###yeah.###yeah.###speakerb152.### an, and it's not a, you know,###speakera153.###yeah.###speakerb154.
4765:18	because, uh, most likely that will happen, won't it *?*, that, you know,	likely	###speakera25.###oh, i know,###i know.###i know.###um, i think 0 nowadays people just, really just,###murder is nothing to them, you know.###speakerb26.###well, i formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years, i guess 0 *t*-1.###and, i've come to the conclusion, and this is a pretty scary thought to me, even, that if a guy is convicted *-1, or a gal is convicted *-2, of a crime, rather than * put them in prison, because prison's proven *-3 not to work, just let them go.###* say okay, you're convicted *-1###speakera27.###huh-uh.###speakerb28.###and * just let them go###speakera29.###yeah.###speakerb30.###and if they get convicted *-1 again, well, just * kill them.###speakera31.###yeah,
4831:13	at least they might get some benefit in that,	might	###hey, people make mistakes.###speakera51.###yeah,###* to go ahead and let them go,###but if they do it again and they really need *-1 to face the consequences then, uh.###speakerb52.###well, yeah,###* use that###or, you know, there's other consequences rather than * killing them, you know,###you could, always make them the slave of the people 0 they committed the crime against *t*-1.###speakera53.###oh.###speakerb54.###speakera55.###huh-uh.###speakerb56.###you know.###speakera57.###yeah.###speakerb58.
5080:26	i don't have them all yet certainly.	certainly	###oh, yeah.###speakerb22.###it was tough,###but, uh, yeah.###do you have any others,###or is this mainly cross-stitching?###speakera23.###um, i do mostly that, um,###not very artistic *t*-1 really for like painting and stuff.###speakerb24.###oh, uh-huh.###um, yeah.###speakera25.###but, now i don't know.###speakerb26.###i'm still trying *-1 to get all the d m c colors.###speakera27.###oh, really.###yeah,###i've got the kits 0 * to put them all in *t*-1.
5196:24	i've been doing it for probably ten years or so.	probably	###speakera61.###oh, yeah.###speakerb62.###oh, well, that's neat that you like *-1 cross-stitching also.###speakera63.###yeah,### that's, that's kind of strange that we got the same call.###speakerb64.###yeah.###speakera65.###it's a mumblex call.###speakerb66.###oh, i'm sorry.###* go ahead.###speakera67.###no,###that's okay.###speakerb68.###okay, uh,###but, yeah,
5352:30	and they were saying that c n n is definitely a world, uh, news service	definitely	###c b s.###speakera13.###they all were, were tapped *-1 into c n n.###speakerb14.###were they *?*?###speakera15.###uh-uh.###speakerb16.###yeah.###speakera17.###that's the only thing 0 they broadcast *t*-1###and like you i listened to radio on my job at work.###speakerb18.###uh-huh.###speakera19.###and all this week they have been having this, uh, a discussion about 0 that is why, uh, why c n n was###well, i listen to a christian radio station.###speakerb20.###uh-huh.###speakera21.
5374:45	i guess, 0 the news just focuses on major events that *t*-1 probably, don't affect ninety-nine percent of the people who *t*-2 are right there when the news is being made *-3 *t*-4.	probably	###it was,###you can't really be sure of the quality of what you've got *t*-1, you know.###speakerb22.###huh.###speakera23.###uh, we had some, uh, some people from our church 0 *t*-1 went to israel, uh, just for a, uh, tour sort of thing.###speakerb24.###uh-huh.###speakera25.###and i was watching on tv### they, they broadcast this terrible riot *ich*-2 supposedly that *t*-1 was going on in jerusalem,###so we got all fearful for our people,###* come *-1 to find out 0 they came back and said 0 they weren't even aware of it,###speakerb26.###right.###speakera27.###and so it really made me question as to what, how do we know, you know, uh, if the news 0 we're getting *t*-2 is any good *t*-1.###so,###speakerb28.###yeah,
5658:63	so, so i mean, it's like this, this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people	probably	### all, all 0 you have *t*-1 is like towns built * around universities.###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###speakera39.###like chapel hill?###speakerb40.###yeah.###so it, it's basically a bunch of small towns anyway.###kind of quaint little towns###but they don't have a whole lot there.###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###speakera43.###where you at *t*-1?###speakerb44.###uh, well, i'm in monterey, california right now.###yeah.###speakera45.###oh, okay.
5733:8	i probably won't do it until i,	probably	###i,###uh, * let's face it, you know.###and, you know, i, you know, did the, you know,###as far as,###i found it a lot of times with, regards to education, you know,###the school only takes you so far, you know.###it's what you do *t*-1. you know.###speakera69.###yeah.###speakerb70.###so, uh, i don't lose any sleep, sleep over stuff like that.###speakera71.###so, are, are you going *-1 to go for your doctorate?###speakerb72.###probably not.###see i'm in the navy.###speakera73.###yeah.###speakerb74.###and, uh, you know, most of the navy funds that
5738:10	oh, probably be another twelve years.	probably	###the school only takes you so far, you know.###it's what you do *t*-1. you know.###speakera69.###yeah.###speakerb70.###so, uh, i don't lose any sleep, sleep over stuff like that.###speakera71.###so, are, are you going *-1 to go for your doctorate?###speakerb72.###probably not.###see i'm in the navy.###speakera73.###yeah.###speakerb74.###and, uh, you know, most of the navy funds that###i probably won't do it until i,###if i do do it, it will be after i get out of the navy.###speakera75.###when do you get out *t*-1?###speakerb76.
5756:43	they've, i think 0 they have maybe two people a year go *-1 get, get their p h d.	maybe	###when do you get out *t*-1?###speakerb76.###oh, probably be another twelve years.###speakera77.###oh, okay.###speakerb78.###oh, you know i like what i'm doing *t*-1 right now.###speakera79.### but, uh, but what if they pay for it?###speakerb80.###* excuse me?###speakera81.###what if they pay for?###speakerb82.###if they pay for a p h d?###speakera83.###yeah.###speakerb84.###nah,###they won't pay for it.
5832:130	i mean, like i say, if you're, if you're, you know, if you're at an upper level in the rank category, you know, you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year.	probably	###speakera107.###but i mean, i mean, you,###the,###once you get your masters, you can be earning between, anywhere between like thirty-seven, forty-five thousand a year.###speakerb108.###uh-huh.###speakera109.### and and that's not what they're paying *t*-1.###speakerb110.###oh, easily,###i'm sure.###speakera111.###speakerb112.###no.###well, it depends on what rank you are *t*-1, of course.###speakera113.###yeah.###yeah,###i know.###speakerb114.
5947:62	people generally go with that because they figure that the, you know, you probably won't get fired *-1 for *-2 getting i b m material.	probably	###no.###and then this guy from federal, federal express comes along.###they go what's that *t*-1?###this track which *t*-2 it's going around the world###and they can tell you where your package is *t*-1 anywhere, any time.###speakerb150.###uh-huh.###speakera151.###and so it's like the same thing with i b m. you know,###so they have this think tank.###and they got *-1 to come up with ideas.###but, see, uh, the, the thing is, that i b m is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff.###speakerb152.###yeah.###oh, yeah.### they've got a, they've got basically a, uh, you know, a lock on a lot of the market.###speakera153.###yeah.###speakerb154.###and a lot of times you figure, you know, with the support that they provide *t*-1, you know,
6184:30	and i think that, uh, we've probably got one of the best around, you know,	probably	###no.###speakerb232.###like a hologram?###speakera233.### this is like, this is like video game stuff.###speakerb234.###with just graphics on, on a,###speakera235.###okay?###speakerb236.###okay.###speakera237.###but the only thing was, that it was just lines,###okay.###like if you,###speakera1.###well, what d-, do you think *t*-1 in terms of, uh, benefits?###speakerb2.###well, personally, you know, i think, you know,###of course i'm sure 0 we're familiar with the exact same benefit package
6206:23	and i suspect that that's probably true for everyone.	probably	###and the paid time off is wonderful,###and, uh, one of the things that we were just talking about *t*-1 as a matter of fact this week at work was the coda plan that *t*-2 is offered *-3###and i think 0 that is just a, a fabulous one,###so. i don't know if you participate in that or not,###but###speakera3.###absolutely.###speakerb4.###isn't it great?### it's just a, it *exp*-2's just a miracle that how fast that adds up *t*-1, you know.###speakera5.###well, i have *-1 to agree with that.###you know, i was thinking about, uh, importance of benefits and that kind of thing, other than salary while i was waiting for, uh, the system to find a, a respondent.###speakerb6.###uh-huh###speakera7.###speakerb8.###uh-huh.###speakera9.###and i started *-1 thinking that over the years that importance has changed
6232:13	and that's certainly one of the reasons that i'm sure 0 *t*-2 that they've begun the, uh, coda plan *t*-1.	certainly	###and the retirement is more important.###speakerb12.###i had never really thought of it that way###but i guess 0 that's true,###i guess 0 that's true.###i'm still young enough that, that, uh, the vacation's real important to me###and the paid time off *ich*-1 is real important to me and, and that kind of thing.###but, uh, you know, i was just, as a matter of fact, i just, uh, celebrated my fifth year at t i the end of last month and, uh, kind of started *-1 looking through the, the book because of that, you know,###now that i'm a hundred percent vested *-1, you know, you kind of look through the book and see well, what exactly, what does that mean *t*-2 and what is the pension all about *t*-3###and, you know, when you're, when you're, you know, in your,###i'm only in my late twenties now,###so you tend *-1 not to think about retirement.###but, uh, it's,###i guess 0 now is the time 0 * to think about it *t*-1,###so. does t i have a pretty good retirement package, do you think?###speakera13.###i think 0 they have, uh, a-, one that we need *-3 to recognize that we're going *-1 to have *-2 to supplement *t*-4 ourselves.###speakerb14.###yeah.###speakera15.
6236:11	it's certainly a, a supplemental way,	certainly	###i guess 0 that's true.###i'm still young enough that, that, uh, the vacation's real important to me###and the paid time off *ich*-1 is real important to me and, and that kind of thing.###but, uh, you know, i was just, as a matter of fact, i just, uh, celebrated my fifth year at t i the end of last month and, uh, kind of started *-1 looking through the, the book because of that, you know,###now that i'm a hundred percent vested *-1, you know, you kind of look through the book and see well, what exactly, what does that mean *t*-2 and what is the pension all about *t*-3###and, you know, when you're, when you're, you know, in your,###i'm only in my late twenties now,###so you tend *-1 not to think about retirement.###but, uh, it's,###i guess 0 now is the time 0 * to think about it *t*-1,###so. does t i have a pretty good retirement package, do you think?###speakera13.###i think 0 they have, uh, a-, one that we need *-3 to recognize that we're going *-1 to have *-2 to supplement *t*-4 ourselves.###speakerb14.###yeah.###speakera15.###and that's certainly one of the reasons that i'm sure 0 *t*-2 that they've begun the, uh, coda plan *t*-1.###speakerb16.###uh-huh.###speakera17.
6241:44	and i suppose 0 if, b-, maybe in, in your instance, if, if you're started *-1 with t i in your early to mid-twenties, and happen *-1 to stay with them until you're sixty-five, then you'll have a very good retirement plan.	maybe	###and, you know, when you're, when you're, you know, in your,###i'm only in my late twenties now,###so you tend *-1 not to think about retirement.###but, uh, it's,###i guess 0 now is the time 0 * to think about it *t*-1,###so. does t i have a pretty good retirement package, do you think?###speakera13.###i think 0 they have, uh, a-, one that we need *-3 to recognize that we're going *-1 to have *-2 to supplement *t*-4 ourselves.###speakerb14.###yeah.###speakera15.###and that's certainly one of the reasons that i'm sure 0 *t*-2 that they've begun the, uh, coda plan *t*-1.###speakerb16.###uh-huh.###speakera17.###it's certainly a, a supplemental way,###uh,###speakerb18.###uh-huh.###speakera19.
6261:56	you know, one of the things that we're doing *t*-1 which *t*-2 is probably the worst investment in the world,	probably	###and i suppose 0 if, b-, maybe in, in your instance, if, if you're started *-1 with t i in your early to mid-twenties, and happen *-1 to stay with them until you're sixty-five, then you'll have a very good retirement plan.###speakerb20.###right.###speakera21.###but i had another career first and then came to t i a little later.###speakerb22.###uh-huh.###speakera23.###so it's not, uh,###all by itself it won't be adequate for, for my situation.###speakerb24.###it's not going *-1 to build up, quite enough,###speakera25.###speakerb26.###yeah.###speakera27.###so, i have *-1 to find a way 0 * to supplement that *t*-2.###speakerb28.###yeah.###well, they just, they seem *-1 to make it *exp*-2 so easy * to save.
6263:13	and it's probably not a great investment,	probably	###right.###speakera21.###but i had another career first and then came to t i a little later.###speakerb22.###uh-huh.###speakera23.###so it's not, uh,###all by itself it won't be adequate for, for my situation.###speakerb24.###it's not going *-1 to build up, quite enough,###speakera25.###speakerb26.###yeah.###speakera27.###so, i have *-1 to find a way 0 * to supplement that *t*-2.###speakerb28.###yeah.###well, they just, they seem *-1 to make it *exp*-2 so easy * to save.###you know, one of the things that we're doing *t*-1 which *t*-2 is probably the worst investment in the world,###but i've got money coming out mumblex *ich*-2 0 * to buy savings bonds *t*-1, just coming straight out of my check.
6289:7	and maybe you don't start *-1 looking for that word guaranteed, until later.	maybe	###i unders-, understand though,###it,###speakerb30.###yeah.###speakera31.###uh, * believe me,###i do that myself.###speakerb32.###do you?###yeah?###speakera33.###and i disagree with you.###i don't think 0 it's the worst investment, in the world.###speakerb34.###do you really not?###speakera35.###speakerb36.### i, i, fr-, you know, i, i debate about whether it's really good or not, you know.###speakera37.###well, it's, in terms of guaranteed return on investment
6382:18	i think that i probably want *-1 to be a veterinarian.	probably	###and boy, it gets really scary when you start *-1 talking to them *t*-2.###uh, i have a, an eleven year old daughter *ich*-3 now who *t*-1's saying, gee, dad, i want *-2 to be an allergist,###speakerb58.###oh, goodness.###speakera59.###and i said, that's wonderful.###i applaud that.###* let, me explain to you how you get scholarships * to do that *t*-1.###speakerb60.###yeah.###speakera61.###speakerb62.###yeah.###exactly.###speakera63.###and, then her little brother's only two years behind###speakerb64.###exactly.###speakera65.###and he says, well, i don't know,
6409:50	uh, i can see some, some potential changes that *t*-1 probably are, are, would not cost very much but might, uh, make things a little easier. such as * offering a, a smorgasbord. having a larger variety of benefits	probably	###that's right.###well, you know, t i, you know, t i offers some good stuff###and then i think 0 there's, i mean i think 0 there's some negatives,###but there's going *-1 to be some negatives anywhere, you know, no matter where you go *t*-2.###i have, you know, all,###this is the first really large company 0 i've worked for *t*-1.###i've always been involved in little small, you know, ind-, privately owned s-, owned firms###and so i've never had the, the big benefit package.###so, i really don't know how * to compare it to other big companies *t*-1, you know.### it, when i came on *t*-1 it was great because i had never had anything even close to what, what they offered *t*-2.###so, i've been real pleased.###speakera69.###well, that's fantastic,###speakerb70.###yeah.###speakera71.###and on whole o-, i would say that they're equal to, uh, most of our competitors.###speakerb72.###* think so?###speakera73.
6409:100	uh, i can see some, some potential changes that *t*-1 probably are, are, would not cost very much but might, uh, make things a little easier. such as * offering a, a smorgasbord. having a larger variety of benefits	might	###that's right.###well, you know, t i, you know, t i offers some good stuff###and then i think 0 there's, i mean i think 0 there's some negatives,###but there's going *-1 to be some negatives anywhere, you know, no matter where you go *t*-2.###i have, you know, all,###this is the first really large company 0 i've worked for *t*-1.###i've always been involved in little small, you know, ind-, privately owned s-, owned firms###and so i've never had the, the big benefit package.###so, i really don't know how * to compare it to other big companies *t*-1, you know.### it, when i came on *t*-1 it was great because i had never had anything even close to what, what they offered *t*-2.###so, i've been real pleased.###speakera69.###well, that's fantastic,###speakerb70.###yeah.###speakera71.###and on whole o-, i would say that they're equal to, uh, most of our competitors.###speakerb72.###* think so?###speakera73.
6443:16	well, i could certainly, personally stand *-1 seeing them go to a, a standardized compensatory time for overtime.	certainly	###it's menu selection, so, * to speak.###speakerb80.###right.###speakera81.###speakerb82.###that sounds really good.###i read a thing,###i don't even remember if it was in the dallasite *rnr*-1 or the insite *rnr*-1 one, about uh, companies allowing you,###and they said that t i was looking into it, * to purchase extra vacation days. which i thought 0 *t*-1 sounded like a good idea.###you know, if you've been there, you know, under five years and you get two weeks of vacation but that's really not enough and you want an extra week, then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by *-2 saying, okay, i'm going *-1 to want an extra five days this year###and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck, you know,###and they're deducting it all along,###so you, you can have an extra five days off and be paid *-1 for them at the time, you know,###you're really not being paid *-1 for them,###the money is actually coming out of your own pocket,###but it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once, you know.###so, that is kind of an idea that, that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in *t*-1###and t i said that they were looking into something like that###so,###speakera83.
6460:32	uh, and, and i would certainly support something like four to one or five to one	certainly	###and t i said that they were looking into something like that###so,###speakera83.###well, i could certainly, personally stand *-1 seeing them go to a, a standardized compensatory time for overtime.###speakerb84.###uh-huh.###speakera85.###speakerb86.###uh-huh.###speakera87.###and i don't believe 0 any of us would have *-1 to purchase any extra vacation days, if they did, that.###speakerb88.###well,###speakera89.###speakerb90.###true.###speakera91.###speakerb92.###true.###speakera93.
6461:33	or, or, you know, maybe they want *-1 to get generous and make it three to one.	maybe	###so,###speakera83.###well, i could certainly, personally stand *-1 seeing them go to a, a standardized compensatory time for overtime.###speakerb84.###uh-huh.###speakera85.###speakerb86.###uh-huh.###speakera87.###and i don't believe 0 any of us would have *-1 to purchase any extra vacation days, if they did, that.###speakerb88.###well,###speakera89.###speakerb90.###true.###speakera91.###speakerb92.###true.###speakera93.###uh, and, and i would certainly support something like four to one or five to one
6489:30	but, but then it's probably that way anywhere, you know,	probably	###speakerb98.###yeah.###speakera99.###speakerb100.###yeah.###speakera101.###but it should be a standard and, and not left *-1 up to either the whim or the current overhead rate t-, uh, that *t*-2's running in each department.###speakerb102.###uh-huh.###well,###and, yeah,### and, and a lot of that is left *-1 up to whoever your supervisor happens *-2 to be *t*-4 and what type of relationship *ich*-5 you have *t*-3 with that person###and, you know, i see a lot of differences, but, from one group to the next, you know, about who *t*-1 gets it and who *t*-2 doesn't get it, you know.### but that's, and that's that way with a lot of things, you know, there.###it seems like, it *ich*-7 depends on what, what group you happen *-1 to be in *t*-3, what, what you're going *-2 to get *t*-4 and what you're not going *-5 to get *t*-6###so,###speakera103.###well, that's for sure.###speakerb104.###which *t*-1 is the same,
6509:34	or, you know, they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time	maybe	### but, but then it's probably that way anywhere, you know,###that's,###speakera105.###oh, i'm sure 0 personalities always come into play.###speakerb106.###uh-huh.###speakera107.###uh, just in this size of organization,###speakera1.###okay.###the question was, um, what, what is your opinion of youth, uh, spending a year or two in, in public service *t*-1.###speakerb2.###i think 0 it would be a great idea.###i'm not sure about * requiring it, you know, of people, because people are going, you know, feeling resentful.###i don't know,###but i think 0 it would be a great idea.###speakera3.###yeah.###speakerb4.###* seems like there's so many kids that *t*-1 don't have any since of, you know, what they want *-2 to be *t*-3 or do *t*-3
6534:12	i think possibly what, uh, they're thinking about *t*-1 here, more external peace corps, type things where we're sending people off shore *t*-3.	possibly	### would, uh, would you be more in favor of, uh, you know, like a local, uh,###my only experience with it, i was in central america *ich*-1 for a while, and, uh, in san salvador, in el salvador,###speakerb6.###huh-uh.###speakera7.###speakerb8.###huh-uh.###speakera9.###for instance, everybody had what they called *t*-1 there social year, that they had *-2 to put *t*-3 in###speakerb10.###oh, really.###speakera11.###and basically it was a, uh, repayment for, for, uh, high school education,###speakerb12.###huh-uh.###speakera13.###and most of them joined the red cross###and it was done *-1 internally.###i just,###there was very little external.
6545:51	if you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe countries that *t*-1 are so poor that they wouldn't be able *-2 to really, you know, send children to do that.	maybe	###speakera11.###and basically it was a, uh, repayment for, for, uh, high school education,###speakerb12.###huh-uh.###speakera13.###and most of them joined the red cross###and it was done *-1 internally.###i just,###there was very little external.###i think possibly what, uh, they're thinking about *t*-1 here, more external peace corps, type things where we're sending people off shore *t*-3.###speakerb14.###yeah.###speakera15.###speakerb16.###well, i think 0 that would be real interesting 0 for people to do *t*-1,###but, i guess, 0 my concern about that would be the cost involved * * trying *-1 to train people in a new language and ship them, you know, to other countries,###speakera17.###huh-uh.###speakerb18.### and, but, i don't know.
6585:14	but it *exp*-1 might be interesting * to see what *t*-2 would happen if you took kids at a, and then took then to another country instead of * having being exposed *-5 to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here, and take them to some other country that *t*-3 had different moral values, like saudi arabia where they couldn't drink *t*-4.	might	###i know that they trained you in the language###and, um,###speakera27.###that's what i was wondering about *t*-1 was whether they actually,###speakerb28.###you actually got paid *-1 too, while in the peace corps,###it wasn't much,###speakera29.###yeah.###speakerb30.###but i guess, 0 they, you could put some money *ich*-1 aside while you were there, your expenses and,###speakera31.###wasn't * jimmy carter's mama that *t*-1 was in the peace corps?###speakerb32.###yeah,###i think so,###yeah,###yeah.###speakera33.###speakerb34.
6589:8	you might end up with a revolution.	might	###speakerb28.###you actually got paid *-1 too, while in the peace corps,###it wasn't much,###speakera29.###yeah.###speakerb30.###but i guess, 0 they, you could put some money *ich*-1 aside while you were there, your expenses and,###speakera31.###wasn't * jimmy carter's mama that *t*-1 was in the peace corps?###speakerb32.###yeah,###i think so,###yeah,###yeah.###speakera33.###speakerb34.###but it *exp*-1 might be interesting * to see what *t*-2 would happen if you took kids at a, and then took then to another country instead of * having being exposed *-5 to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here, and take them to some other country that *t*-3 had different moral values, like saudi arabia where they couldn't drink *t*-4.###speakera35.###where they couldn't do that *t*-1.###yeah,
6635:17	people that *t*-1 might benefit most from it *ich*-4 might not go in that situation, you know, like people that *t*-2 really are trapped *-3 in a ghetto or something like that.	might	###speakera45.###yeah.###well, i guess 0 that's, uh, the price of freedom, i guess, is a little, anyway,### the, uh, uh, the, the public service thing again### i, i, i guess, 0 in my own, * having had the whole three or four minutes 0 * to, you know, give it a great deal of thought *t*-1, you know, um, i, i think 0 i agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary,###speakerb46.###speakera47.###but when you do that *t*-1 then it becomes almost, uh, a mumblex,###or it can be *?*,###speakerb48.###yeah.###speakera49.###you know, there have,###people will kind of set up their own little club,###speakerb50.###yeah,###that's true.###speakera51.### and, uh, but if, you know,###speakerb52.
6635:35	people that *t*-1 might benefit most from it *ich*-4 might not go in that situation, you know, like people that *t*-2 really are trapped *-3 in a ghetto or something like that.	might	###speakera45.###yeah.###well, i guess 0 that's, uh, the price of freedom, i guess, is a little, anyway,### the, uh, uh, the, the public service thing again### i, i, i guess, 0 in my own, * having had the whole three or four minutes 0 * to, you know, give it a great deal of thought *t*-1, you know, um, i, i think 0 i agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary,###speakerb46.###speakera47.###but when you do that *t*-1 then it becomes almost, uh, a mumblex,###or it can be *?*,###speakerb48.###yeah.###speakera49.###you know, there have,###people will kind of set up their own little club,###speakerb50.###yeah,###that's true.###speakera51.### and, uh, but if, you know,###speakerb52.
6680:11	it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have *t*-1 here and develop some pride in them, if it was handled *-2 that way.	certainly	###speakera63.###i know 0 my dad always talked about, uh,###he was in c c c during, uh,###speakerb64.###yeah.###speakera65.###and he was, uh, a rock rib iowa type republican###and the only good thing 0 he could ever say *t*-1 about, uh, the whole roosevelt administration was, uh, civilian conservation corps,###speakerb66.###huh-uh.###speakera67.###because he was in it.###he thought 0 that was great.###speakerb68.###yeah.###speakera69.###the rest of it was all hog wash,###but that was great.###speakerb70.###well, it seems like it would develop pride, you know, in people, if, if, it's in their own country.
6683:18	i think 0 it might build jobs for people, you know, that *t*-1 were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that,	might	###speakerb64.###yeah.###speakera65.###and he was, uh, a rock rib iowa type republican###and the only good thing 0 he could ever say *t*-1 about, uh, the whole roosevelt administration was, uh, civilian conservation corps,###speakerb66.###huh-uh.###speakera67.###because he was in it.###he thought 0 that was great.###speakerb68.###yeah.###speakera69.###the rest of it was all hog wash,###but that was great.###speakerb70.###well, it seems like it would develop pride, you know, in people, if, if, it's in their own country.###it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have *t*-1 here and develop some pride in them, if it was handled *-2 that way.### i, i,###it would take quite a few people.
6684:7	so maybe that part of it would be helpful too.	maybe	###yeah.###speakera65.###and he was, uh, a rock rib iowa type republican###and the only good thing 0 he could ever say *t*-1 about, uh, the whole roosevelt administration was, uh, civilian conservation corps,###speakerb66.###huh-uh.###speakera67.###because he was in it.###he thought 0 that was great.###speakerb68.###yeah.###speakera69.###the rest of it was all hog wash,###but that was great.###speakerb70.###well, it seems like it would develop pride, you know, in people, if, if, it's in their own country.###it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have *t*-1 here and develop some pride in them, if it was handled *-2 that way.### i, i,###it would take quite a few people.###i think 0 it might build jobs for people, you know, that *t*-1 were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that,
6898:80	well, um, with credit cards is, me, i, uh, i try *-1 to get maybe just one or two,	maybe	###but, i,###speakerb144.### they, they don't get paid *-1 for it,### and, um, but there is funding that *t*-1 comes,###they're supposedly saving up on their own###and the church helps them out some,###speakera145.###huh-uh.###speakerb146.###but, you know, that it is incredible, you know.###speakera147.###i see how they were organized *-1 in, central and south america *t*-2###speakerb148.###yeah.###speakera149.###and, uh, it's, uh,###speakerb150.###yeah.###speakera151.###speakerb1.
7376:18	i'd say 0 probably for maybe fifteen years, we dabbled in that, you know,	probably	###they have some nice stuff down there.###speakera77.###speakerb78.###i miss it.###speakera79.###well, yeah,### it's, uh, it's, uh, it's, uh,### there's, uh, there's pluses to everything,###speakerb80.###oh, yeah.###speakera81.###but, you know, * seems like there's just so many things 0 * to do *t*-1 down here,###i like the sports,###i play a lot of racquetball.###speakerb82.### we did, mumblex i did horseback riding, too,###in fact, when my children were growing up *t*-1, we always had horses###and, uh, that was kind of for them,###but they weren't as interested in it as we were *?*, you know,###so, uh, that was a real,
7376:25	i'd say 0 probably for maybe fifteen years, we dabbled in that, you know,	maybe	###they have some nice stuff down there.###speakera77.###speakerb78.###i miss it.###speakera79.###well, yeah,### it's, uh, it's, uh, it's, uh,### there's, uh, there's pluses to everything,###speakerb80.###oh, yeah.###speakera81.###but, you know, * seems like there's just so many things 0 * to do *t*-1 down here,###i like the sports,###i play a lot of racquetball.###speakerb82.### we did, mumblex i did horseback riding, too,###in fact, when my children were growing up *t*-1, we always had horses###and, uh, that was kind of for them,###but they weren't as interested in it as we were *?*, you know,###so, uh, that was a real,
7416:21	i know 0 it's probably late for you,	probably	###i know,###i know,###it's true.###speakera89.###there's buildings and concrete and a lot of people###and that's about it down here,###and so,###speakerb90.###uh-huh.###speakera91.###yeah.###but, uh, that's great.###well, * sounds like you have a lot of nice hobbies there.###speakerb92.###yeah,###you too,###you too.###speakera93.###well, great,###well * look, uh,
7480:39	they're real liberal now and to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago, um, the democrat party being liberal like they are *?* now, you know, would never be thought of *-2 *t*-1,	probably	###and, uh, the people that *t*-1 are independent, you know, are the ones that *t*-2 don't, uh, don't really, uh, show up every year because they can't seem *-5 to, to decide which *t*-3 are the good aspects *rnr*-6 and which *t*-4 are the bad aspects *rnr*-6 of a candidate.###speakera8.###right,###yeah,###speakerb9.###yeah.###speakera10.###that's good.###speakerb11.###ye-,###i always thought### it was###back when anderson was running *t*-1, i was hoping that things would change and he'd actually get elected *-2 and party politics would start *-3 going down the tubes,###but, um, that didn't work.###speakera12.###yeah.###speakerb13.###speakera14.###yeah,###there's, uh, a lot of extremes on the parties, too, with the you know, the real, uh, far side of the democrats
7546:15	you know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you know, like the no new taxes thing.	maybe	###speakera30.###yeah,###that's true that the different places in america that, uh, you know, different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place.###speakerb31.###yeah,###i can understand why, why some of the, the rural areas, the voter turnout isn't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in d c are like controlling things for the, the midwest *t*-1,###speakera32.###uh-huh.###speakerb33.###and, uh, it *exp*-4 doesn't matter who they put *t*-3 in office, they're going *-1 to fall subject to, uh, the pressure that the lobbyists can put *t*-2,###speakera34.###right.###yeah,###and it *exp*-3's, uh, real true that, uh, you know, they'll say one thing, *-1 to get elected *,###speakerb35.###speakera36.###and then once they do get elected *-1, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness 0 *-4 to do those things that they promised *t*-2, you know, beforehand *t*-3.###speakerb37.###right.###speakera38.
7555:21	i think 0 he can probably raise taxes and still get elected *-1.	probably	###and, uh, it *exp*-4 doesn't matter who they put *t*-3 in office, they're going *-1 to fall subject to, uh, the pressure that the lobbyists can put *t*-2,###speakera34.###right.###yeah,###and it *exp*-3's, uh, real true that, uh, you know, they'll say one thing, *-1 to get elected *,###speakerb35.###speakera36.###and then once they do get elected *-1, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness 0 *-4 to do those things that they promised *t*-2, you know, beforehand *t*-3.###speakerb37.###right.###speakera38.###you know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you know, like the no new taxes thing.###you know, that's, uh,###with the economy going the way 0 it is *?* *t*-1 and everything, that was nearly ridiculous thing *-2 to, even try *-3 to do.###speakerb39.###yeah.###speakera40.###speakerb41.###yeah.###well, i don't think 0 he's going *-1 to have *-2 to worry about that next year.
7568:14	unfortunately that will probably even drop lower, the voters turndown, mumblex even more because more democrats will think that they don't have a shot	probably	###with the economy going the way 0 it is *?* *t*-1 and everything, that was nearly ridiculous thing *-2 to, even try *-3 to do.###speakerb39.###yeah.###speakera40.###speakerb41.###yeah.###well, i don't think 0 he's going *-1 to have *-2 to worry about that next year.###i think 0 he can probably raise taxes and still get elected *-1.###speakera42.###right.###speakerb43.###uh,###speakera44.###right,###after the war.###speakerb45.###uh-huh.###speakera46.###that really, uh,###speakerb47.
7643:34	well, i figured 0 with texas instruments they'd probably have a few, uh, texans on the line now and then.	probably	###speakerb65.###yeah.###speakera66.###what part of the country are you from *t*-1?###speakerb67.###uh, washington, d c,###speakera68.###are you really *?*?###speakerb69.###uh-huh.###speakera70.###wow.###this is,###i'm in, from,###this is dallas where i'm at *t*-1.###speakerb71.###oh, okay.###speakera72.###the outskirts of dallas.###speakerb73.
7665:24	and i thought, wow, that might be interesting.	might	###yeah,### do, do you work for t i in any way?###speakerb75.###no,###huh-uh.###speakera76.###wow,### how did you, how did they get you *t*-1?###speakerb77.###um, they mumblex, they went through engineering companies,###speakera78.###oh.###speakerb79.###and, uh, we're communications.### i, i work in a communications company.###speakera80.###oh, okay,###right.###i work for t i###so, we saw it on the, uh, t news one day
7691:7	so maybe i'll figure it out.	maybe	###speakerb83.###they called me at, uh, ten o'clock one night,###that was very strange.###speakera84.###yeah.###speakerb85.###i guess 0 they were doing mumblex eastern standard time.###i was like,###i don't know how long it takes *t*-1 whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes.###speakera86.###yeah,###central standard time is what they're doing it by *t*-1.###speakerb87.###yeah.###speakera88.###yeah.###i still haven't figured out what the zero through six days which day *t*-1 is which yet###but, i didn't study it that hard###speakerb89.###speakera90.
8196:8	you probably don't want *t*-1 to take them *-2 to see silence of the lambs.	probably	###speakerb174.###i did, too.###speakera175.###i mean, it was just more for my money.###speakerb176.###yeah.###i didn't think 0 it was too long at all.###uh, he said 0 after about the first hour he started *-1 looking at his watch.###speakera177.###huh.###speakerb178.###the other one 0 you need *-1 to go *-2 see *t*-3 is * sleeping with the enemy.###speakera179.###uh-huh.###speakerb180.###and, how old are your kids *t*-1?###speakera181.###one is eight###and one is eleven.###speakerb182.
8340:27	and, um, as we did with probably ninety-five percent of the people here in dallas-fort worth we bought a fox and jacobs home,	probably	###that's interesting.###that was a good movie, too.###speakera233.###well, do you think 0 we covered baseball?###speakerb234.###i think so.###speakera235.###okay,###well, * have a good night.###speakera1.###okay.###i'll let you start first, okay?###speakerb2.###okay.### we, um, i'm presently living in a house, uh,###first time, uh,###we had the house built *-1###and so this is our, our fifth year in it i guess 0 *t*-1,###and, uh, um, it *exp*-2 was a real excitement * to, uh, to go out and select the house and have one made and built *-1 and like you wanted it,###we were the fourth *ich*-1 0 *t*-2 to build out of three hundred and forty houses.
8413:34	well, have you any plans * to, uh, maybe, uh, expand or move onward?	maybe	###speakera13.###but, uh, of course, my husband did everything except###my brother's a trim carpenter,###and he came in, you know, and did the inside for us,###and that helped.###speakerb14.###that was a big savings.###speakera15.###and, uh,###yes,###and, uh, we had *-1 to hire, of course, the plumbing and the brick and everything else,###nothing, you know,###he did everything else.###we've been in it six years.###speakerb16.###well, that's great.### w-, uh, have you been in it long?###speakera17.###speakerb18.###oh, really,
8418:20	and we had thought before maybe a lot older 0 we don't need such a large house that we'll sell it,	maybe	###speakerb14.###that was a big savings.###speakera15.###and, uh,###yes,###and, uh, we had *-1 to hire, of course, the plumbing and the brick and everything else,###nothing, you know,###he did everything else.###we've been in it six years.###speakerb16.###well, that's great.### w-, uh, have you been in it long?###speakera17.###speakerb18.###oh, really,###well, have you any plans * to, uh, maybe, uh, expand or move onward?###speakera19.### n-, no,###we're,###well, uh, our kids are kind of still small now,
8523:52	so, the thing is, is basically that i spend, like, maybe thirty-five, forty dollars every two weeks on, on groceries	maybe	###since i'm in school i don't, like, basically have a monthly budget because i'm living off my dad,###but the thing is, is that, um, i have *-1 to keep it under control because, for example, you know, it's like the, the beginning of the semester when you go *-2 to pay for everything *t*-3, everything is pretty rough,###but he controls that part###but, then whenever, you know,###it's like, once the semester starts i'm the one who *t*-1 has *-2 to control how much spending there is *t*-3.###and the only thing that i, i basically spend my money on *t*-1 is just food### and, um, so,###speakerb2.###what about tuition and rent?###who *t*-1 takes care of that?###speakera3.###well, the thing is, is that i live in a dorm.###speakerb4.###uh.###speakera5.###so, uh, what *t*-1 happens is 0 you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts.###speakerb6.###yeah.###speakera7.###and then the tuition is also the same thing.
8696:11	we're probably like most am-, american families,	probably	###speakera67.###oh, okay.###speakerb68.###and she gets paid *-1 for that###so she brings some money in.###speakera69.###yeah.###speakerb70.###she is trying *-1 to start he-, her own business where she does that *ich*-2 full time. alterations and sewing. stuff for the public *t*-3###speakera71.###okay.###speakerb72.###speakera73.###yeah.###speakerb74.###and, uh, * do that on a, on a full time basis here in town.###speakera75.### and so, and you have a monthly budget?###speakerb76.###well, s-, sort of.
8709:84	we've got a, several credit cards that sometimes, um, instead of *-1 paying *t*-2 them all off every month maybe you have *-1 to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around christmas time.	maybe	###yeah.###speakerb74.###and, uh, * do that on a, on a full time basis here in town.###speakera75.### and so, and you have a monthly budget?###speakerb76.###well, s-, sort of.###we're probably like most am-, american families,###i guess, that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we've got *t*-1 at the end of the month,###speakera77.###right.###speakerb78.###and we know what bills *t*-1 have *-2 to be paid *-3,###and, uh, we pay as many of those bills that *t*-1 can be paid *-2 with, with the monthly budget,###so.###speakera79.###so, you don't have any problem in, um, * overcharging on your credit card, and stuff like that.###speakerb80.###oh sure.###we're like everybody else, you know,
8787:22	and i spent around like, maybe, two hundred dollars.	maybe	###yeah.###speakerb102.###yeah.###speakera103.### and so, but the thing is, is, that, um.###speakerb104.###well, * especially being a college student yo-, your,###i don't know that you need *-1 to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving, you know,###speakera105.###yeah.###speakerb106.###that effects the budget especially around, uh, christmas time###at the end of the semester you've got finals and lots of bills i would suspect 0 *t*-1.###speakera107.###yeah.###speakerb108.###what about when you have breaks *t*-1 like, um, christmas or between sessions?###speakera109.###well, for example, we had spring break now,###and i went *-1 skiing
9019:5	maybe it was because it was too dry,	maybe	###speakera47.###i think 0 i had four, uh, jalapeno plants last year.###i think 0 one of them died,###but i, i've got, s-, i've put them, i chop them up and put them in jars and usually give them away because i, there is no way that i can eat all of those *t*-1###nobody else in the family likes them,###but * always got *-1 to the keep those planted.###speakerb48.###yeah,###oh, my husband doesn't like them either,###but i can always give them away.###speakera49.###well, that's kind of the way 0 i am *t*-1, um.###speakerb50.###besides they're fun 0 * to grow *t*-1.###speakera51.###i planted, uh, zucchini last year.###uh, i planted four hills of them.###i think 0 i had three or four seeds in each one of them,###and those things just flat took over.###um, it wasn't until late, i guess in the summer,
9086:82	uh, robert what do you, uh, think, what substances do you think 0 *t*-1 are the most, uh, likely causes of air pollution?	likely	###so whenever you feel comfortable about * concluding *t*-1, well, i'm,###that would be fine.###speakerb70.###oh, just any time.###speakera71.###well, all right.###i guess 0 we'll call this one quits### an, and thanks for * participating.###speakerb72.###all right.###well, i've enjoyed *-1 talking to you.###speakera73.###all right,###* have a good time.###speakerb74.###okay.###bye.###speakera75.###bye.###speakera1.
9169:10	uh, maybe just take good care of our cars, and make * sure 0 we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing.	maybe	###i never did see the full story,###so i don't know.###speakerb26.###yeah.###speakera27.###but they said that, that it really caused so much smog *ich*-2 over, uh, the grand canyon in the winter months that they couldn't do the, uh, piloting, uh, you know, the helicopter trips and that sort of thing. which *t*-1 would be horrible, because the, there's nothing,###speakerb28.###um.###speakera29.###speakerb30.###yeah.###speakera31.###i mean that's such a spectacle.###it *exp*-1 would be a shame * to ruin it.###speakerb32.###yeah.###speakera33.###uh, what do you think 0 individuals could do *t*-1, or society could do *t*-1 * to alleviate this problem.###speakerb34.###uh, i don't, uh, i don't know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals.
9182:32	but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can, uh, force, uh, government, uh, that we elect *t*-1 to deal more seriously with it.	certainly	###it *exp*-1 would be a shame * to ruin it.###speakerb32.###yeah.###speakera33.###uh, what do you think 0 individuals could do *t*-1, or society could do *t*-1 * to alleviate this problem.###speakerb34.###uh, i don't, uh, i don't know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals.###uh, maybe just take good care of our cars, and make * sure 0 we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing.###um,###speakera35.###right.###speakerb36.###apart from that, i, i don't know what we can do *t*-1 as individuals.###what do you think 0 we can do *t*-1?###speakera37.###uh-huh,###you think, 0 it's more, more to society.###well i guess 0 i kind of agree there.###i, uh,###on an individual basis there isn't a lot 0 we can do *t*-1 about a lot of things
9205:13	and that's probably how we ought *-2 to do it *t*-1. uh, individ-, *-2 being individually responsible as, uh, gro-, in order *-3 to be group responsible.	probably	###speakera39.###and i do think that we have a responsibility there.###i must admit 0 i'm not always real politically active###but i do think that, um, congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards.###speakerb40.###yeah.###speakera41.###and it's brought the,###they, uh, really listen to### the, the, uh, lobbyist and, uh, the car manufacturing companies have, uh, you know, have really pushed,###they,###all those re-, restrictions are really too hard,### we can't, we can't quite make that go###and they don't###and then we still live with air pollution.###speakerb42.###yeah.###speakera43.###um, so i suspect that that's one thing that, that as individuals, we can do *t*-1, * make our voices known, perhaps to our legislators.###but, um, as a society, i think 0 we can do more *t*-1
9212:32	and in the case of air pollution, it simply might turn out at some point down the road, *-1 to be so costly *ich*-4 *ich*-5 * to have *-3 to live with air pollution in terms of health problems, and everything else that we'll spend the money that *t*-6's necessary * to, uh, to get rid *-2 of the source of it.	might	###and it's brought the,###they, uh, really listen to### the, the, uh, lobbyist and, uh, the car manufacturing companies have, uh, you know, have really pushed,###they,###all those re-, restrictions are really too hard,### we can't, we can't quite make that go###and they don't###and then we still live with air pollution.###speakerb42.###yeah.###speakera43.###um, so i suspect that that's one thing that, that as individuals, we can do *t*-1, * make our voices known, perhaps to our legislators.###but, um, as a society, i think 0 we can do more *t*-1###and that's probably how we ought *-2 to do it *t*-1. uh, individ-, *-2 being individually responsible as, uh, gro-, in order *-3 to be group responsible.###speakerb44.###yeah,###i guess 0 i'm, i'm to the point where i'm cynical enough that i really don't believe 0 anything will happen unless, unless there's something economically justifiable about it *t*-1.###speakera45.###right.###speakerb46.
9218:7	and probably the only way 0 that can happen *t*-1 is for, um, governments to realize that they have *-2 to pay if companies don't.	probably	###and they don't###and then we still live with air pollution.###speakerb42.###yeah.###speakera43.###um, so i suspect that that's one thing that, that as individuals, we can do *t*-1, * make our voices known, perhaps to our legislators.###but, um, as a society, i think 0 we can do more *t*-1###and that's probably how we ought *-2 to do it *t*-1. uh, individ-, *-2 being individually responsible as, uh, gro-, in order *-3 to be group responsible.###speakerb44.###yeah,###i guess 0 i'm, i'm to the point where i'm cynical enough that i really don't believe 0 anything will happen unless, unless there's something economically justifiable about it *t*-1.###speakera45.###right.###speakerb46.###and in the case of air pollution, it simply might turn out at some point down the road, *-1 to be so costly *ich*-4 *ich*-5 * to have *-3 to live with air pollution in terms of health problems, and everything else that we'll spend the money that *t*-6's necessary * to, uh, to get rid *-2 of the source of it.###speakera47.###uh-huh.###speakerb48.###speakera49.###i suspect that the pub-, that there's going *-1 to have *-2 to be a lot of pressure, uh, come * to bear on the companies that *t*-4 deal with it
9240:13	uh, i probably wouldn't mind if it really came down to it.	probably	###yeah.###speakera51.###and, uh, i don't know how long that, that will take *t*-1.###speakerb52.###people also have *-1 to realize 0 they can't have their cake and eat it.###so, if you don't want *-1 to burn coal for power, how about nucle-, nuclear energy.###speakera53.###sure.###speakerb54.###well we don't want that either.###speakera55.###exactly,###yeah,###right.###speakerb56.###how about * investing in the sun.###well nobody wants *-1 to pay twenty-five cents a kilowatt hour, i don't think 0 *t*-2.###speakera57.###right.###speakerb58.
9256:13	however, it might have had other causes.	might	###well nobody wants *-1 to pay twenty-five cents a kilowatt hour, i don't think 0 *t*-2.###speakera57.###right.###speakerb58.###uh, i probably wouldn't mind if it really came down to it.###speakera59.###well it's just the same thing with the car, uh, uh, the gasoline,###now is a wonderful time 0 * to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline *t*-1, so that we don't, uh, run into the kind of problems 0 we recently had *t*-2###speakerb60.###oh yes,###yes,###yes.###speakera61.###and yet the government is not going *-1 to do that because people are too dependent###and they don't want, they don't want *-1 to pay for it.###so instead, we spend billions of dollars *-1 going to war.###speakerb62.###yes.###speakera63.###uh, you know, wha-,
9259:8	oh certainly,	certainly	###speakerb58.###uh, i probably wouldn't mind if it really came down to it.###speakera59.###well it's just the same thing with the car, uh, uh, the gasoline,###now is a wonderful time 0 * to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline *t*-1, so that we don't, uh, run into the kind of problems 0 we recently had *t*-2###speakerb60.###oh yes,###yes,###yes.###speakera61.###and yet the government is not going *-1 to do that because people are too dependent###and they don't want, they don't want *-1 to pay for it.###so instead, we spend billions of dollars *-1 going to war.###speakerb62.###yes.###speakera63.###uh, you know, wha-,###however, it might have had other causes.###certainly oil was a big factor.###speakerb64.
9262:28	um, and i think 0 that's probably going *-1 to happen with, with such things as air pollution,	probably	###well it's just the same thing with the car, uh, uh, the gasoline,###now is a wonderful time 0 * to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline *t*-1, so that we don't, uh, run into the kind of problems 0 we recently had *t*-2###speakerb60.###oh yes,###yes,###yes.###speakera61.###and yet the government is not going *-1 to do that because people are too dependent###and they don't want, they don't want *-1 to pay for it.###so instead, we spend billions of dollars *-1 going to war.###speakerb62.###yes.###speakera63.###uh, you know, wha-,###however, it might have had other causes.###certainly oil was a big factor.###speakerb64.###oh certainly,###yes.###speakera65.
9263:115	when we, when we se-, get serious about cleaning, about our motors in our automobiles *t*-2 then, uh, then maybe, you know, we'll have a little bit of help.	maybe	###now is a wonderful time 0 * to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline *t*-1, so that we don't, uh, run into the kind of problems 0 we recently had *t*-2###speakerb60.###oh yes,###yes,###yes.###speakera61.###and yet the government is not going *-1 to do that because people are too dependent###and they don't want, they don't want *-1 to pay for it.###so instead, we spend billions of dollars *-1 going to war.###speakerb62.###yes.###speakera63.###uh, you know, wha-,###however, it might have had other causes.###certainly oil was a big factor.###speakerb64.###oh certainly,###yes.###speakera65.###um, and i think 0 that's probably going *-1 to happen with, with such things as air pollution,
9287:7	and certainly we don't have the eye stinging variety that you get *t*-1 in the big cities.	certainly	###speakera67.###do you have any air pollution in your area?###speakerb68.###there's not really a lot here in raleigh.###uh, once in a while we'll get some, uh,###i think 0 it kind of washes down from, uh, from your area linda.###speakera69.###oh no.###speakerb70.### that's what they, that's what they,###speakera71.###you're talking about from, from the, uh, the middle, middle states, that, that *t*-1 have more factories and so on.###speakerb72.###yeah.###speakera73.###speakerb74.###yeah,###yeah,###that's what they say *t*-1###but it's it's not, it's not very usual
9307:24	well i suspect that we've probably covered everything that we need *-1 to *?* *t*-2 here.	probably	###and certainly we don't have the eye stinging variety that you get *t*-1 in the big cities.###speakera75.###yeah,###we really don't have that either.### although i think 0 i can tell a difference in,###i lived in this area for about twenty-five years###and i think 0 i can tell a difference in the comfort level, uh, particularly in the summer. uh, you know, when it gets hot *t*-1, and you have, the, that kind of a pressure from the pockets of air, uh, usually they say caused * by exhaust *t*-1.###speakerb76.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera77.###speakerb78.###yeah.###speakera79.###it seems to me that i'm more uncomfortable###and, you know, my eyes sting more and so on and so on.###so i suspect that it's, it's an ever growing problem.###speakerb80.###yeah.###speakera81.
9381:99	i mean, i'd, i would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly	possibly	###he's up in boston,###speakera17.###speakerb18.###and it was twenty-nine there###and it was, you know, in the seventies out here###and, it was really, uh,###speakera19.###yeah.###speakerb20.###he really wished 0 he could be here, rather than there.###speakera21.###yeah,###well, um, i don't know### i, i guess 0 i'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather.###speakerb22.###oh really.###speakera23.###um, i, i like it warmer,###i mean i like it, you know, i like it warm###but it doesn't really matter.
9478:76	i, i think, 0 in, in some, in some respects it probably mumblex more tolerable.	probably	###it's so hot, 0 you just feel it pulling away,###bizarre.###speakerb46.###oh wow, uh.###speakera47.###speakerb48.###i know 0 i, i tend * to, i tend *-1 to be able *-2 to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate *t*-3.###speakera49.###yeah.###speakerb50.###uh it doesn't,###some people say, uh, 0 they, they like *-1 to watch the changing of the seasons###but, uh, i'd rather, you know, like southern california, you know, have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time.###speakera51.###yeah.###speakerb52.###so, it's kind of a luxury.###speakera53.###i tend *-1 to agree###but, i don't know,
9481:97	well i guess 0 this, the weather isn't as lively a topic as, uh, as some of the others 0 we might have gotten *t*-1.	might	###oh wow, uh.###speakera47.###speakerb48.###i know 0 i, i tend * to, i tend *-1 to be able *-2 to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate *t*-3.###speakera49.###yeah.###speakerb50.###uh it doesn't,###some people say, uh, 0 they, they like *-1 to watch the changing of the seasons###but, uh, i'd rather, you know, like southern california, you know, have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time.###speakera51.###yeah.###speakerb52.###so, it's kind of a luxury.###speakera53.###i tend *-1 to agree###but, i don't know,### i, i think, 0 in, in some, in some respects it probably mumblex more tolerable.###speakerb54.###yeah,
9512:16	well, my favorite, probably, all time t v show is star trek.	probably	###speakera57.###well i mean i've had some pretty bad, i guess some pretty controversial topics###so it's just like well that was my fault.###but then the weather's like,###man, i mean, it gets pretty mundane,###i mean you can only talk about, about the situation just so long.###speakerb58.###yeah,###i know,###weather's just not all that inspiring.###okay,###well it *exp*-1's nice * talking to you.###speakera59.###okay.###speakerb60.###bye-bye.###speakera61.###bye.###speakera1.###okay,
9527:43	and i've, i've always liked that show probably the very best.	probably	###bye-bye.###speakera61.###bye.###speakera1.###okay,###well, my favorite, probably, all time t v show is star trek.###and i would mumblex it like that,### i, i like the adventure of it. and the idea that, that we would survive long enough *-1 to get to that point and be able *-2 to do these fantastic things in space.###speakerb2.###uh-huh.###speakera3.###speakerb4.###uh-huh.###speakera5.###and then i like the,###they have a new one now.###the star trek the next generation. which *t*-1 it's an all new cast, but kind of the same idea, * going out to new places and, and doing new things and finding out about different people,###speakerb6.###right.###speakera7.
9531:11	i'm certainly acquainted with the character the characters.	certainly	###okay,###well, my favorite, probably, all time t v show is star trek.###and i would mumblex it like that,### i, i like the adventure of it. and the idea that, that we would survive long enough *-1 to get to that point and be able *-2 to do these fantastic things in space.###speakerb2.###uh-huh.###speakera3.###speakerb4.###uh-huh.###speakera5.###and then i like the,###they have a new one now.###the star trek the next generation. which *t*-1 it's an all new cast, but kind of the same idea, * going out to new places and, and doing new things and finding out about different people,###speakerb6.###right.###speakera7.###and i've, i've always liked that show probably the very best.###speakerb8.###uh-huh.###i think 0 i've actually seen a number of star treks, one way or another over the years. uh, although i never watched it regularly.
9639:4	maybe it's in,	maybe	###yeah,###yeah.###speakera47.###because they're,###i guess 0 that, that, that falls mumblex,###and one of my other favorite shows is sesame street because of the kids.###i like that real well.###speakerb48.###right,###well, when my kids were little *t*-1, i did have a t v set###and i did watch a lot of sesame street and a lot of electric company, as well.###speakera49.###i don't think 0 they have that on anymore.###speakerb50.###well that would be a shame.###speakera51.###i haven't seen the electric company in a long time.### i, i remember it when i was younger *t*-1 of, you know, *-2 catching it on p b s,###but, uh, i don't think 0 they show,###it must be in,
9817:8	they probably didn't have a t v until i got *-1 to be, you know, grade school or so.	probably	###um.###speakerb104.###well, i don't know,###was there any,###i remember the milton berle show even,### i was, i was,###speakera105.###ye-,###i'm not old enough *-1 to recall that one.###speakerb106.###well i guess, 0 i have *-1 to admit that i am *?*.###speakera107.###my t v viewing started sort of mid-sixties,###so.###speakerb108.###i see.###speakera109.### my folks didn't, my folks,###i'm not even sure if we had one when i was really little *t*-1.###that may be why, bu-,
9835:5	maybe even more so.	maybe	###i'm not even sure if we had one when i was really little *t*-1.###that may be why, bu-,###they probably didn't have a t v until i got *-1 to be, you know, grade school or so.###speakerb110.###yeah.###speakera111.###and the shows that i like *t*-1 now, they wouldn't let me watch *t*-2.###i had *-1 to catch them all on repeats.###like star trek,###they thought 0 that was much too violent for small children.###so,###speakerb112.###huh.###speakera113.### i, i, i ended up *-1 watching a lot of these things on, you know, repeats in the afternoons or something.###speakerb114.###yeah.### that's, that's interesting.###uh, i think 0 it *exp*-1's interesting that parents think that their small children learn violence from tv,###people were just as violent before t v was invented *-1,
10120:8	we might actually get *-1 to go to a world series, huh.	might	###uh, they're a good ball team.###speakerb53.###that's right.###speakera54.###they really are *?*.###speakerb55.###they sure are *?*.###wouldn't it *exp*-1 be something * to have a world series between da-, the rangers and the astros.###speakera56.###oh, wouldn't it, wouldn't it *?* though.###speakerb57.###boy,###i tell you###that would draw a crowd, wouldn't it *?*.###speakera58.###wouldn't it *?*.###speakerb59.###it sure would *?*.###speakera60.###oh my goodness,

10370:11	he's probably been through all kinds of nightmares.	probably	###but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside,###so i put them outside once i got a house###and they're doing great out there,###they love it.###but the other one, the first one 0 i got *t*-1 he doesn't want anything 0 * to do *t*-2 with outside unless you're there.###speakerb32.###oh, uh-huh.###speakera33.###other than that he gets scared to death.###if you shut that door he goes into hiding.###speakerb34.###oh no.###speakera35.###i think 0 it's from the time 0 he jumped off the balcony *t*-1.###speakerb36.###yes,###uh-huh,###that's it.###speakera37.###and lord knows what *t*-1 happened to him.
10468:30	and you go crazy *-1 thinking 0 it might be yours.	might	###speakera65.###and it *exp*-1 worries me that one day one of them won't come back,###speakerb66.###yes.###speakera67.###and i feel like they need a big home, a nice place where someone can have the time 0 *-1 to play with them and things *t*-2 *t*-3.###but i can't give them up.###speakerb68.###oh no.###speakera69.### i just, i go hysterical when they don't come home *t*-1.###speakerb70.###right###and you worry about, oh, who *t*-1's taking care of them.###speakera71.###oh, oh yeah,###and every time 0 you see one hit * on the side of the road *t*-2 you say is that my cat.###speakerb72.###uh-huh.###speakera73.
10531:23	and he said 0 he was probably weaned *-1 *-4 too young, which he was *t*-2, because his mom was killed *-3,	probably	###oh, uh-huh.###speakera89.###and he was the last one 0 she carried *t*-1 across, you know,###the whole big sad story.###speakerb90.###oh.###speakera91.###so of course, i had *-1 to take him.###i felt so sorry for him after that.###speakerb92.###right,###right.###speakera93.###and he is, uh, you can tell 0 he was weaned *-1 *-2 too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers.###speakerb94.###oh no.###speakera95.###yeah,###he,###i asked the vet why he did that *t*-1
10699:8	oh definitely.	definitely	###and she,###well in fact i got her when i moved out of the house also *t*-1.###speakera149.###really.###speakerb150.###and so yeah,###it's, uh,###* wouldn't have,###i mean, oh, if something happens to her.###speakera151.###oh i know###it's like the end of the world.###speakerb152.###it will be *?*.###speakera153.###i know 0 that's how i am *t*-1 about xanadu.###speakerb154.###oh, goodness.###you get so attached to them.###speakera155.
10861:23	it, it might have one best picture, too.	might	###oh my.###speakera22.###and, uh, normally never the twain shall meet.###speakerb23.###you bet,###especially in the south.###speakera24.###yes,###right,###and, um, uh, it, it really was a fantastic movie.###the acting was phenomenal.###speakerb25.###well as, it, as i recall it got some academy awards, didn't it.###speakera26.###oh yes,###jessica tandy won best actress###and, uh,###speakerb27.###oh yeah,###that's right.
10928:48	wel-, because that's the way 0 they, they might seem *t*-1 outwardly,	might	###speakerb45.###that was hilarious.### the, the, i guess 0 the, the first, the first, uh, scene in that movie that *t*-1 really got my attention, uh, concerning the, the disease and all that was when he, uh, dropped the, the, uh, the toothpicks *t*-2,###speakera46.###oh yes.###speakerb47.###and he was able *-1 to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image.###speakera48.###yes,###yes.###speakerb49.###unbelievable.###speakera50.###well, you know there are people, uh, referred to * as savants also, uh, who *t*-1 can do most phenomenal things###speakerb51.###yeah.###speakera52.###and everyone feels 0 they are totally retarded.###speakerb53.###yeah,
10943:90	and, and, and you need *-1 to, to work with it, uh, you know, certainly on, on a daily basis but then ag-, then again work with it toward a good end. not, not toward * winning in las vegas, for example.	certainly	###yeah.###speakera52.###and everyone feels 0 they are totally retarded.###speakerb53.###yeah,###wel-, because that's the way 0 they, they might seem *t*-1 outwardly,###speakera54.###that's right.###speakerb55.###but, boy there's a lots going on in there.###speakera56.###it's amazing.###speakerb57.###yeah,###yeah###and i, the, the, i think 0 the, the best thing about rainman was the, uh, the way that they put together the, the real awfulness of the, of the, of the disease, only *t*-1,###speakera58.###yes.###speakerb59.### an, and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it, you know,
10994:16	i mean he certainly didn't,	certainly	###that was neat.###speakera70.###uh-huh.###well that's tremendous,### that, it's good because it does make you think, about your own family.###speakerb71.###yeah,###a lot.###speakera72.###and see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother.###speakerb73.###uh-huh.###no question,### he, the, he was, he's one of these guys *ich*-4 though that *t*-1 doesn't really like *-2 to go *-3 see movies like that.###he likes the * bang them up and shoot them up things.###speakera74.###uh-huh.###speakerb75.### and, and, uh, it, it *exp*-1 was like * pulling teeth * to go *-3 get him to, to see it###but, uh, oh boy. he was, uh, uh, he, he gave the, the best response that i've heard him give *t*-1 of this type of movie for rain man.
11344:13	you might, you don't have *-1 to pay them a lot.	might	###uh-huh.###speakerb102.###but ours are real hard 0 * to find *t*-1.###that's the one thing that *t*-1 really discourages me.### i saved pa-, you know, i recycle paper,###but they,###it's almost like they don't want the paper, because they don't pay, at all,###speakera103.###speakerb104.###i mean, they're real hard 0 * to find *t*-2 the places that *t*-1 pay.###and that's really discouraging.###i mean, i just go ahead and take it to the, the regular place, where it's, you know, they just accept it *t*-1.###speakera105.###uh-huh.###speakerb106.###but they, uh, i think 0 they should *?*###yeah,###if they want people to recycle i think 0 *t*-1 it's, uh, you know,###like the aluminum, you know,###it gets people to, uh, *-1 doing it, you know,
11359:5	maybe there's two for aluminum.	maybe	###but they, uh, i think 0 they should *?*###yeah,###if they want people to recycle i think 0 *t*-1 it's, uh, you know,###like the aluminum, you know,###it gets people to, uh, *-1 doing it, you know,### you might, you don't have *-1 to pay them a lot.###speakera107.###yeah,###i live near a walmart###and there's a big, uh, uh, huge dumpster looking thing sitting out front,###in fact i think 0 there's two of them, that *t*-1 have several openings,###speakerb108.###uh-huh.###speakera109.###and it's for recycling###and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category,###speakerb110.###uh-huh.###speakera111.###i don't,
11385:12	so, it probably is a hassle.	probably	###yeah.###speakerb114.###i,###the one thing 0 i don't like *t*-1 about the newspaper also is, uh,###like at work we have two different trash cans at your desk.###you have one for paper and one for just your normal trash,###speakera115.###uh-huh.###speakerb116.###but in, uh, in the paper one you have *-1 to separate.###you have *-1 to make * sure 0 you don't throw away any of the slick paper, like magazines.###speakera117.###uh-huh.###speakerb118.###you can't throw any of that away###and you can't throw certain file type things away,###and i just think 0 it's such a hassle,###it seems like it would be, it *exp*-1 would be easy * to take it all,###i don't know,###of course, i don't know all that about recycling
11793:29	i mean, while it *exp*-1's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories, uh, pollute a lot, uh, if you look at how much pollution *t*-2 is say kicked *-3 up by an active volcano, uh, it *exp*-4's certainly less than clear that anything 0 man can do *t*-5 in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all.	certainly	###speakerb17.###yeah,###well it wasn't the matter of wealth,###it was the matter that they were not wealthy, that *t*-1 made them equal.###speakera18.###yes.###speakerb19.###well, i'll talk to you later,###speakera20.###all right.###* thank you.###bye, bye.###speakerb21.###okay.###bye-bye.###speakera1.###okay, uh,###could you tell me what you think 0 *t*-1 contributes most to, uh, air pollution?###speakerb2.###well, it's hard 0 * to say *t*-1.

11798:15	i think 0 probably the greatest cause is, uh, vehicles, especially around cities.	probably	###yes.###speakerb19.###well, i'll talk to you later,###speakera20.###all right.###* thank you.###bye, bye.###speakerb21.###okay.###bye-bye.###speakera1.###okay, uh,###could you tell me what you think 0 *t*-1 contributes most to, uh, air pollution?###speakerb2.###well, it's hard 0 * to say *t*-1.###i mean, while it *exp*-1's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories, uh, pollute a lot, uh, if you look at how much pollution *t*-2 is say kicked *-3 up by an active volcano, uh, it *exp*-4's certainly less than clear that anything 0 man can do *t*-5 in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all.###what do you think *t*-1?###speakera3.###um, well, you talked about, uh, volcanos.###i'm not sure how many active volcanos there are *t*-1 now, and, and what the amount of material that they do, uh, put *t*-2 into the atmosphere.
11806:10	but i certainly work near a city.	certainly	###okay.###bye-bye.###speakera1.###okay, uh,###could you tell me what you think 0 *t*-1 contributes most to, uh, air pollution?###speakerb2.###well, it's hard 0 * to say *t*-1.###i mean, while it *exp*-1's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories, uh, pollute a lot, uh, if you look at how much pollution *t*-2 is say kicked *-3 up by an active volcano, uh, it *exp*-4's certainly less than clear that anything 0 man can do *t*-5 in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all.###what do you think *t*-1?###speakera3.###um, well, you talked about, uh, volcanos.###i'm not sure how many active volcanos there are *t*-1 now, and, and what the amount of material that they do, uh, put *t*-2 into the atmosphere.###i think 0 probably the greatest cause is, uh, vehicles, especially around cities.###speakerb4.###uh-huh.###speakera5.###um, uh, do you live right in the city itself?###speakerb6.###no,###i'm more out in the suburbs,
11835:36	and, uh, i've noticed over the past say, maybe five or six years, uh,	maybe	###speakerb10.###uh-huh.###speakera11.###it's mainly farms and, uh, no heavy industry.###attleboro, itself,###i live in rhode island.###speakerb12.###oh, i see.###speakera13.###and, it's in the north,###i live up in the, uh, northeast corner###and attleboro sits in just over the line, where t i's plant is *t*-1,###speakerb14.###uh-huh.###speakera15.###but there isn't a lot of heavy industry.###there's the freeways###and we get an occasional,###it depends which way the wind's blowing *t*-1 from boston, cause we're like forty miles south of boston,###so we'll pick up that.
12086:5	maybe you, you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe	maybe	###the, uh, united states and canada are i guess, is, is, going into, uh, some types of agreements * to limit, uh, what *t*-1's being given *-2 out by power plants,###speakerb102.###uh-huh.###speakera103.###i guess 0 canada's quite concerned that we're sending a lot of our stuff up there,###speakerb104.###yeah,###sure.###speakera105.###so that's helping.###speakerb106.###well, what do you think *t*-1 about like a device, a meter right on a tail pipe###and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted *t*-1?###speakera107.###now that's an idea.###* don't say that too loud though because, uh, every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating generating revenue,###speakerb108.###well, it just means 0 if you don't pollute, right, or you pollute very little you don't have *-1 to pay any tax###or you just buy one of these things###and it, it, uh,
12086:29	maybe you, you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe	probably	###the, uh, united states and canada are i guess, is, is, going into, uh, some types of agreements * to limit, uh, what *t*-1's being given *-2 out by power plants,###speakerb102.###uh-huh.###speakera103.###i guess 0 canada's quite concerned that we're sending a lot of our stuff up there,###speakerb104.###yeah,###sure.###speakera105.###so that's helping.###speakerb106.###well, what do you think *t*-1 about like a device, a meter right on a tail pipe###and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted *t*-1?###speakera107.###now that's an idea.###* don't say that too loud though because, uh, every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating generating revenue,###speakerb108.###well, it just means 0 if you don't pollute, right, or you pollute very little you don't have *-1 to pay any tax###or you just buy one of these things###and it, it, uh,
12097:10	so you probably would have *-1 to build it right into the muffler or something.	probably	###well, what do you think *t*-1 about like a device, a meter right on a tail pipe###and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted *t*-1?###speakera107.###now that's an idea.###* don't say that too loud though because, uh, every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating generating revenue,###speakerb108.###well, it just means 0 if you don't pollute, right, or you pollute very little you don't have *-1 to pay any tax###or you just buy one of these things###and it, it, uh,###maybe you, you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe###and, uh, the less 0 you pollute *t*-1 the longer the devise lasts *t*-2###and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe###and you couldn't start your car anymore.###speakera109.### that's a, that's an interesting concept.###is that your idea?###speakerb110.###yeah,###but, uh, you know, it's, uh,###i guess 0 the difficulty would be * to, that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again
12150:13	well you might, uh, generate some yeah, you might generate some interest in it.	might	###if you could come up with a device that's the thing.###speakerb124.###right.###speakera125.###but it *exp*-1 shouldn't be too hard * to do something like that.###but that's a, that's a thought.###no,###speakerb126.###uh-huh.###speakera127.###you're right###and that will solve, uh, a lot of problems.###i don't know if you, uh, if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on *-1 installing something like that.###speakerb128.###uh-huh.###speakera129.###uh, but you know a proposal to, uh, uh, i guess the proper authorities,###speakerb130.###uh-huh.###speakera131.
12150:41	well you might, uh, generate some yeah, you might generate some interest in it.	might	###if you could come up with a device that's the thing.###speakerb124.###right.###speakera125.###but it *exp*-1 shouldn't be too hard * to do something like that.###but that's a, that's a thought.###no,###speakerb126.###uh-huh.###speakera127.###you're right###and that will solve, uh, a lot of problems.###i don't know if you, uh, if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on *-1 installing something like that.###speakerb128.###uh-huh.###speakera129.###uh, but you know a proposal to, uh, uh, i guess the proper authorities,###speakerb130.###uh-huh.###speakera131.
12365:11	i'd certainly, uh,	certainly	###right.###speakerb6.###and this time president bush did it through action###and he, he drove policy by the course 0 he took *t*-1 and almost forced public support,###speakera7.###um.###speakerb8.###speakera9.###yes.###speakerb10.###or, uh, i mean, he left almost no alternative.###speakera11.###that's right.###speakerb12.### and, and it *ich*-2 was very interesting how he did it *t*-1###and, uh, i mean, i'm, i'm an air force officer,###so it, uh, it was interesting for me, uh, you know,###speakera13.###really.###speakerb14.
12392:125	but i, i would imagine that because of the, how close the, the vote was *t*-1 i'm, uh, i mean * almost certainly would have *-2 to be *?*.	certainly	###but other engi-, guys here on base,###this is a b fifty-two base where i work *t*-1,###so, we had about a thousand people *ich*-2 gone * from the base that *t*-1 went over there###speakera17.###yeah.###speakerb18.###and they're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it.###speakera19.###that's great, um,### if, if you remember, the vote in the congress 0 * to authorize war *t*-1, if necessary, was actually pretty close.###speakerb20.###yes###it was *?*.###speakera21.###and if, if my memory serves me right, i believe 0 a majority of democrats may even have opposed it,### it, it was,###speakerb22.###yeah,###i'm,###i don't know the exact figure
12442:46	well, had, had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor.	probably	###but still, we were really, highly concerned about it###speakera33.###i think so too.###speakerb34.###and, that we were worried that they were getting dug in###and, uh.###speakera35.###well they were,###speakerb36.###yeah.###speakera37.###and in fact they were so well dug in that, uh, when we sent our tanks around behind them *t*-2 they couldn't get turned *-1 around in time.###speakerb38.###right,### they couldn't, yeah they couldn't,###yeah,###it's true###they,###saddam thought 0 he had the whole thing, uh, figured *-3 out to, to which way we were coming *t*-2 and which, what, what our doctrine was *t*-1 that, uh,###speakera39.
12492:11	i'd certainly, uh, support israel in, in their, their policy that in * defending themselves and in, uh, in their handling of their foreign policy,	certainly	###right,### in, in fact, when he was governor of new hampshire *t*-1, i believe 0 *t*-2.###speakerb50.###yeah,###new hampshire.###speakera51.###okay.###i believe 0 he was the only one of fifty governors that *t*-1 voted against some kind of resolution of support for israel a few years back.###speakerb52.###oh my gosh.###speakera53.###and, uh, now he is a conservative,###but he is not a conservative that *t*-1 favors israel,###speakerb54.###uh.###speakera55.###and that, that concerns me greatly.###speakerb56.###well, i don't,###yeah,
12566:25	i guess, uh, well 0 maybe the computer will pair us up together another time.	maybe	###speakera69.###yeah.###speakerb70.###speakera71.###exactly,###exactly.###speakerb72.###and that, i mean that's never happened before,###speakera73.###no.###speakerb74.###and i don't know if it will ever happen again###but,###speakera75.###* may not *?*.###well it's been fun,###i enjo-, enjoyed *-1 talking with you.###speakerb76.###yeah,###okay, uh,
12962:15	i guess 0 probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is, uh, probably eddy arnold.	probably	###speakerb155.###oh, i, i've never cared for hank, williams, junior.###speakera156.###i never have *?* either,###speakerb157.###speakera158.###and i never have figured out how he won, uh, entertainer of the year for about, three or four years in a row *t*-1.###speakerb159.###oh.###speakera160.###speakerb161.###oh, we, we watch those award shows too,###we enjoy *-1 watching the country and the grammies and stuff###but i just, i just don't care for him,###speakera162.###yeah.###speakerb163.###i just never have *?*.###i don't,###speakera164.
12962:50	i guess 0 probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is, uh, probably eddy arnold.	probably	###speakerb155.###oh, i, i've never cared for hank, williams, junior.###speakera156.###i never have *?* either,###speakerb157.###speakera158.###and i never have figured out how he won, uh, entertainer of the year for about, three or four years in a row *t*-1.###speakerb159.###oh.###speakera160.###speakerb161.###oh, we, we watch those award shows too,###we enjoy *-1 watching the country and the grammies and stuff###but i just, i just don't care for him,###speakera162.###yeah.###speakerb163.###i just never have *?*.###i don't,###speakera164.
13194:15	i think 0 probably as soon as they finished high school it would be ideal, because a lot of times, i-, if they go straight into college i think 0 they're going in too quick	probably	###speakerb2.###uh, i think that, uh, really it *exp*-1 wouldn't hurt most of the young people of the country * to have * to go and do voluntary service.###uh, and, you know, i mean, there have been so many people that *t*-1 have done it###speakera3.###mumblex.###speakerb4.###and i've talked with several###and i think 0 they've gotten a lot out of it.###speakera5.###well, are you doing any kind of volunteer work now?###speakerb6.###not right now,###but i have done, uh, red clo-, cross work###and, uh, i've taught c p r training###a-,###speakera7.###what about,### when, when would people do it *t*-1,###when they finished high school *t*-1?###speakerb8.
13325:42	*-1 being a professional and, of course, you probably belong to one or more professional organizations,	probably	###speakera5.###uh-huh.###speakerb6.###speakera7.###uh-huh.###speakerb8.###speakera9.###that's true.###i didn't think about that.###speakerb10.###and, uh, of course flying, uh, * using your social security number, of course, permits people to do that###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###and almost anything 0 you do *t*-1 now, a social security number is required *-2.###speakera13.###uh-huh.###speakerb14.###and, uh, of course there's another aspect of this, too, uh, in terms of invasion of privacy###i just thought about it,
13435:29	and i'm just assuming 0 it's probably a salesman that *t*-1 called during the day	probably	###speakera51.###right.###speakerb52.###and, uh, i think 0 those two things bother me more than anything else as far as an invasion of privacy.###speakera53.###yeah.###speakerb54.###and, uh, i can't really think of anything else *ich*-1 offhand, that, uh,###speakera55.###i think 0 i dislike the phone number part the worst.###i mean, it's, it *exp*-1's one thing * to get junk mail because you can, you can just put it right in the trash,###but it's the phone calls,###and, you know, usually when they call you *t*-1, it's going *-2 to be when you s-, right when you sit down to dinner *t*-3 because they know, they pretty much know that you're at work all day###and they call you right when, when you've just gotten home from work *t*-1.###the last thing 0 you want *t*-1 is a phone call unless it's, you know, something halfway enjoyable,###but if it's a salesperson, it's just something 0 you don't want *-2 to have *-3 to mess with *t*-1.### and, and i've gotten a lot of them lately,###or i'll,###sometimes i come home from work###and there's a lot of hang ups on my answering machine
13437:13	and they'll probably call me up and, you know, call me back and bother me when i sit down to dinner later on *t*-1,	probably	###speakerb52.###and, uh, i think 0 those two things bother me more than anything else as far as an invasion of privacy.###speakera53.###yeah.###speakerb54.###and, uh, i can't really think of anything else *ich*-1 offhand, that, uh,###speakera55.###i think 0 i dislike the phone number part the worst.###i mean, it's, it *exp*-1's one thing * to get junk mail because you can, you can just put it right in the trash,###but it's the phone calls,###and, you know, usually when they call you *t*-1, it's going *-2 to be when you s-, right when you sit down to dinner *t*-3 because they know, they pretty much know that you're at work all day###and they call you right when, when you've just gotten home from work *t*-1.###the last thing 0 you want *t*-1 is a phone call unless it's, you know, something halfway enjoyable,###but if it's a salesperson, it's just something 0 you don't want *-2 to have *-3 to mess with *t*-1.### and, and i've gotten a lot of them lately,###or i'll,###sometimes i come home from work###and there's a lot of hang ups on my answering machine###and i'm just assuming 0 it's probably a salesman that *t*-1 called during the day###and, i wasn't home,
13473:8	i might get an important phone call,	might	###even if friends call it irritates me.###speakera63.###uh-huh.###speakerb64.###speakera65.###yeah.###speakerb66.###so i try *-1 to,###i actually during that period of time from, you know, usually from six o'clock or six thirty, whenever i get home *t*-1, until eight or so, i will shut off the phone###speakera67.###uh-huh.###speakerb68.###and, uh, my daughter gets irate, when i, when i do that *t*-1 because, you know, she's a teenager###speakera69.###uh-huh.###speakerb70.###speakera71.###uh, oh.###speakerb72.###so she'll, you know, why are you cutting off the phone *t*-1,
13546:16	well, yours is probably the same as ours.	probably	###speakera91.###right.###speakerb92.### and, uh, or i will just let the phone ring three or four times and know that it will forward to, uh, to the office.###speakera93.###uh-huh.###speakerb94.###and so it's, you know, it makes it convenient.###but at the office when i, you know,### we can, uh, on our system, and i imagine on most systems you can just route it directly to the answering service.###speakera95.###yeah.###ours is that way, too.###speakerb96.###and when i, when i want *-1 to be, you know, not bothered *-4 during the day *t*-3, that's exactly what i do *t*-2.###speakera97.###uh-huh.###speakerb98.###and so, uh,###speakera99.
13605:31	oh, dana, i think 0 we have probably conversed long enough.	probably	###yeah,###g t e purchased tigon.###speakera115.###okay.###speakerb116.###and so, we had, had been using a, the aspen service before they purchased tigon###speakera117.###uh-huh.###speakerb118.###so i imagine 0 we will be, uh, shifting over to that service uh, for a while, or if, in a while. as soon as we determine what we're going *-1 to do *t*-2 with contel after we bought contel.###speakera119.###uh-huh.###speakerb120.###speakera121.###uh-huh.###speakerb122.###speakera123.###oh, no.###speakerb124.###yeah.
13710:81	* to be, you know, * not to be crass about it, but, uh, uh, whether one might conceive, no pun intended, of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate, uh, uh a professional mother, a-, person. for instance, that,	might	###speakera25.###yeah.###speakerb26.###they were able *-1 to be home together.###uh, and we never actually experienced that.### what, in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and the potential changes over the, the next generation or so, i guess 0 i anticipate, uh, an increasing equality, uh, greater presence of women in management roles###speakera27.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakerb28.###uh, i don't know whether there will be an increased amount of, of surrogacy that we see *t*-1.###i just don't know.###speakera29.###what do you mean *t*-1?###speakerb30.###uh, deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother.###speakera31.###oh, yeah.###speakerb32.###sort of rent-a-mom,
13710:116	* to be, you know, * not to be crass about it, but, uh, uh, whether one might conceive, no pun intended, of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate, uh, uh a professional mother, a-, person. for instance, that,	might	###speakera25.###yeah.###speakerb26.###they were able *-1 to be home together.###uh, and we never actually experienced that.### what, in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and the potential changes over the, the next generation or so, i guess 0 i anticipate, uh, an increasing equality, uh, greater presence of women in management roles###speakera27.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakerb28.###uh, i don't know whether there will be an increased amount of, of surrogacy that we see *t*-1.###i just don't know.###speakera29.###what do you mean *t*-1?###speakerb30.###uh, deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother.###speakera31.###oh, yeah.###speakerb32.###sort of rent-a-mom,
13759:187	uh, i know that there are young people, characterized *, i guess as * being half my age, so that by definition that means, 0 they're young. uh, that, in my work place, who *t*-3 are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably *-4 would consider *-5 paying a woman, uh, eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year *-1 to take care of their child,	probably	###speakera47.###uh-huh.###speakerb48.###uh, i don't have boys,###that doesn't, didn't bother me,###* never has *?*.###* vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or, or as a professional nanny, nanny as you put it, uh.###speakera49.###yeah.###speakerb50.###maybe we'll see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of, say, *-1 taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care *t*-2.###speakera51.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakerb52.###it would be a sort of day care,###but it would be more of a family setting.###speakera53.###right.###speakerb54.
13789:13	and then you might have more control over, uh, the, the morals that they would be taught *-1 *t*-2 rather than in like a classroom or a day care center.	might	###speakera59.###* to come in and live with them?###speakerb60.###or * to put their child into a s-, into a home setting, where they would, you know, like they, they would get, leave at eight in the morning and, and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew 0 there were going *-1 to be four other kids *t*-2 *t*-3###speakera61.###uh-huh.###speakerb62.### and, and you were paying for really high quality care.###speakera63.###yeah.###speakerb64.###speakera65.###right.###speakerb66.###uh, i have acquaintances of mine where i know that they are paying figures on, on the order of what i quoted *t*-1 to someone, because that's what the experience 0 they want *t*-2 *t*-3###and i would imagine 0 if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that, that's a possibility of a change that we could see *t*-1 in the next few years.###speakera67.###uh-huh.###speakerb68.###speakera69.
13854:12	uh, and maybe that's a change 0 we'll see *t*-1.	maybe	###speakerb88.###mumblex.###speakera89.###speakerb90.### i'm, i'm noticing that, too,### and, and i notice the, the, a terming *ich*-1 ex-, em-, emerging called * solo parents, that i'm very aware of the number of solo mothers that, that i encounter *t*-2 in the work place,###speakera91.###yeah.###speakerb92.###and that, that is a little troublesome. uh, because the pressures on them are, are, rather, rather formidable.###speakera93.###yeah,###yeah.###speakerb94.###speakera95.###it's awful.###speakerb96.###speakera97.###yeah.###speakerb98.
13999:36	and, uh, hopefully, we'll have other good topic maybe another call someday,	maybe	###but i think, 0 we ought *-1 to start right here at home.###speakerb35.###speakera36.###i'm, you know,###speakerb37.###yeah,###uh, i'm not, i'm not so sure that overseas help, * helping overseas would be such a hot idea for, for, uh, a lot of young k-, people.###speakera38.###no,### it, it,###speakerb39.###but, since there is much that *t*-1 needs *-2 to be done *-3 here.###speakera40.### i think that, yeah, i think that we need *-1 to really address what we've done *t*-2 here### and, and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that *t*-1 gives them much broader outlook.###speakerb41.###uh-huh.###speakera42.###well, it's been really good.###we talked about this for a few minutes,
14061:67	and * a-, as expensive as they are *?* 0 * to produce *t*-1, they certainly don't want any dead airspace.	certainly	### and, and how do you rate the, uh,### h-, are you pleased with the news coverage that you're receiving *t*-1?###speakera7.### for, for local news i think 0 we do real well where it's,###we live in a kind of small town,###but i think 0 we get excellent local coverage, um,###and i like the national news that we see *t*-1,### we, we watch n b c###and i think 0 they do a real good job.###so, i'm, i've been real pleased with the quality of the news 0 we get *t*-1,###how about you?###speakerb8.###on the whole, i'm pleased when i have an opportunity * to hear just the facts *t*-1.###i would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves. um, since i don't necessarily agree with it or it tends *-1 to be extraordinarily trite.###speakera9.###right.###speakerb10.###uh, i think 0 i'm fed up with trite.###there seems *-1 to be more and more of it,###and i understand the void that, uh, *t*-1 comes naturally with both radio presentations and television presentations
14071:47	i, wo-, i, we're certainly in agreement there.	certainly	###how about you?###speakerb8.###on the whole, i'm pleased when i have an opportunity * to hear just the facts *t*-1.###i would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves. um, since i don't necessarily agree with it or it tends *-1 to be extraordinarily trite.###speakera9.###right.###speakerb10.###uh, i think 0 i'm fed up with trite.###there seems *-1 to be more and more of it,###and i understand the void that, uh, *t*-1 comes naturally with both radio presentations and television presentations###and * a-, as expensive as they are *?* 0 * to produce *t*-1, they certainly don't want any dead airspace.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###speakera13.###yeah,###but i think 0 there's enough news *ich*-1 out there that they could pass on more factual information to us,###and like you said, * save the commentaries because i'm going *-1 to listen to the, the news and draw my own opinions.###i don't really need their help *-1 to do that.###speakerb14.
14076:21	they're, maybe they're a little more efficient, or have more 0 * to do *t*-1 over that same time frame.	maybe	###right.###speakerb10.###uh, i think 0 i'm fed up with trite.###there seems *-1 to be more and more of it,###and i understand the void that, uh, *t*-1 comes naturally with both radio presentations and television presentations###and * a-, as expensive as they are *?* 0 * to produce *t*-1, they certainly don't want any dead airspace.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###speakera13.###yeah,###but i think 0 there's enough news *ich*-1 out there that they could pass on more factual information to us,###and like you said, * save the commentaries because i'm going *-1 to listen to the, the news and draw my own opinions.###i don't really need their help *-1 to do that.###speakerb14.### i, wo-, i, we're certainly in agreement there.###speakera15.###i don't think 0 radio is as bad *-1 to do that as t v is *?*.###speakerb16.###radio seems *-3 to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need *-1 to get *t*-2 done.

14166:87	i wondered if it would help 0 you sometimes fill in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that other people, people like myself might not pick up on *t*-1.	might	###right.###what did you think *t*-1 of the news coverage of the war?###speakerb42.###well, i almost felt like it was too much.###indeed, i found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day, one in the morning and one in the evening.###speakera43.###uh-huh.###speakerb44.###uh, i-, i spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst,###speakera45.###really?###speakerb46.###and i don't need their fill-ins, you know.###speakera47.###did that help you understand a lot what *t*-1 was going on### your, your prior experience with the military did,###speakerb48.###yes,###but i, i think 0 it helps me everyday in *-1 trying *-2 to review wh-, the state that the world is in *t*-3 and try *-2 to guess where we're going *t*-4.###speakera49.
14168:50	well, i, i think, uh, 0 my background is probably what *t*-1 absolutely turned me off with sixty minutes.	probably	###speakerb42.###well, i almost felt like it was too much.###indeed, i found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day, one in the morning and one in the evening.###speakera43.###uh-huh.###speakerb44.###uh, i-, i spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst,###speakera45.###really?###speakerb46.###and i don't need their fill-ins, you know.###speakera47.###did that help you understand a lot what *t*-1 was going on### your, your prior experience with the military did,###speakerb48.###yes,###but i, i think 0 it helps me everyday in *-1 trying *-2 to review wh-, the state that the world is in *t*-3 and try *-2 to guess where we're going *t*-4.###speakera49.###i wondered if it would help 0 you sometimes fill in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that other people, people like myself might not pick up on *t*-1.###speakerb50.
14194:16	and there's maybe a page of that, little brief paragraphs, unless that was one of their, the focus of their main stories.	maybe	###i like u s news and world report.###at one time or another i've taken them all for a year.###speakera53.###uh-huh.###speakerb54.###i believe in *-1 giving anything a chance.###speakera55.###sure.###speakerb56.###uh, but i keep coming back to that one,###so, i, that's kind of my favorite.###speakera57.###does that give a pretty good overview of everything###or like, does it give, um, i guess, little encapsulated reports and, and then a few big stories?###speakerb58.###it's primarily, um, a few big stories and then lots of high-level reports.###speakera59.###yeah.###speakerb60.###uh, here's *t*-2 what *t*-1 went on in asia over the past week,
14255:5	maybe our phone company out here will get around to, *-1 offering something like that.	maybe	###yeah,###and the other thing 0 we have *t*-1 that i like *-2 to check *t*-3 sometimes is, um, talking fingers,###do you have that?###speakerb74.###no.###speakera75.###you have different telephone numbers that you can dial *t*-1,###and then you dial in an access code###and it will, depending on what topic you called in *-1 to hear about *t*-2 whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update, it will give you, um, updated information.###so, that can give you, you know, current news updates, current weather updates, things like that###and it's, it's offered *-1 through the local phone company *-1 free of charge.###so, that's, an interesting alternative *ich*-3 occasionally that i like *-1 to use *t*-2.###speakerb76.###huh.###speakera77.###speakerb78.###well, it does sound very interesting,###speakera79.### it, it really is, yeah, it really is nice, i mean, because it gives you a wide variety of things 0 you can call and talk, and find out about *t*-1.###speakerb80.
14259:27	so, that is something 0 you might keep your eyes open for *t*-1,	might	###no.###speakera75.###you have different telephone numbers that you can dial *t*-1,###and then you dial in an access code###and it will, depending on what topic you called in *-1 to hear about *t*-2 whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update, it will give you, um, updated information.###so, that can give you, you know, current news updates, current weather updates, things like that###and it's, it's offered *-1 through the local phone company *-1 free of charge.###so, that's, an interesting alternative *ich*-3 occasionally that i like *-1 to use *t*-2.###speakerb76.###huh.###speakera77.###speakerb78.###well, it does sound very interesting,###speakera79.### it, it really is, yeah, it really is nice, i mean, because it gives you a wide variety of things 0 you can call and talk, and find out about *t*-1.###speakerb80.###maybe our phone company out here will get around to, *-1 offering something like that.###speakera81.###speakerb82.###speakera83.
14404:20	i think 0 the cowboys probably have a, a better team.	probably	###speakerb42.###yeah,###i guess 0 you can,###speakera43.###except i think 0 the cowboys are on the upswing.###i don't know about the vikings.###speakerb44.###yeah.###speakera45.###* just hadn't heard much about them lately.###speakerb46.###and the cardinals were kind of like the cowb-,###in fact they were doing better than the cowboys,###and the cowboy, cowboys came on strong at the end of the season,###and the cardinals got killed *-1 by the cowboys,###so.###speakera47.###yeah.###well, the cardinals,###i don't know.
14456:5	maybe i'll call you back after, after the recording is finished *-1.	maybe	###yeah###i think 0 it was *?*.###speakera55.### i think 0 it, i think 0 it was his shoulder 0 he had surgery on *t*-1.###but anyway, they're trying *-1 to keep him, you know, keep him, uh, from *-2 reinjuring anything,###but anyway.###speakerb56.###but, uh, well i got my thirty day notice yesterday.###speakera57.###thirty day notice for what?###speakerb58.###um, i'm done, where i work *t*-1.###speakera59.###oh, really.###speakerb60.###so, anyway, i guess 0 we can't talk much more about that,###but i just thought 0 i'd throw that in there.###speakera61.###what.###oh, okay,
14523:15	i guess 0 probably since about eighty-four, about eighty-five was when they started *-1 kind of going downhill really *t*-2,	probably	###since they've been to phoenix they haven't been, uh, all that impressive, i guess 0 *t*-1.###i guess 0 i've always been a cowboy fan.###other than that, i mean, you know, when i've, you know, when you grow up in a city that *t*-1 has the, you know, one of the greatest football teams until the last few years *t*-2, you kind of tend *-3 to get caught *-4 up in it.###speakerb78.###yeah,###well, the cowboys were th-, america's football team,###speakera79.###yeah.###speakerb80.###there's no question about that,###so.###speakera81.###yeah,###i mean it, it *exp*-1 was really exciting, * growing up when, when the cowboys were really big *t*-2.###speakerb82.###speakera83.###because my parents would always have season tickets,###and they'd go to all the games,###and you know, the hype were just unbelievable.###it's just, you know, the last, oh
14575:7	so maybe this year mumblex.	maybe	###so now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year.###speakera89.###um, you know, i'm not sure,###i'm not positive,### i didn't, i didn't really think about that.###i just remember *-1 trying *-2 to figure out where you could get###that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper.###but, not that i'll ever go.###i hadn't been to a cowboys game,### las-, time, last time 0 i went to the cowboys game *t*-1 was during that, um, n f l strike, or the, when they had the scab team, teams in there *t*-2,###and it was the, uh, dallas and washington redskins game.###and i went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets, because a lot of those doctors have season tickets,###and they, um, if they're not going *-1 to use them they'll give them to somebody else.###so my dad, i went with my dad to a game that one time.###but that wasn't a real, you know,### it was, it was the scab teams,### it was kind of, you know, it was kind of different, i guess 0 *t*-1.###and before that it's been quite a few years.###i've been wanting *-1 to go to a game,###i just never, never have gotten around to it.
14692:10	and that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased *t*-1.	certainly	###and so, as, as,###and the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city.###speakerb36.###uh-huh.###speakera37.###now what *t*-1 happens is 0 all those that *t*-2 don't have any money in the country move to the cities,###and they rush *-1 to get the same thing.###they say, why can't we have the same things that these other people have *t*-1 *t*-2,###and the thing that we can do *t*-1 is, 0 we need money for drugs,###and what we have *-1 to do *t*-2 is, 0 we have *-3 to go, uh, *-4 get some stuff, steal it, and then, you know, just resell it.###speakerb38.###it's easy,###you said the magic word there.###speakera39.###which one?###speakerb40.###drugs.###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.
14704:65	i mean, the thing is is that, you know, it's like you might be standing somewhere, right,	might	###you said the magic word there.###speakera39.###which one?###speakerb40.###drugs.###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###and that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased *t*-1.###speakera43.### that's, uh, that's, uh, the main reason 0 i think, uh, everywhere *t*-1###because, uh, you have deaths.###i mean, i mean, you have murders###and you have, you know, people stealing other people's stuff,###and that's###a lot of it has *-1 to do with drugs.###speakerb44.###oh, yes.###speakera45.###it doesn't have *-1 to do,
14774:24	of course, i mean i might be, you know, the the leading drug dealer here,	might	###uh-huh.###speakerb60.###speakera61.###but those people never get caught *-1.###the people that that, that i,###speakerb62.###that's right,###they'll never get caught *-1.###speakera63.###see, their theory is that if i'm surrounded *-5, and i'm going *-1 to be caught *-2, i'm going *-3 to try *-4 to find my way through,###and they're not going *-1 to take me alive.###speakerb64.###uh-huh.###speakera65.###but i have such a big army outside of my place, that nobody can touch me.###speakerb66.###that's right.###but they'll,###speakera67.###you know, it's like,
14815:4	might.	might	###and this guy comes over,###he goes, hey, how you doing *t*-1,###mumblex###he started *-1 talking to me,###and this guy was from jamaica, right.###speakerb76.###uh-huh.###speakera77.###and he's got his little brother selling drugs.###speakerb78.###uh-huh.###speakera79.###you know, and he goes, yeah, i just came up here * to work,###and i go, oh you did,###mumblex you make very good money up here.###he goes, yeah, i make a lot, a lot of money,###he goes, you know.###and, uh, in the movie good fellows.###speakerb80.###yeah,
15040:7	and maybe we'll get *-1 to talk again.	maybe	###speakera65.###it sure does.###speakerb66.###and now without the benefits of * being able *-1 to deduct interest off, off your income tax that's, you know.###speakera67.###uh-huh.###speakerb68.###of course it's been going down for a number of years,###but this is the last year 0 you can take anything *t*-1.###so.###speakera69.###uh-huh,###yeah.###speakerb70.###so.###speakera71.###well, i've enjoyed *-1 talking to you.###speakerb72.###well, i've enjoyed *-1 talking to you.###speakera73.
15070:11	it's definitely up to the person, uh,	definitely	###speakerb2.###well, uh, i don't have any strong convictions about it,###that's for sure.###um, i know 0 i haven't done any peace corps service,###and i don't know anybody in my immediate family that *t*-1 has, or, you know, has ever even thought about it.### do you know, uh, do you know anybody that *t*-1's been it?###speakera3.###no,### the, the only people 0 i know *t*-4 that *t*-3 have done anything remotely like that are people that *t*-1 have gone *-2 to be missionaries,###and that's only because i went to baylor,###and a lot of students from baylor go and, and serve as missionaries during the summer.###but i think, i think 0 that's a terrible idea.###that's like * forcing someone to donate to a charity.###speakerb4.###yeah.###speakera5.###i mean, and it *exp*-2's nice * to, to try *-1 to teach young people some, some, uh, uh, civil, uh, consciousness,###but * forcing them to, to donate basically their time and efforts,###speakerb6.###yeah,
15122:46	or, so you're looking at the peace corps or sabbatical maybe,	maybe	###and, uh, you, you were just up there then, huh.###speakera21.###uh-huh,###last weekend.###we went to six flags saturday.###speakerb22.###oh, okay.###speakera23.###* had a good old time.###speakerb24.###well, that's good.###speakera25.###well, back to the topic at hand.###what other types of community service would they be talking about *t*-1.###i mean, the, the recording mentioned the peace corps.###speakerb26.###well, it sounded like, i mean, this is like major long term commitment, like a year or six months,###speakera27.###yeah.###speakerb28.
15140:13	i couldn't possibly commit a year or two of my life *-1 to, to go *-2 do something.	possibly	###yeah.###speakerb28.### or, so you're looking at the peace corps or sabbatical maybe,###or, you know, i don't know,###i mean, but, uh,###speakera29.###i mean, i'm all for *-1 donating my time to worthy causes,###like i do some volunteer work here and there,###and every once in a while i'll do, uh, a, uh, local big brother big sister thing.###speakerb30.###uh-huh.###speakera31.###or i'll go, you know, *-1 do a mumblex.###speakerb32.###but that, that time is minuscule compared to what, what, mumblex they were referring to *t*-1.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###speakera35.###yeah,
15161:11	i'd probably catch a terrible disease and die.	probably	###speakerb36.###yeah,###yeah,###they couldn't cover my hourly rate.###speakera37.###speakerb38.###i couldn't afford it.###speakera39.###no kidding.###speakerb40.###but, uh,###speakera41.###i have this thing against bugs, too.###and * seems to me like the peace corps, they send you someplace that there's a lot of bugs *t*-1 mumblex.###speakerb42.###yeah,###africa.###speakera43.###yeah,###* have *-1 to live in a shack with no air conditioning and no medicine and no anything.
15172:16	i think that maybe that's why some people do it *t*-1 is, uh, * to see the other cultures or, you know and some of that.	maybe	###speakera41.###i have this thing against bugs, too.###and * seems to me like the peace corps, they send you someplace that there's a lot of bugs *t*-1 mumblex.###speakerb42.###yeah,###africa.###speakera43.###yeah,###* have *-1 to live in a shack with no air conditioning and no medicine and no anything.###i'd probably catch a terrible disease and die.###speakerb44.###yeah,###well. i doubt that,###but, you know how it is *t*-1 mumblex.###speakera45.###speakerb46.### w-, i, i mean, it would, it *exp*-2 would have *-1 to be tough * going somewhere 0 you don't know the culture *t*-3, usually, i guess 0 *t*-4.###speakera47.###yeah.###speakerb48.
15212:30	and the peace corps or something like that is probably useful as, as that kind of a time.	probably	###and they're allowed *-1 to take that time off and then come back where they left off *t*-2.###speakera55.###oh.###speakerb56.###so, it is something that i think, uh, you know, 0 even the larger organizations will support *t*-1.###uh, it's, it's really for the community * to give, you know, * to, to give back to the community type of thing.###speakera57.###mumblex.###speakerb58.###i don't know,### it's for, i think, 0 at the same it's for some people * to, you know, help them grow in other areas,###speakera59.###kind of like * joining the military.###speakerb60.###speakera61.###well, i mean, in that respect a lot of people join the military *-1 to, to grow up and to decide what they want *-2 to do *t*-3,###speakerb62.###yeah,###m-,###speakera63.
15215:5	maybe a little bit in that perspective,	maybe	###speakerb56.###so, it is something that i think, uh, you know, 0 even the larger organizations will support *t*-1.###uh, it's, it's really for the community * to give, you know, * to, to give back to the community type of thing.###speakera57.###mumblex.###speakerb58.###i don't know,### it's for, i think, 0 at the same it's for some people * to, you know, help them grow in other areas,###speakera59.###kind of like * joining the military.###speakerb60.###speakera61.###well, i mean, in that respect a lot of people join the military *-1 to, to grow up and to decide what they want *-2 to do *t*-3,###speakerb62.###yeah,###m-,###speakera63.###and the peace corps or something like that is probably useful as, as that kind of a time.###speakerb64.###yeah,
15225:11	i'd probably have a different perspective if i actually knew someone that *t*-1 had gone into the peace corps.	probably	###speakerb60.###speakera61.###well, i mean, in that respect a lot of people join the military *-1 to, to grow up and to decide what they want *-2 to do *t*-3,###speakerb62.###yeah,###m-,###speakera63.###and the peace corps or something like that is probably useful as, as that kind of a time.###speakerb64.###yeah,###maybe a little bit in that perspective,### but, uh, and a lot of people have gone in the military, i mean, you know, when they're in the college *t*-1.###sometimes it's * to sup-, help *-1 support college, you know, the money.###speakera65.###uh-huh.###speakerb66.###uh, others, people don't know what they want *-1 to do *t*-2.###but as far as, uh, you know, the peace corps. i guess, i suppose 0 there's a few people that *t*-1 have done it at that point in their lives.###but i think 0 a lot of it's, you know, when the-, people get older *t*-1, they'll do something like that.###speakera67.
15257:8	i certainly didn't mark off anything *-1 to get this one.	certainly	###oh, that's okay.### n-, and none of my really close friends in college went off *-1 to be missionaries or anything.###so i don't really know anyone *ich*-3 first hand that *t*-1's, that *t*-2's com-, committed a chunk of their life *-4 to do service work.###speakerb74.###i,###speakera75.###everybody 0 i know *t*-1 has been, well, i'm going *-1 to go *-2 get a goo-, good job and make some money and buy a nice car.###so.###speakerb76.###yeah, or, or * try *-1 to make a living.###speakera77.###yeah.###speakerb78.###but, uh,###yeah,### i, i have no, i don't know anybody that *t*-1's done that either.###so, i, i,###it *exp*-1's interesting 0 we got this topic because i, i, i don't know what i marked *t*-2 off *-3 to get this,###but.###speakera79.
15275:11	oh, probably five or six.	probably	###but.###speakera79.###i certainly didn't mark off anything *-1 to get this one.### i, i can't imagine,###and the switchboard's been down for several days,###and the last time 0 i called it before it went down *t*-1, i had this topic,###and i didn't feel like *-1 talking about it,###so i hung up,###and i guess 0 they, they keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it.###speakerb80.###so you had the same one, huh.###speakera81.###yeah.###speakerb82.###oh, well. well, you'll, you'll get it over with here.###speakera83.###i know.###speakerb84.###how many times have you talked *t*-1?###speakera85.
15281:20	oh, i've done maybe four or five.	maybe	###and i didn't feel like *-1 talking about it,###so i hung up,###and i guess 0 they, they keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it.###speakerb80.###so you had the same one, huh.###speakera81.###yeah.###speakerb82.###oh, well. well, you'll, you'll get it over with here.###speakera83.###i know.###speakerb84.###how many times have you talked *t*-1?###speakera85.###oh, probably five or six.###speakerb86.###yeah.###speakera87.###not a whole lot.###speakerb88.
15382:13	and you've probably never gardened in your life mumblex.	probably	###mumblex so we talked about the cowboys a little bit.###and, i'm out here in phoenix,###so we talked about phoe-, cardinals.###speakera115.###uh-huh.###speakerb116.### and, so, so that one was all right.###and then what else did i have *t*-1?###i think 0 i had some other, uh, like * staying in shape or working out.### this other guy, i got this guy from new york,###so.###speakera117.###i had *-1 to talk to someone about hobbies,###and the switchboard called me,###so i was caught *-1 a little off guard,###and i couldn't think of anything at all.###so i started *-1 making stuff up.###i told this woman that my hobby was gardening,###and i can't even i can't even grow an ivy.###speakerb118.
15514:50	and they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more probably * to age, to age the material	probably	###speakera33.###yeah,### the wagon, the wagon driver.###speakerb34.###yeah,###yeah.###but other than that i've heard 0 the, the, you know, the, um, the scenery in it is absolutely beautiful.###speakera35.###yeah.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###and, uh, the costuming yeah, was,###speakerb38.###uh-huh,###really.###speakera39.###the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that it didn't, that, that, um, the indians all appeared *-1 to be wearing new things.###speakerb40.###oh really.###speakera41.
15664:12	so, it might not be as,	might	###and there were a couple others that i just haven't had the time *t*-1.###speakera91.###and silence of the lambs.###speakerb92.###now see i.###speakera93.### i'm, i'm intrigued *-1 by it,###but i'm not sure 0 i want *-1 to go *-2 see it yet.###speakerb94.###yeah,###i don't think 0 i want *-1 to see that either.###i know,###i don't think 0 i could *?*.###speakera95.###i think, uh,###well, now, we had some friends that *t*-1 went *-2 to see it###and they said 0 it was okay.###speakerb96.###really.###speakera97.
15774:21	i think 0 that's probably true, too.	probably	###they haven't pursued it, you know.###speakerb24.###uh-huh.###speakera25.###uh, if there's some, uh, problem i know,###there was one guy that we tested *t*-1 for preemployment for drugs who *t*-2 absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines,###and he went to a, a separate drug testing firm,###speakerb26.###yeah.###speakera27.###and they showed it negative.###speakerb28.###huh.###speakera29.###so i think 0 the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried, you know.###speakerb30.###yeah.###speakera31.###speakerb32.###yeah,
15795:20	i think that probably, i think 0 most companies now, as far as entry, you know, exams require that.	probably	### that's, that's, that's sort of scary.###speakera33.###uh-huh,###really.###and then i also had a friend who *t*-1 was just around some people that *t*-2 were smoking cocaine.###speakerb34.###yeah.###speakera35.###and he tested positive on cocaine.###now then you always wonder, well is he just saying that.###speakerb36.###yeah,###yeah,###really,###really.###speakera37.###yeah.###speakerb38.###yeah,### that's, that's a bad situation.
15941:29	well, well i'm definitely for it.	definitely	### it's, it's###life is so much more enjoyable.###speakerb96.###speakera97.###uh-huh.###and i was losing jobs just from *-1 doing a poor job, you know.###speakerb98.###yeah.###yeah,### that's, that's it.###speakera99.###i mean, you know, there's all kinds of drawbacks, much less the drug testing.###speakerb100.###yeah.###just life in general.###speakera101.###uh-huh,###that's right.###speakerb102.###yeah,
15980:132	so i think 0 some place, you know, places like that, it should be like mandatory like, you know, on, on a, on a greater frequency than maybe, just, you know, paper pushers like, like i am *?*.	maybe	###speakera111.###oh, goodness.###speakerb112.###yeah,###i mean, and they have, they have some serious chemicals out there you know,###speakera113.###yeah.###speakerb114.###like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water, you know, that kind of thing *t*-1.###speakera115.###yeah.###speakerb116.###and they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals.###speakera117.###oh, my gosh.###speakerb118.###and that's really, that's really frightening.###speakera119.###yeah.###speakerb120.
16095:5	maybe a recipe,	maybe	###speakera163.###yeah,###well, i think 0 we did it.###speakerb164.###okay.###speakera165.###so it *ich*-2's good * talking to you.###speakerb166.###well, i enjoyed *-1 talking to you, cathy.###speakera167.###yeah,###bye-bye.###speakera1.### ok-, okay.###speakerb2.### what, what is,###do you have a favorite recipe?###speakera3.###um, yeah,###that's what it said * to discuss *t*-1 some

16154:10	oh, definitely.	definitely	###right.###speakera13.###speakerb14.###yeah.###speakera15.###and then i was going *-1 to make other things like potato skins.###speakerb16.###oh, that sounds good.###speakera17.### it-, see you don't necessarily have *-1 to dip this stuff.###and, um, i was going *-1 to have broccoli and cauliflower for a, a vegetable.###speakerb18.###that's always a good thing.###vegetable trays always go over so well, because i think 0 people get tired of *-1 eating junk.###i mean, i think 0 they like *-1 to have healthy stuff too,###you know it's,###speakera19.###oh, yeah,###it *exp*-2's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party *t*-1.###speakerb20.
16213:12	you probably get this, probably pretty sticky after you get done.	probably	###speakerb36.###yep.###speakera37.###um, they, they made a couple of those, uh,###they made one for my, uh, bridal shower###and i was pretty pleased.###i never made one for myself though.###but they look easy enough 0 * to make *t*-1###it's not,###speakerb38.###oh, i think 0 it would, it would be a lot of work### but, um, you know, because it's, you know,###speakera39.###yeah.###speakerb40.###you have *-1 to cut each thing or, you know, use the melon baller and stuff### but, but i think 0 they're really neat###and, you know, i think 0 they're worth the time, you know, because they,###speakera41.###yeah,
16213:36	you probably get this, probably pretty sticky after you get done.	probably	###speakerb36.###yep.###speakera37.###um, they, they made a couple of those, uh,###they made one for my, uh, bridal shower###and i was pretty pleased.###i never made one for myself though.###but they look easy enough 0 * to make *t*-1###it's not,###speakerb38.###oh, i think 0 it would, it would be a lot of work### but, um, you know, because it's, you know,###speakera39.###yeah.###speakerb40.###you have *-1 to cut each thing or, you know, use the melon baller and stuff### but, but i think 0 they're really neat###and, you know, i think 0 they're worth the time, you know, because they,###speakera41.###yeah,
16298:42	i mean, no matter how careful you are *t*-1 you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot.	might	###speakerb62.###okay,###sure, su-,###speakera63.###um, it filled,###a lot of people try *-1 to stay away from this###but i make my own homemade pudding just because i don't like box pudding.###speakerb64.###is that right?###i've never heard of that.###speakera65.###yeah,### it, and it mumblex if you, um, well,###first of all i mumblex take about a quarter and a half of milk###and i put it in a two quart saucepan###and you put it on a really low heat.###speakerb66.###uh-huh.###speakera67.###and you want *-1 to use one of your good sauce pans that *t*-2 dissipate the heat because it, it ends up *-3 burning,
16343:24	when it thickens *t*-1 the cornstarch might get a little, i don't know,	might	###i think 0 they're real reasonably priced,###some of them, they used *-1 to be a hundred dollars,###and they used *-1 to whip skim milk into a dessert###but i didn't get that one,###i got the black and decker kind.###but, uh, it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord###and you beat this cornstarch right into the mil-, the milk, you know,###and it does an excellent job,###or * just hand beat it.###i guess 0 you could use a hand mixer###but i don't think 0 it pur-, i don't think 0 it gets it good enough.###speakerb74.###uh-huh.###speakera75.###and then before the milk gets too hot, um, i add two beaten eggs###and i really mix them in good.###and then about a half a cup of sugar###and i let it pretty much,###i beat it like every minute for about ten seconds###and it's, it starts *-1 thickening,
16352:21	you'd have *-1 to probably almost go out	probably	###i guess 0 you could use a hand mixer###but i don't think 0 it pur-, i don't think 0 it gets it good enough.###speakerb74.###uh-huh.###speakera75.###and then before the milk gets too hot, um, i add two beaten eggs###and i really mix them in good.###and then about a half a cup of sugar###and i let it pretty much,###i beat it like every minute for about ten seconds###and it's, it starts *-1 thickening,###when it thickens *t*-1 the cornstarch might get a little, i don't know,###it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch,###speakerb76.###oh, huh. huh.###speakera77.###and you just keep *-1 beating it in.###and it's the,###the trick is, is *-1 to have this blender,###so, if you were,
16435:11	it would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good.	probably	###and i'm like, oh, this is kind of groedy.###speakerb98.###well, how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own *t*-1?###speakera99.###um, actually i found it in one of my mother's, um, homemade cookbooks,###i mean, something 0 she had collected *t*-1 out of woman's day or something.###speakerb100.###is that right?###speakera101.###speakerb102.###oh, neat,###speakera103.###so,###speakerb104.###that is just really neat.###because i,###speakera105.###i think 0 you couldn't make it with a hand whisk or, or a regular beater###but, um,###speakerb106.
16435:31	it would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good.	probably	###and i'm like, oh, this is kind of groedy.###speakerb98.###well, how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own *t*-1?###speakera99.###um, actually i found it in one of my mother's, um, homemade cookbooks,###i mean, something 0 she had collected *t*-1 out of woman's day or something.###speakerb100.###is that right?###speakera101.###speakerb102.###oh, neat,###speakera103.###so,###speakerb104.###that is just really neat.###because i,###speakera105.###i think 0 you couldn't make it with a hand whisk or, or a regular beater###but, um,###speakerb106.
16486:10	and i might put it back on.	might	###because by the vanilla doesn't seem *-1 to thicken as well as the,###sometimes the cocoa is###like, my husband really likes it thick###he says, i can stick the spoon right in this.###speakerb116.###oh.###speakera117.###because i'm always worrying 0 it won't firm up because it, when you take it out of the saucepan *t*-1 it's like, boy, i hope 0 this thickens a little more because it's not like real package thick, you know,###when you cook a package *t*-1, it's, it's a little less,###speakerb118.###uh-huh.###speakera119.###but i put it in a nice glass bowl###and, um, some people don't like that, that, film on the pudding###so you can put, uh, saran wrap over the top.###speakerb120.###uh-huh.###speakera121.###and then once the pudding starts *-1 cooling it makes little balls of water on the saran wrap,###so, when you pull the saran wrap back *t*-1, you sort of should be a little careful, pull it back and shake the water off the saran wrap
16493:59	after, well when it starts *-1 steaming a lot *t*-2, uh, i definitely, yeah, put it in the refrigerator,	definitely	###because i'm always worrying 0 it won't firm up because it, when you take it out of the saucepan *t*-1 it's like, boy, i hope 0 this thickens a little more because it's not like real package thick, you know,###when you cook a package *t*-1, it's, it's a little less,###speakerb118.###uh-huh.###speakera119.###but i put it in a nice glass bowl###and, um, some people don't like that, that, film on the pudding###so you can put, uh, saran wrap over the top.###speakerb120.###uh-huh.###speakera121.###and then once the pudding starts *-1 cooling it makes little balls of water on the saran wrap,###so, when you pull the saran wrap back *t*-1, you sort of should be a little careful, pull it back and shake the water off the saran wrap###and i might put it back on.###but, um,###speakerb122.### do yo-, do you put it in the refrigerator then###or y-,###speakera123.###yeah,
16853:11	that'd probably be pretty interesting.	probably	###speakera107.### what, what do you do *t*-1?###speakerb108.###well, right now i'm just a homemaker,###but i'm going to school, uh, for legal assistant###and that's what i know *t*-1,### so, and, uh, just nothing basically.###speakera109.###are you going *-1 to go to east texas for that?###speakerb110.###no,###no,###it,###no###i don't go to east texas.###i got a degree from t w u,###but i'm really interested in legal, you know, in the legal environment,###but i don't want *-1 to be a lawyer###so i said well, i think 0 i'll go back to school and see about * being a legal assistant.###speakera111.
16911:13	but there's probably something else that *t*-1 might make you *?*.	probably	###speakera121.### the, the investigator.###speakerb122.###speakera123.###yeah,### he, he got off right away.###speakerb124.###yeah.###speakera125.###and i wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that,###speakerb126.###uh-huh.###speakera127.###so i figure that that will make me biased###and i won't be chosen *-1.###speakerb128.###well, not necessarily###speakera129.###hopefully.###speakerb130.
16911:31	but there's probably something else that *t*-1 might make you *?*.	might	###speakera121.### the, the investigator.###speakerb122.###speakera123.###yeah,### he, he got off right away.###speakerb124.###yeah.###speakera125.###and i wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that,###speakerb126.###uh-huh.###speakera127.###so i figure that that will make me biased###and i won't be chosen *-1.###speakerb128.###well, not necessarily###speakera129.###hopefully.###speakerb130.
16917:32	but, uh, they, they might weed you out some other way.	might	###speakerb124.###yeah.###speakera125.###and i wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that,###speakerb126.###uh-huh.###speakera127.###so i figure that that will make me biased###and i won't be chosen *-1.###speakerb128.###well, not necessarily###speakera129.###hopefully.###speakerb130.###but there's probably something else that *t*-1 might make you *?*.###because you could know about, you could know about the crime, but not necessarily be taken *-1 off the jury, you know, not be accepted *-1 for j-, the jury.###speakera131.###yeah.###speakerb132.###i mean, pretty much a lot of people would know about it, you know, and, and know some of the different things about it
17638:46	i get into that for, for a little while and maybe go out, uh, on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile,	maybe	###speakerb48.###yeah.###speakera49.###speakerb50.###yeah.###i found that, true especially from * walking on toe and fronts.###speakera51.###but,###speakerb52.###speakera53.###yeah,###i don't have *-1 to buy jogging shoes all to often###my don't get very much use.###speakerb54.###well, i guess 0 my breakdown about, they say about every six months.###speakera55.###uh-huh.###i usually enjoy the exercise 0 i do *t*-1###but, uh, like i said i'm just not very consistent about *-1 maintaining a, a program.###so i'll, i'll bicycle
17639:40	but then i'll get tired of *-1 doing that, and maybe start *-1 jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week.	maybe	###yeah.###speakera49.###speakerb50.###yeah.###i found that, true especially from * walking on toe and fronts.###speakera51.###but,###speakerb52.###speakera53.###yeah,###i don't have *-1 to buy jogging shoes all to often###my don't get very much use.###speakerb54.###well, i guess 0 my breakdown about, they say about every six months.###speakera55.###uh-huh.###i usually enjoy the exercise 0 i do *t*-1###but, uh, like i said i'm just not very consistent about *-1 maintaining a, a program.###so i'll, i'll bicycle###i get into that for, for a little while and maybe go out, uh, on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile,
17977:13	well, they certainly are living off our ex-, at our expense.	certainly	###speakera19.###yeah.###speakerb20.###speakera21.###yeah.###speakerb22.###and they final get up to where they kill somebody else *t*-1,###and they go through fourteen appeals, and how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars.###speakera23.###uh-huh.###speakerb24.###speakera25.###that's right.###that's, honestly right.###speakerb26.###and it's,###speakera27.###they have really got it better than we do, in a lot of ways.###you know?###speakerb28.
18215:31	and i, i certainly, i, i grew up in a smaller town in texas,	certainly	###speakerb122.###they plead insanity###speakera123.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###speakerb124.###and then three years later they're cured *-1, and let *-1 loose on society again.###speakera125.###yes.###i,###it just, just doesn't make sense,###speakerb126.###i mean, it's a it's a scary world *ich*-2 out there anymore, where you're afraid *-1 to go out *t*-3,###speakera127.###i,###speakerb128.###i know, 0 in, in the dallas metroplex area, i don't go out hardly if i don't have *-1 to *?* at night by myself###speakera129.###uh-huh.###speakerb130.
18242:16	well, we're probably fixing *-1 to run out of time pretty, soon,	probably	### and, boy and,###speakera133.###but, uh, even the small towns now though, has really changed from when i was a kid *t*-1,###but now i'm raising children.### it ju-, it really is.###speakerb134.###yes.###ever,###you can't even,###when i was a kid *t*-1, i would run between my neighbors, three and four blocks sometimes,### and, as long as my mom had a general idea where i was *t*-2 and i was back on the time,###speakera135.###uh-huh.###speakerb136.###and now i don't let my kids out of the front yard, that i can't see them.###speakera137.###see them.###yeah.###yeah.###it really is.
18344:45	we've, we've got mayb-, maybe eight to eight inches to a foot of soil,	maybe	###right.###speakera27.###it's a nightmare.###but, um, i don't know what, what i-,###um, where you live *t*-1 is there a real high, uh, alkaline *rnr*-2 or ash *rnr*-2 content###or,###speakerb28.###yeah,###it's pretty high alk-, w-,### ac-, actually it's done *-1, uh,###it's in the north end of oak cliff in, uh, kessler park area,###speakera29.###yeah,###yeah.###speakerb30.###and, uh, we've got about,###speakera31.###i know right where that's at *t*-1.###speakerb32.###yeah,
18834:12	uh, maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things *t*-1.	maybe	###no,###not really.###i'm not that up be on that sort of thing.###speakerb50.###well, it's just a huge file that *-1 tries *-2 to describe the requirements of what you're trying *-3 to build *t*-4. uh, to one level down from assistant description.###speakera51.###oh, okay.###speakerb52.###speakera53.###oh, okay.###okay.###oh, well, it sounds like you're pretty much into computers.###speakerb54.###well, i sure need them.###uh, there's no way that i could begin *-1 to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need *t*-2 *-3 to, to try *-4 to do my job *t*-5 without them.###speakera55.###i can believe that.###well, it's, it's been interesting.###speakerb56.###yes,
19309:5	maybe they're finally waking up and saying, you know, we can't afford this.	maybe	###it's just 0 the whole thing is so incomprehensible, you know,###if i'd have been asleep for five years, and read it in a book, i said, no, no, no, that didn't, couldn't have happened that way.###speakera21.###speakerb22.###speakera23.###right.###well, it *exp*-2's amazing just because of the drain that *t*-1's been on, you know, both economies that our economy is, of course, been able *-3 to, uh, withstand that a little better,###speakerb24.###uh-huh.###speakera25.###but, uh, the russian economy### they, you know, they,###i don't know what the percentages are *t*-1,###but i heard it one time,###it's just some ungodly number * just to support the military machine.###speakerb26.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera27.###and finally, you know, who *t*-1 knows
19334:52	and, you know, i even had a thought *ich*-2 once that the whole iraqi thing might have been just a, a deal *-1 to go ahead and let us, uh, you know, expend some, some military hardware.	might	###but it *exp*-1's hard * to thing that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period.###speakerb30.###yeah.###speakera31.###even if it is, you know, the best thing in the long run, it just steps on too many people *ich*-3's toes, who *t*-1 are comfortable with the way 0 the situation is *t*-2.###speakerb32.###yeah.###speakera33.###speakerb34.###yeah,### i, i think, you know, 0 what i'd have *-1 to,### i, i gues-, i guess 0 *-1 to answer the question directly, i'm still just a, a little bit, you know, leery of the whole thing.###speakera35.###uh-huh.###speakerb36.###what i haven't seen *t*-1 is the, uh, you know, a great stepping back in the military, situation.###speakera37.###right.###speakerb38.###you know, it's, it *exp*-1's one thing, you know, * to let us go ahead and sort of disarm
19387:38	mumblex personally i don't see as gorbachev as *-1 being maybe a threat,	maybe	###uh-huh.###speakera53.###speakerb54.###yeah.###speakera55.###speakerb56.###well, the, the china situation, you know, the when, it looked like that thing was, was turning around *t*-1###and all of a sudden it was like somebody in the, in the red square or wherever said, okay,###and that's enough.###speakera57.###uh-huh.###speakerb58.###and the tanks came in and, you know, pretty much took care of that.###speakera59.###exactly.###speakerb60.###and,###speakera61.###yeah,###uh, that,
19437:38	it *exp*-2's easy * to believe that they were probably more *ich*-4 forced *-3 into a pact than, uh, a volunteer or willingness * to join.	probably	###you know, they, uh, nobody vo-, you know,###a lot###man, those people didn't vote *-1 to become part of the soviet union,###they had no choice.###speakera73.###yeah,###that was always kind of interesting,###people, you know,###a lot of my friends have a taken us down, the stance of, you know, these people are just trying *-1 to be free and trying *-1 to get away###and i'm thinking more of it from a nationalistic, you know,###if i'm a soviet and if part of, you know, south, * let's say *rnr*-2 south dakota wanted *-3 to succ-, you know, succeed, am i going *-1 to stand for that.###speakerb74.###yeah.###speakera75.###now i realize that the origins are, are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond * to begin with, and that they may have been forced *-1,###i'm not that familiar with their future,###speakerb76.###uh-huh.###speakera77.###but i, you know, i,
19473:7	and maybe, you know, more and more people are seeing, oh, countries hopefully are seeing that that buffer isn't going *-1 to help you,	maybe	###it's 0 they were conquered *-1 by the germans,###speakera85.###and then, just never given * back.###speakerb86.###and then the russians even, took it back from the germans and never bothered *-1 to give it back, you know,###speakera87.###speakerb88.###speakera89.###yep.###speakerb90.###so. that's a, a little different situation.###speakera91.###well, that whole a,###speakerb92.###speakera93.###the whole i-, idea if you look at the russian history and i guess all countries the way 0 it used *-1 to be *t*-2 is, 0 the only way 0 * to truly protect your borders *t*-3 was * to have a buffer.###speakerb94.###uh-huh.###speakera95.###and that was the whole idea why they had so many buffers *t*-1
19496:11	that's probably very true.	probably	###speakerb96.###yeah.###speakera97.###the reason 0 they have the angolan heights *t*-1 and the, the, uh, all their buffer area is between jordan and the, the sinai### and, and lebanon was just as a buffer###but, you know, as you can see with the, the scuds go right over there.###speakerb98.###uh-huh.###yeah,###they don't really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers.###speakera99.###yeah,### there's, there's very little that, that *t*-1 binds you anymore in today's technology.###speakerb100.###i knew a lot of guys in the service 0 when they were sent *-1 to germany *t*-2 *t*-4 they said 0 that's the safest place in the world because if a war starts, all the bombs are going *-3 to go right over germany###and they're going *-1 to land in other places,###speakera101.###speakerb102.###you know, that's going *-1 to be the safest place 0 * to be *t*-2.###speakera103.
19773:8	they might as well have not even been there.	might	###speakerb54.###yeah,###i'm glad 0 you put it that way.###speakera55.###speakerb56.###and i have two native texan children too.###speakera57.###yeah.###speakerb58.###my husband is always, you know, talked about th-, texas being a, uh, rebel state.###speakera59.###uh-huh.###speakerb60.###and, oh, my god, all this civil war pride.###i kept *-1 waiting for,###where's some reference to this goddamn state of texas and the role that they played *t*-1 either leading up to *rnr*-2 or in *rnr*-2 the civil war *t*-3.###speakera61.###mayb-,###* isn't much there, was there *?*?###speakerb62.
19856:16	and then i had probably lived the last eleven years in massachusetts	probably	###speakerb82.###that's a beautiful state.###that's a beautiful state.###see i was raised *-1 in the midwest which, you know,###hell, we didn't even, you know, we didn't even know where the mason dixon line was *t*-2,###speakera83.###uh-huh.###speakerb84.###and besides, you know, if corn didn't grow there, it didn't matter.###speakera85.###huh.###speakerb86.###speakera87.###it sounds like iowa or something.###speakerb88.###iowa and nebraska.###speakera89.###uh-huh.###speakerb90.###yep.
19966:68	see, i had never really been into science fiction that much until, uh, somebody gave me mist of avalon probably about five or six years ago.	probably	###speakerb126.### what the, what the hell for *t*-1?###why kingsley, iowa?###speakera127.###well, because that's where my folks all came from *t*-1.###speakerb128.###oh, okay.###speakera129.###and they had a centennial here awhile back.###i read the grant takes command,###that was pretty good.###speakerb130.###well,###speakera131.###that was part of that trilogy that, uh, bruce canton did *t*-1.###speakerb132.###now that's one that, that's one###speakera133.###speakerb134.###i don't know.
19997:25	and, i think 0 that's probably my favorite of, of any piece of science fiction that i've ever read *t*-1.	probably	###speakerb138.###well, i loved that novel.###and then somebody said, oh, god, this would have been even long ago because i was in boston###and it was raining all night,###and i had a hole in my roof###and i was waiting for the whole house to collapse,###and, uh, i was reading dune. which *t*-1 seeming rather ironic.###speakera139.###speakerb140.###speakera141.###oh.###speakerb142.###speakera143.###yeah.###speakerb144.###and i read the whole damn book while i was home *-1 hauling out, you know, like ten-gallon buckets of, of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and, reading about these guys wearing their little free man still suits###speakera145.###uh-huh,###you're reading dune.###speakerb146.
20027:44	*-2 even having read the book, and i've read that book probably three times, *-2 watching that movie, i couldn't figure out, what they were talking about *t*-1, at all.	probably	###oh, yes,###it was just terrible.###speakera153.###yeah,### i'd, i didn't see it###but, uh,###yeah.###speakerb154.### it was, it was beyond, uh,###speakera155.###patrick stewart was in that.###i guess 0 the guy that *t*-1's on the new star trek series was in that thing, uh.###speakerb156.###i don't know,###i just remember 0 sting was in it.###speakera157.###oh, really?.###speakerb158.###yeah,###and if you were trying *-1 to follow any type of, uh, plot, it, it total-,
20257:16	um, we're probably one of the, the only countries in the world that *t*-1 has all the things that we have *t*-2.	probably	###speakerb44.###speakera45.###thanks.###speakerb46.###* thank you.###speakera47.###bye.###speakerb48.###good-bye.###speakera1.###okay,###* let's see.###i think, uh,###i guess, 0 if i call i'm supposed *-1 to start.###i think, uh, 0 that's the way 0 everybody has done it so far *t*-1.###speakerb2.###okay.###speakera3.###but, anyway i think that, um, we are paying a lot in taxes,###but i think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms, and we have a lot of things that the governments do *t*-1 with our money.
20350:15	i thought 0 maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there.	maybe	###that's true.###speakerb26.###you don't sound like you're from dallas.###where do you, do you come from *t*-1 originally###texas?###speakera27.###yeah.###i do.###i've lived in, in the dallas area here since i was like four.###speakerb28.###oh, okay.###speakera29.###so. uh, it's, i don't know, an urban area, i guess 0 *t*-1###whatever.###i don't know.###speakerb30.### you just, you just managed *-1 to escape the real texan accent,###speakera31.###yeah.###speakerb32.
20471:13	so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get *t*-1 back.	definitely	###right.###speakerb74.###speakera75.###we're looking at *-1 buying a house,###speakerb76.###yeah.###speakera77.###and that was one of the main pluses that we have *t*-1 about *-2 buying a house.###speakerb78.###and it will help tremendously.###speakera79.###yeah.###speakerb80.###we bought ours five years ago###and it's the one thing,###it seems like you make those payments every month###and at the end of the year you've paid all interest and no principles.###speakera81.###right.###speakerb82.
20542:39	that's what we're looking at *t*-1, fifteen or maybe twenty.	maybe	###and that's going on the principle,###it doesn't pay any interest,###speakerb106.###yeah.###speakera107.###or, usually it doesn't.###speakerb108.###so, that's a good way 0 * to do it *t*-1.###speakera109.###speakerb110.###speakera111.###yeah.###speakerb112.###and when we bought this house *t*-2, we looked at * doing a fifteen year note, because it added more *ich*-1 to the payment, but not significant amounts, you know,###speakera113.###huh-uh.###speakerb114.###it was a good payoff for * being able *-1 to pay it off sooner.###speakera115.###right.
21121:8	this might age me, date me here,	might	###fifteen years.###speakerb58.###yeah.###speakera59.###* bet 0 they hated that.###speakerb60.### i watched, i had watched it since it started.###so,###speakera61.###oh, goodness.###speakerb62.###uh, now i, i don't know who the characters are *t*-1,###and, um, i'll turn it on every once in awhile###and i don't recognize anybody,###so i guess 0 that's a good sign.###speakera63.###yeah.###really.###i used *-1 to watch, uh,###i can recall,
21128:21	well, see, you're probably about the same age as me because my mom watched the secret storm, and the edge of night.	probably	###so,###speakera61.###oh, goodness.###speakerb62.###uh, now i, i don't know who the characters are *t*-1,###and, um, i'll turn it on every once in awhile###and i don't recognize anybody,###so i guess 0 that's a good sign.###speakera63.###yeah.###really.###i used *-1 to watch, uh,###i can recall,###this might age me, date me here,###uh, i can remember *-1 staying home, when i was five and six *t*-2, and my mother watching the edge of night.###speakerb64.###huh-uh.###speakera65.###speakerb66.###oh, yeah.
21302:33	i think 0 it adds a, probably adds a little bit of depth to his character.	probably	###i mean,###speakerb22.### i, i just,###it's,###i find him degrading at times.###i guess 0 that is the point,###but sometimes it just,###speakera23.###well, they, they really have changed him though.### if, if you've watched it this season, um, he's becoming, i mean, he still is in his own way degrading and everything,###but, uh, he's involved in that charity,###and, uh, it's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought, that he really has,###in fact, there was one show that he even turned down a date with some, you know, beautiful woman *t*-1 just because the idea that he was, his mind was on the ozone layer and, you know, global warming and all this other kind of stuff.###speakerb24.###oh.###speakera25.###and he, you know, was too depressed, you know, *-1 to,###so that was part of, i guess, his character building or whatever,###but,###speakerb26.
21413:7	and maybe that's what the public wants *t*-1,	maybe	###and, you know, you kind of, you're wondering, you know, well when did this happen *t*-1?###speakerb62.###right.###speakera63.###so, yeah,### i, i kind of agree with that.###speakerb64.###and i like the new lady better,###but i'd just as soon that they didn't have the romance there.###i'd just as soon have the, the police story without all the romance.###speakera65.###well, i'm afraid 0 that's what they, they really wanted *-1 to do *t*-2, um,###speakerb66.###yeah,###i think 0 most shows were doing that,###and then they went away from it###speakera67.###uh-huh.###speakerb68.###and now they're starting *-1 to go back to it,
21452:5	maybe it's not a good example.	maybe	###you always kind of sit there###and you see these two people together,###and you always wonder, why they don't, you know, get together or whatever *t*-1.###speakerb74.###yeah.###speakera75.###and so i guess 0 that's what they decide *-1 to do *t*-2###speakerb76.###* just go ahead and quit the wondering###speakera77.###yeah.###speakerb78.### and, and,###speakera79.###but it's, it *exp*-3's always been a formula, uh, for t v that the minute that two people, that the two main stars get married *-1 *t*-4, that the show ends up, you know, *-2 dying.###speakerb80.###yeah.###speakera81.### a, a, good example of this,###and, you know, this is probabl-,
21511:16	unfortunately, that's probably true.	probably	###speakerb98.###yeah.###speakera99.###um, couple of examples would be, um, well, like i said, this one about max s-, or get well smart, the female character, barbara feldon###speakerb100.###uh-huh.###speakera101.###she had been at the beginning the, the intelligent one, the, the one who *t*-1 always solved the things and, and figured out and kept max from * getting real messed *-2 up.###well, in short, whenever they got married *-1 *t*-2, she got dingy.###speakerb102.###oh.###speakera103.###you know, why would they do that *t*-1?###speakerb104.###yeah.###speakera105.###it made no sense.###speakerb106.### i, i'm guess 0 it's falling back into our traditional stereotype which a lot of shows###speakera107.
21903:18	i mean, you might have problems,	might	###you have *-1 to *?*###speakerb89.###yeah.###speakera90.###i mean, you honestly do.###now i have friends that i love *t*-1 to death,### but, and they have children,###but their children does anything,###we have *-1 to take them, and, you know * to do it.###speakerb91.###yeah.###speakera92.###and that really gets kind of aggravating after a while###because you're saying, well, i work full time too, you know.###speakerb93.###yeah,###yeah,###but, uh, it's just, it's just something that, you know,###my theory is, you know, 0 when, when you have kids and all *t*-1 you, you want *-2 to do, well,###what i'll do *t*-1 is, you know, like,
21984:53	i mean, it's like, if you plan a year ahead, you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know, one thousand four hundred dollars * to send your child to college, you know.	probably	###oh.###speakerb113.###and, you know, people say, you know, 0 it *exp*-1's expensive * to think 0 it's college,###but, if, if everybody would be a little bit responsible, you know,###it's like,### what does it, what does it cost *t*-1.###it costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose.###now they go to a state college###and they live at home you know,###speakera114.###uh-huh.###speakerb115.###and well, it costs two hundred dollars for books,###but you know, seven hundred dollars a semester,###a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead, you know, like###speakera116.###oh, yeah,### if you cou-, if you can *?*,###yeah.###speakerb117.
22048:8	well maybe something will open up for you.	maybe	### so, uh, and, uh, i was thinking, you know, like, oh my god, you know, i go back there,### and then, and i get married *-1 there,###and now i have kids there,###and then i'll never leave the place, you know.###speakera138.###then you'll never leave.###speakerb139.###yeah,###i know,###and that's, that's what *t*-1 happened to my brother.###he came to school up here,###and then when he went down there *t*-1, he was just so bad off, you know from *-2 not being able *-3 to stay up here that his life just went down the drain.###speakera140.###oh.###speakerb141.###speakera142.###uh-huh.###speakerb143.###so.###speakera144.
22194:84	and it seems that * the younger 0 you can get them and get them involved *-1 with programs after school *-3 *t*-2, you might keep them	might	###uh-huh.###speakera29.###and what we have *t*-2 here in burlington, which *t*-1 it doesn't cost a lot of money, but they have a kids council that they have all these after school activities for kids *t*-3.###speakerb30.###uh-huh.###speakera31.###speakerb32.###uh-huh.###speakera33.###they set up kids with elderly people,###in the winter time they shovel their snow.###they have a big brother, big sister program.###speakerb34.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###speakera35.###they have bottle drives,###they have cleanup outings.###and they have also organized fun activities like gyms, * going to the beach, and * playing volleyball at the beach in the summer,###and they have gyms open.
22226:8	they might have five hundred troubled youths.	might	###and she doesn't work,###you don't know,###you can be better than that.###you don't have *-1 to live on the, you know, for a street life.###speakerb42.###uh-huh.###speakera43.###but.###speakerb44.###uh-huh,###that's good,###that sounds like they've got a lot going on there.###speakera45.###yeah,###but it's so cheap###they don't have a problem here.###i mean, um, they can deal with that scale.###speakerb46.###uh-huh.###speakera47.
22274:10	the parents might be thirty years old	might	###speakera59.###and we don't have it,###so we deserve it,###and we should take it.###speakerb60.###uh-huh,###yeah.###i don't know how you combat that *t*-1.### i, i don't know where you start or, with a lot of these kids *t*-1,###um, so many of them, all 0 they see *t*-1 is just the gangs###speakera61.###yes.###speakerb62.###and unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they don't have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from school *t*-1.###speakera63.###well, i think 0 a lot of it is 0 the parents are totally irresponsible, too.###we're talking these kids are fourteen years old.###speakerb64.###oh yeah.###speakera65.
22329:10	the parents might have hostilities towards them, you know, like you're judging us,	might	###speakerb80.###and what do those kids do *t*-1,###they get it at school and come home,###what do they do *t*-1 then.### i, i feel, i feel for them,###i don't know how * to make it better for them *t*-1###or, you know, because it,###they can't remove themselves,###they can't just leave and say okay, well, it's not acceptable,###i'm leaving the big city, mom,###and i'm, i'm going off, you know,###when they're ten *t*-1, they have *-2 to live in it,###and, uh-huh.###speakera81.###yeah,###it's really sad,###like if they did have a big brother, big sister program###speakerb82.###speakera83.### those, those people trying * to help the kids,
22349:10	and i might see it on a, you know, a sixty minutes special.	might	###the parents might have hostilities towards them, you know, like you're judging us,###speakerb84.###right,###i think so,###and uh,###speakera85.###and i'm not good enough *-1 to raise my child, which *t*-2 basically is true###speakerb86.###uh-huh.###speakera87.### it's, it's, it's,###i'm glad 0 i don't live in a big city just because, i mean, not just because i wouldn't feel safe,###speakerb88.###uh-huh,###yeah,###speakera89.###it's just because that i would be reminded *-1 every day of something that i don't see *t*-2,###speakerb90.###yeah.###speakera91.
22405:8	someone might grab you, mess around with you,	might	###so, it's, it's pretty quiet. you know,###we walk the streets at night,###and, uh, people run in the park,###and you know, you're just,###* have your normal smarts about you, then you really don't have *-1 to worry,###or,###speakera101.###really,### even, uh, even in the worst crime areas in burlington,### i, i can walk the streets.###i wouldn't *?*,### i, if i did it every night i think 0 there would be trouble in our house,###speakerb102.###uh-huh.###speakera103.###so you wouldn't get confronted *-1 or anything###speakerb104.###right.###speakera105.###but i don't think 0 you would *?*, uh,
22479:109	so, i have not done, uh, much freshwater fishing oh, for, you know, lake, lake fishing for bass and so forth but, uh, maybe some what they call *t*-1 brim and those sorts of things, but nothing,	maybe	###but, uh, the ones 0 i caught *t*-1 were never large enough * to really do anything.###speakera17.###do they have a limit on sharks,###i mean, is that like a, a sport fish,###can you actually catch those###and there's no limit.###speakerb18.###is there a limit?###i have no idea.###i know, 0 i,###my home is in, uh, pensacola, florida###speakera19.###uh-huh.###speakerb20.###so, it's, they do a lot of shark fishing in that, you know, in the gulf###speakera21.###right.###speakerb22.###and, um, there's a certain period of time during the year 0 they have all along the gulf coast from, i guess from galveston to mayport they have, uh, shark tournaments *t*-1,###and, you know, there's part, either as part of *rnr*-1 or separate from *rnr*-1 the, uh, bill fishing tournaments 0 they usually have *t*-2
22645:10	just hoping maybe, 0 he could pull.	maybe	###and we, we were grouper fishing,###or, you know, actually we were, uh, snapper fishing.###everyone on the boat *ich*-1 was catching snapper, snappers except * guess who.###speakera85.###it had *-1 to be you.###speakerb86.### i ca-, i,###speakera87.###* couldn't catch one *-1 to save your life. huh.###speakerb88.###that's right,###i would go from one side of the boat to the other,###and, uh, the, uh, the party boat captain could not understand, you know,###speakera89.###speakerb90.### he even, even he started *-1 baiting my hook, and holding, holding the, uh, the fishing rod.###speakera91.###speakerb92.###speakera93.###how funny,
22692:21	so, we thought well, maybe there are some crab in here,	maybe	###speakerb104.###and, uh, that i was able *-1 to do *t*-2, when i could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom *t*-3.###speakera105.###right.###speakerb106.###speakera107.###hand picked.###speakerb108.###that right.###speakera109.###the weirdest fishing experience 0 i ever had *t*-1. people to this day are still trying *-2 to figure out if i really caught what i think 0 i caught *t*-3.###we were in, uh, rockport, which *t*-1 is close to corpus###speakerb110.###uh-huh.###speakera111.###and we had been fishing in a canal,###they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area,###and, uh, we'd been fishing in the canals###and all 0 we were catching *t*-1 were catfish,###and we were pretty bored with that.
22756:43	i guess 0 the largest one 0 i ever caught *t*-1 was probably eight or ten inches long,	probably	###speakerb124.###they have a fish that *t*-1's called *-2 an oyster cracker.###i don't know if you've ever heard of it###speakera125.###i've never heard of that one.###speakerb126.###and it has a huge strong mouth,###and they actually, uh, use their teeth *-1 to open oysters.###speakera127.###that's where it gets its name *t*-1, obviously, huh.###speakerb128.###uh-huh,###and this is the ugliest, fish 0 i have ever seen *t*-1,###speakera129.###speakerb130.### and i mean, and they come in all si-, you know,### i've, i've caught them from, you know, three or four inches long up to, uh,###speakera131.###uh-huh.###speakerb132.
22782:53	and the first thing 0 i caught *t*-1 was a sand shark, which *t*-2 was probably a foot, and a half or, uh, two feet long,	probably	###can you eat them?###speakerb136.###no,###no.###speakera137.###ooh.### i, i don't think 0 i'd want *-1 to *?* even if you could *?* if they're that ugly,###but.###speakerb138.### they just, they just look as though you do not want *-1 to do anything with them.###speakera139.###that's like this dog fish,### it was, it scared me to death.###speakerb140.###uh-huh.###speakera141.### it was u-, it really, it didn't look like, it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that *t*-1 just never died.###speakerb142.###well, the first time 0 i went *-1 surf fishing *t*-2 was in mumblex,###and i threw my line out
22835:29	but, um, we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted *-1 to give him some medication * to sort of, you know keep him real out of it all the time	maybe	###speakera9.###speakerb10.###well, i've had a touch of experience.###my, um, dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother couldn't take care of him *t*-1###speakera11.###yeah,###if it's a have to thing,###yeah,###i,###yeah.###speakerb12.###and, uh, she put him in,###but he wasn't there very long before he died###speakera13.###uh-huh.###speakerb14.###but, um, i guess, um, 0 the one time that i saw him there *t*-1, you know, as far as the surroundings, that seemed okay.###speakera15.###uh-huh.###speakerb16.
23081:8	that might be kind of tough, huh.	might	###no.###speakera115.###i really don't.###but no,###when the time comes *t*-1 i'm really, hopefully we'll really look around before i decide on one for my parents###speakerb116.###uh-huh.###speakera117.###* really do,###because i have been raised *-1 in one, you know,###so there's lot of things 0 i know *-1 to look for *t*-3.###speakerb118.###yeah.###speakera119.###and i don't think 0 they'd want *-1 to go where they used *-2 to work *t*-3, either you know.###speakerb120.###yeah.###speakera121.###i really don't.###speakerb122.
23136:20	so i figured 0 i might get me one of those because we don't always read the newspaper.	might	###speakera5.###yeah.###speakerb6.###and, you know, i just haven't gotten that dedicated yet.###so.###speakera7.###i do a lot of work with the boy scouts,###and we try *-1 to do a lot###speakerb8.###uh-huh.###speakera9.###but there's still a lot more 0 we can do *t*-1.###speakerb10.###yeah.###speakera11.###you know, i don't recycle my newspapers myself,###but i noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend 0 they have a, like a, a clothes hamper kind of thing that, you know, you lay your string in *t*-1, then you put your papers in there tie them all up and bundle them up,###speakerb12.###uh-huh.###speakera13.
23216:61	but, you know, for other kind of cans, just to, it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that, don't they.	probably	###i didn't want *-1 to buy a plastic one.###speakerb36.###yeah###because those things i think 0 *t*-1 would just snap you know.###speakera37.###yeah.###speakerb38.###speakera39.###but payless cashways has them###and they're metal,###and i don't know what affiliate of payless cashways you have *t*-1 up there,###but it was only like seven dollars,###not too bad.###speakerb40.###oh.###i'd have *-1 to check into something like that, because, i mean, we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here, you know,###but, um you know, occasionally we have some around,###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.
23230:11	you could probably just, you know,	probably	###oh.###i'd have *-1 to check into something like that, because, i mean, we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here, you know,###but, um you know, occasionally we have some around,###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###but, you know, for other kind of cans, just to, it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that, don't they.###speakera43.###yeah,###i don't,###yeah,###i don't think 0 it would crush steel cans,###it's pretty tough.###speakerb44.###yeah,###so. i don't know,###i don't think 0 you have *-1 to crush the other ones for them to get * to take that,###but, i need *-1 to look into it more,###speakera45.###no,
23264:24	i'm sure 0 they're probably doing that here some.	probably	###yeah.###speakera51.###we do a lot of recycling out there.###speakerb52.###uh-huh.###speakera53.###now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard,###but that's just now come on board.###speakerb54.###uh-huh.###speakera55.###you know, we've been throwing paper out there away for years,###and we're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big earth day thing came out, you know.###speakerb56.###uh-huh.###speakera57.###speakerb58.###yeah,###i don't know what, you know,###i haven't,
23320:11	it's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere.	probably	###but, i think 0 we're doing better and better all the time,###speakerb70.###yeah###speakera71.###mumblex still don't,###speakerb72.###i think 0 we're getting, becoming more conscious because we just can't stick everything in landfills any more.###so.###speakera73.###no,###there's not going *-1 to be any room, shortly.###speakerb74.###no,###no,###the office,###speakera75.###i don't know what new york does *t*-1 about theirs.###i guess 0 they still ship it out on barges somewhere.###speakerb76.###yeah,

24005:82	but if you're serving another dish with it, * say the rice dish um, well, with guys pretty healthy appetites, i'd probably go a third of a pound	probably	###and if you take, uh, little pieces of pork *ich*-2 and you fry them, like little cubes of pork. and you fry them with garlic and a little bit of, couple dashes of hot pepper and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry, just a little sherry 0 *t*-1 to thin it, and stir that in.###you can even put a spoon of ketchup in,###speakerb133.###okay.###speakera134.###speakerb135.###okay.###speakera136.###speakerb137.###okay.###speakera138.###and that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce, that you can serve *t*-1 over rice.###speakerb139.###uh, how much, uh, how much pork do you buy *t*-1 for two people.###speakera140.###um,###well,###speakerb141.###speakera142.###for two people, um, amer-, if it's american style, i buy a half a pound. if, you know, we, if you're just serving that,

24049:21	i thought 0 it was maybe like, you know, like five fifty or something.	maybe	###speakerb153.###okay.###speakera154.###* just stir that in###and you've got a very colorful side, another dish.###speakerb155.###and how much does it cost *t*-1?###speakera156.###um, the hoi sin sauce?###speakerb157.###yeah.###speakera158.###oh, a dollar twenty-nine a can.###speakerb159.###oh, okay.###speakera160.###a can would serve you for, for, you know, for quite a few, um, meals, you know.###speakerb161.###yeah.###okay,
24218:11	that's probably very useful.	probably	###speakerb46.###so that's, that's what i'm pursuing *t*-1 right now###speakera47.###um.###speakerb48.###and i'm pretty happy with it so far.###speakera49.###yeah,###yeah,### i'm, i'm pursuing what they, what *t*-1's, what *t*-2's called *-3 an interdisciplinary field.###i'm a speech therapy major###speakerb50.###uh-huh.###speakera51.###and fortunately i have a lot of, i have a good medical background,###speakerb52.###yeah.###speakera53.###and,###speakerb54.

24338:53	it's i, i think 0 it's probably more embarrassing and very painful.	probably	### she's studying, she's going into law,###another friend going into law,###and, she's,### i, i, i'm really, i'm really concerned about, you know,###she's just going *-1 to be, you know,###what's *t*-1 going *-2 to happen when she gets there *t*-3.###speakerb94.###yeah,###you going,###speakera95.###you know, all of her dreams will be dispelled *-1.###speakerb96.###oh, yeah.###yeah,### if, if, if you've ever seen the program paper chase it's very much like that, except worse.###speakera97.###yeah.###speakerb98.###speakera99.###yeah,
24379:32	and i, i think 0 probably the biggest.	probably	##, i mean, you really have *-1 to be dead set on *-2 being a lawyer *-2 to do it.###speakera109.###uh-huh.###speakerb110.###if you have any doubts whatsoever, you better not get into it.###speakera111.###uh-huh.###speakerb112.###i mean, i wasted a year and a half of awfully hard,###and i aged ten years.###speakera113.###uh-huh.###speakerb114.###but i, i, i wouldn't trade the experience for anything in the world.###it never hurts * to have some kind of a grounding in law.###speakera115.###yeah,###i went to a language school,### and, and that was a, it was a, an un-, i guess, uh, united states institution.###i was military at the time.

24517:8	i definitely think 0 they should be tested *-1.	definitely	###i,###it's just not for me.### i'm, uh, i deal much better in research and books, and stuff like that which *t*-1 is why i'm going *-2 to enjoy the paralegal field a lot *t*-3.###speakera163.###uh-huh.###speakerb164.###speakera165.###yeah,###that's good.###i was just wondering, um, * getting back to the school thing,### so, i, i almost wish that there was something...###speakera1.###well, i, i don't think that it's, it *exp*-1's wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions.###for instance, jobs that *t*-1 require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there's, where there's, uh, endangerment to their own life and other people's lives *t*-2.###speakerb2.###uh, i agree with that.###people that *t*-1 are, uh, driving like, uh, truck drivers and things like that.###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.
24519:30	i mean because i know 0 i certainly wouldn't want *-1 to, to, uh, you know, be endangered *-2 by somebody in a company that *t*-3 accidentally dropped something on me or, or you know, because he was on drugs while he was there.	certainly	### i'm, uh, i deal much better in research and books, and stuff like that which *t*-1 is why i'm going *-2 to enjoy the paralegal field a lot *t*-3.###speakera163.###uh-huh.###speakerb164.###speakera165.###yeah,###that's good.###i was just wondering, um, * getting back to the school thing,### so, i, i almost wish that there was something...###speakera1.###well, i, i don't think that it's, it *exp*-1's wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions.###for instance, jobs that *t*-1 require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there's, where there's, uh, endangerment to their own life and other people's lives *t*-2.###speakerb2.###uh, i agree with that.###people that *t*-1 are, uh, driving like, uh, truck drivers and things like that.###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.###i definitely think 0 they should be tested *-1.###and i'm not, i'm not opposed to any testing.
24549:14	and that's probably my question is, how, how do you know 0 it's done *-1 fairly *t*-2.	probably	### and, because i don't know of any other countries that *t*-1 are doing this###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###and i, i feel like it's really just within the united states.### it's, uh, it's okay.###i think 0 your record should stand for itself. that, you know, if you've been tested *-1 at other companies and you've always come up *-4 negative or whatever, then i don't see what the big deal is *t*-2 that they have *-3 to go to all the expense of *-6 testing you over and over and over *t*-5.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###and once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you're not *?*. i think 0 they could, uh, save money by *-1 not doing that. you know, every time,###say if you change jobs you wouldn't have *-1 to do it if you'd just been tested *-2 at your other work place.###speakera13.###well, what about random testing, though.###speakerb14.###oh.###speakera15.###do you feel like that's an in-, invasion of certain people's rights if not everyone is tested *-1?###speakerb16.###uh, not if it's done *-1 fairly.
24558:13	well, they might tell you 0 it's random.	might	###speakerb12.###and once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you're not *?*. i think 0 they could, uh, save money by *-1 not doing that. you know, every time,###say if you change jobs you wouldn't have *-1 to do it if you'd just been tested *-2 at your other work place.###speakera13.###well, what about random testing, though.###speakerb14.###oh.###speakera15.###do you feel like that's an in-, invasion of certain people's rights if not everyone is tested *-1?###speakerb16.###uh, not if it's done *-1 fairly.###and that's probably my question is, how, how do you know 0 it's done *-1 fairly *t*-2.###speakera17.###i don't know that you do.###if it's random, then it's random###speakerb18.###yeah.###speakera19.###and that's not necessarily fair.###speakerb20.
24596:20	but i think 0 that might be a violation of someone's rights.	might	###uh-huh.###speakera29.###and from that point on, uh, at, the n c double a does have something 0 * to do *t*-1 with it,###but it *ich*-2's almost discretionary on the coach's part of each in-, individu-, individual institution * to identify the ones that *t*-1 have the problem.###speakerb30.###oh, i see.###so, do you...###speakera31.### and, and the ones that *t*-1 test positive have *-2 to retest after a certain period of time.###speakerb32.###right.###well, do you think 0 that should be implemented *-1 in the work place###. you know, as like a manager or supervisor thinks *rnr*-2 or has suspicion *rnr*-2 that someone is using drugs, do you think 0 they should have the right * to send them *-1 to be tested *-2.###speakera33.###well, *-1 not being a drug user i don't have a problem with that personally###speakerb34.###speakera35.###speakerb36.###right.###speakera37.
24641:99	well, does your r-, does your job require you to drive company equipment or to ap-, operate any type of machinery that *t*-1 might endanger someone?	might	### i, i don't,### the, i think 0 almost the only way that drug testing can be done *-1 fairly *t*-2 is if it's across the board from, from the janitors to the executive management.###speakerb48.###right.###i agree with that. because i know personally myself, 0 i've been in the same job for three years,###it will be three years in august###and i've already been drug tested *-1 three times.###speakera49.###what type of job do you have *t*-1?###speakerb50.###well, i'm an environmental engineer###speakera51.###uh-huh.###speakerb52.###and i've been drug tested *-1 three times###and i know many people that *t*-1 have never been tested *-2 in their lifetime###and the company 0 i work for *t*-1 is sixty thousand people, plus.###so see i, for some reason, i've come up three times.###that's pretty high statistics.###speakera53.
24883:21	and, or maybe they're unemployed	maybe	###speakera31.###yeah,###i find that that the, that in the, in the cities, it's more like the kids go there *-1 so socialize not really to learn###speakerb32.###and,###speakera33.###speakerb34.###right.###speakera35.###and the parents send them there because they're supposed *-1 to *?*,### and plus it gets them out of their hair.###and i also find that, that you can send a kid to school,###but if *-2 don't work with them as a parent, i think 0 *t*-1 you're putting your child at a big disadvantage.###speakerb36.###yeah,###and, you know, there's some kids that, you know, *t*-1 want *-2 to go *-3 learn,###but most of them just want *-1 to go *-2 play.###speakera37.###yeah,###well i could, i could see 0 if a kid doesn't have any encouragement if, t-, they're, you know, come from a broken home and their parents are more concerned about *-1 trying *-2 to work
24916:8	that might not turn around in the next, you know, fifteen, twenty years.	might	###but a lot of the industry's moving southward.###speakera39.###yeah,###are they going *-1 to move to, uh mexico?###speakerb40.###so,###speakera41.###speakerb42.###uh, i don't know about that,###but a lot of the industry up in, uh, you know, the northern states is moving south###speakera43.###uh-huh.###speakerb44.###and i'm wondering if that's going *-1 to have any effect, you know, on what you see *t*-2 now.### we're, we're, we're behind down here.###speakera45.###on the,###speakerb46.###i say we because i live here.###if
24919:10	maybe the, maybe they'll bring their good schools with them. you know,	maybe	###are they going *-1 to move to, uh mexico?###speakerb40.###so,###speakera41.###speakerb42.###uh, i don't know about that,###but a lot of the industry up in, uh, you know, the northern states is moving south###speakera43.###uh-huh.###speakerb44.###and i'm wondering if that's going *-1 to have any effect, you know, on what you see *t*-2 now.### we're, we're, we're behind down here.###speakera45.###on the,###speakerb46.###i say we because i live here.###if###that might not turn around in the next, you know, fifteen, twenty years.###speakera47.###yeah,

24929:51	they're, they're, you're most likely *-1 to do better in school.	likely	###and i'm wondering if that's going *-1 to have any effect, you know, on what you see *t*-2 now.### we're, we're, we're behind down here.###speakera45.###on the,###speakerb46.###i say we because i live here.###if###that might not turn around in the next, you know, fifteen, twenty years.###speakera47.###yeah,### maybe the, maybe they'll bring their good schools with them. you know,###if the industry comes hopefully they'll promote good schools.###speakerb48.###yeah.###speakera49.###because i know 0 the town that i come from *t*-1 the, the, uh, the large i b m plant has something 0 * to do *t*-2 with the top rated high school because of their tax base for one### and plus for, for the type of student that *t*-1's going to that school, it's going *-2 to raise the level of the school because your parents are engineers or chemists.###speakerb50.###right.###speakera51.
24991:5	maybe we do, we need some more catholic schools,	maybe	### we, uh, our town didn't pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many, many years just because people are, are in the recession###and they're,###even though we've, uh, enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years, now we got eight percent, uh, unemployment when it used *-1 to be four or five *t*-2.###people are going, whoa.###speakerb60.###yeah.###speakera61.###so,###speakerb62.###* starts *-1 hitting closer to home.###speakera63.###yeah,###but i always,###see it's all, it's all money.###this,###like a couple other topics 0 we had talked about *t*-1 was crime.### it, it's, it's all money based. and what you can do *t*-1 unless you just get down to the parent level### and, and then if you're in a bad situation where you have *-1 to send your child to a bad school *t*-2.###who *t*-1 knows,###bu-,
25092:11	it's probably not as accurate,	probably	###our land is in acres,###our people aren't going *-1 to understand what an amount of something is *t*-2.###speakera11.###right.###speakerb12.###speakera13.###yeah,### i, i agree with you.###i don't think 0 we should *?* either even though i know 0 there are benefits to the metric system,###i don't think 0 the benefits of the metric system outweigh the, the disadvantages that *t*-1 would happen to the people in america###speakerb14.###yeah.###speakera15.###and also the, uh,###i don't know###it seems almost like there's this, it's a peer pressure thing is why we keep *-1 wanting *-1 to do it *t*-2 is so we'll look good to the other nations###because i think 0 they, that's an area that the other nations, especially europe, look down on us like oh, we're just backward wayward children who *t*-1 still use this backward system, who *t*-2 haven't really attained it yet *t*-3.###and i feel 0 it's just pride of why they keep *-1 trying *-2 to push it on us *t*-3.###and it's like, hey, we're content with this.###no,
25093:5	probably, you know, * intellectually doesn't,	probably	###our people aren't going *-1 to understand what an amount of something is *t*-2.###speakera11.###right.###speakerb12.###speakera13.###yeah,### i, i agree with you.###i don't think 0 we should *?* either even though i know 0 there are benefits to the metric system,###i don't think 0 the benefits of the metric system outweigh the, the disadvantages that *t*-1 would happen to the people in america###speakerb14.###yeah.###speakera15.###and also the, uh,###i don't know###it seems almost like there's this, it's a peer pressure thing is why we keep *-1 wanting *-1 to do it *t*-2 is so we'll look good to the other nations###because i think 0 they, that's an area that the other nations, especially europe, look down on us like oh, we're just backward wayward children who *t*-1 still use this backward system, who *t*-2 haven't really attained it yet *t*-3.###and i feel 0 it's just pride of why they keep *-1 trying *-2 to push it on us *t*-3.###and it's like, hey, we're content with this.###no,###it's probably not as accurate,
25140:16	but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population they don't have any college probably much at all	probably	###and it'll convert every measurement on there you know, from one system to the other in seconds.###speakera23.###right.###speakerb24.###speakera25.###there's a lot of people,###speakerb26.###speakera27.###like you're educated,###i'm educated,###my husband is *?*,###but, i mean, a lot of people are flat not educated###and if i have a hard time, you know *-1 putting that into my life, can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that *t*-2 doesn't have any college###speakerb28.###really.###speakera29.###or i don't know how much of the you know,###speakerb30.###yeah.###speakera31.
25140:56	but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population they don't have any college probably much at all	probably	###and it'll convert every measurement on there you know, from one system to the other in seconds.###speakera23.###right.###speakerb24.###speakera25.###there's a lot of people,###speakerb26.###speakera27.###like you're educated,###i'm educated,###my husband is *?*,###but, i mean, a lot of people are flat not educated###and if i have a hard time, you know *-1 putting that into my life, can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that *t*-2 doesn't have any college###speakerb28.###really.###speakera29.###or i don't know how much of the you know,###speakerb30.###yeah.###speakera31.
25144:101	and if we can't take it and use it easily, well, how can you put that on, like, elderly people and you know, just people that *t*-1 maybe just aren't blessed with as, as much sharpness and ment-, mental acuity *t*-2,	maybe	###speakera25.###there's a lot of people,###speakerb26.###speakera27.###like you're educated,###i'm educated,###my husband is *?*,###but, i mean, a lot of people are flat not educated###and if i have a hard time, you know *-1 putting that into my life, can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that *t*-2 doesn't have any college###speakerb28.###really.###speakera29.###or i don't know how much of the you know,###speakerb30.###yeah.###speakera31.###but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population they don't have any college probably much at all###speakerb32.###absolutely.###speakera33.
25336:8	that probably is a little bit under what it is *t*-1 for this time of year.	probably	###speakera13.###yeah.###speakerb14.###in fact, i'm a little worried about this one coming up here.###we have a long weekend###and, it sounds like it's going *-1 to be a little bit on the cool side.###speakera15.###yeah.###i haven't heard whether it's going *-1 to rain or not.###speakerb16.###i think 0 there's an eighty percent chance this evening,###but it's supposed *-1 to be cleared *-2 out at least by noon tomorrow###and then the rest will be without rain.###speakera17.###well, that's good.###speakerb18.###but i think 0 the highs are going *-1 to be in the sixties, and the lows in the forties.###that's getting back to a little bit chillier.###speakera19.###yeah,
25343:13	but you're probably right.	probably	###yeah.###i haven't heard whether it's going *-1 to rain or not.###speakerb16.###i think 0 there's an eighty percent chance this evening,###but it's supposed *-1 to be cleared *-2 out at least by noon tomorrow###and then the rest will be without rain.###speakera17.###well, that's good.###speakerb18.###but i think 0 the highs are going *-1 to be in the sixties, and the lows in the forties.###that's getting back to a little bit chillier.###speakera19.###yeah,###that probably is a little bit under what it is *t*-1 for this time of year.###i think,###i haven't seen the wea-, the weather on the news in the evening lately,###but i think 0 the average high would be, should be about seventy.###speakerb20.###yeah.###i'm not certain either,
25347:51	well, i like it when it's sort of a medium temperature, uh, maybe seventy-five to eighty, somewhere in there *t*-1.	maybe	###but it's supposed *-1 to be cleared *-2 out at least by noon tomorrow###and then the rest will be without rain.###speakera17.###well, that's good.###speakerb18.###but i think 0 the highs are going *-1 to be in the sixties, and the lows in the forties.###that's getting back to a little bit chillier.###speakera19.###yeah,###that probably is a little bit under what it is *t*-1 for this time of year.###i think,###i haven't seen the wea-, the weather on the news in the evening lately,###but i think 0 the average high would be, should be about seventy.###speakerb20.###yeah.###i'm not certain either,###but you're probably right.###speakera21.###yeah.###speakerb22.
25360:11	you're probably right.	probably	###speakerb20.###yeah.###i'm not certain either,###but you're probably right.###speakera21.###yeah.###speakerb22.###well, i like it when it's sort of a medium temperature, uh, maybe seventy-five to eighty, somewhere in there *t*-1.###i don't like it when it's too cool or too warm *t*-1.###i'm much more apt *-1 to get things done *-2 when it's at that sort of in between temperature *t*-3.###speakera23.###yeah,###that's true.###um, one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety-nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high.###speakerb24.###um.###speakera25.###and what that tells me *t*-1, is that the summer weather is very predictable, that it doesn't vary very much.###speakerb26.###yeah.
25398:28	it, uh, it probably was a lot warmer up high.	probably	###speakerb34.###speakera35.###yeah.###one of the weirdest things 0 i saw *t*-1, i think 0 it was around this time last year was a twenty-six degree lightening storm.###speakerb36.###oh, wow.###speakera37.### i, you know, i was going into the grocery store,###and a, a lightening bolt was almost directly overhead,###and it was twenty- six degrees out.###speakerb38.###um.###speakera39.###and i thought, well gee, i've, i've never known it to lightening at that temperature.###speakerb40.###yeah,### that, that is pretty unusual.###and you really take notice of it, too.###speakera41.###that's right.
25507:31	and, uh, i think 0 that's probably going *-1 to be one of the next investments, is * get her, get her a set of clubs	probably	###i had not been able *-1 to play###so i took out a few videos and watched them for a while,###and i, i hope 0 i'm on the right track.###speakerb20.###yeah.###speakera21.###* shot a career low eighty-nine,### so, and my handicap is twenty nine.###speakerb22.### that's, that's great.###speakera23.###i like that.###speakerb24.###yeah.###now it's, uh, like i say, it's been a while for me, too.### i, uh, i've got my wife motivated about it,###um###speakera25.###really.###speakerb26.
25551:48	i guess, 0 the first time 0 i played golf *t*-1 has been probably about eight or ten years ago now, when i was in college *t*-2.	probably	###you know, at least i can get out and play a few hours of golf###and it's not going *-1 to cost me an arm and a leg, really.###speakerb34.###right,###right.###speakera35.###and i, you know, i walk,###i don't ride###so###speakerb36.###uh-huh,###yeah.###speakera37.###you know, i get a little exercise there, too,###so.###speakerb38.###that's,###i've got the same attitude.### i, uh, i tell you,###i started,
25562:38	um, well, * have, have probably like, like a thursday night bachelor party and a friday golf day before the wedding.	probably	###yeah.###speakera37.###you know, i get a little exercise there, too,###so.###speakerb38.###that's,###i've got the same attitude.### i, uh, i tell you,###i started,###i guess, 0 the first time 0 i played golf *t*-1 has been probably about eight or ten years ago now, when i was in college *t*-2.###speakera39.###yeah.###speakerb40.###and, uh, i took, uh, i took it as a p e course and then kind of left it alone for a while,###and then * finally got, got into it when i was, while i was still in school###speakera41.###right.###speakerb42.###and since then, uh, we've made it,###um, as, as the friends start *-1 getting married *-2 and things like that, we've made a tradition of, uh, *-3 having a, a thursday,
25690:115	but, uh, i'd like *-1 to, uh, eventually i'd like *-2 to work up, if, if my wife does get interested, and maybe get involved in a league in a, in a mixed, mixed doubles league, or something like that.	maybe	### that, that's, that's so.###speakera83.###and you can't find that in all sports.###speakerb84.###yeah,###that's absolutely right,###and you can gain a lot of ground *-1 doing that, too, if you, if, you know,### you gets, you get in a rut if you do play a lot###but you play with the same people, you, you aren't going *-1 to learn anything.###speakera85.###yeah,###speakerb86.###after a short period, once you learn everything 0 they've got *t*-1 0 * to offer *t*-2, then you've basically tapped your resources there.###speakera87.###yeah,###you need *-1 to,###speakerb88.###speakera89.###yeah.###speakerb90.
25752:20	but, she'll definitely, uh, she'll make the trip for fishing if that comes along,	definitely	###yeah.###speakera107.###she's does a little fishing,###but, you know, golf would give her the exercise,###she'd be outside,###* give her something 0 * to do *t*-1 that we both enjoy *t*-2,###so.###speakerb108.###yeah,### it, it sounds like we've got real similar situations.###speakera109.###yeah.###speakerb110.### i, i, i go home, uh, i've gone home every year now since i've moved to dallas *-1 to, to go *-2 pheasant hunting,###and, uh um, the, the last time i, i took my wife along###speakera111.###uh-huh.###speakerb112.###and, uh, k-, kind of the same situation.### she's, she's up in the house and talked to my mother the whole time 0 we were out *-1 hunting and stuff *t*-2,
26082:25	oh, my husband says 0 i might buy it,	might	###speakera75.###plastic is just too easy,###i mean that's the, that's the whole problem with it.###speakerb76.###uh-huh.###speakera77.###um,###speakerb78.###well, and you're tempted *-1 if you've got cash, a little bit of cash, and you don't have enough for the purchase, right.###speakera79.###yeah.###speakerb80.###of course, you got *-1 to charge it and keep your cash.###speakera81.###sure,###naturally.###that's,###i got into all kinds of trouble *-1 doing that.###speakerb82.###what are you saying *t*-1?
26161:10	or you probably have something similar.	probably	###yeah,### they, they're not, their prices aren't that terrific.### they, they used *-1 to be *?*,###but they've gotten, they've got *-1 to pay for all that national advertising now.###speakerb108.###oh, it's national?###speakera109.###uh-huh.###speakerb110.###i think 0 i've seen two around dallas.###speakera111.###yeah,### they're, they're all over the country now.###speakerb112.###well, what else,###speakera113.### they, they used *-1 to be good.###i remember when they first opened up *t*-1.###they did have good bargains.###i don't know if you have a place *ich*-1 there called, uh,
26279:8	they might be *?*,	might	###speakera151.###yeah.###speakerb152.###oh lord.###speakera153.###p h d in human factors.###speakerb154.###oh, that will, that will sound wonderful, won't it *?*?###speakera155.###well,###speakerb156.###get you a little mumblex plaque.###speakera157.###oh, yeah.###i b m, uh,###i mean, uh, a lot of people use human factors, folks,###but i b m is what i'm looking at *t*-1 right now.###speakerb158.### aren't, aren't they laying off several thousand people?###speakera159.
26301:8	i probably won't finish it until the end of the year	probably	### they, they're,###speakerb160.###well, i heard it on the news today,###i could swear 0 it was i b m.###speakera161.###no,###as a matter of fact, the i b m right here, or in carey, which *t*-1 is a little suburb of raleigh, just, just hired one more human factors person.###speakerb162.###um.###speakera163.###* doggone it,###if they'd just waited a little bit longer it could have been me.### i'm, i'm, i'm going into thes-, or going into the, uh, dissertation this summer.###speakerb164.###how much longer do you have *t*-1?###speakera165.###speakerb166.###and * get that done *-1 this summer?###speakera167.###uh, i'm going *-1 to start this summer.
26379:67	but even though i love the car 0 i've got *t*-1 now, i think 0 my next car will probably be american again because if i can at all do it, i'd like *-2 to stay american,	probably	###but that's the only, the only difference that i see *t*-1, really.###but i would,### my, my criteria would be, at the moment it would be, uh, american, uh, personally,###an-,###speakera17.###uh-huh.###yeah,###it's the,###this,###the car 0 i had *t*-1 before this one was a thunderbird as a matter of fact,###speakerb18.###uh-huh.###speakera19.###and, uh, i loved it,###i really did.###but, uh, um, i finally decided *-1 to go *-2 check out what the, uh, what the, uh, foreign cars were *t*-3.###so i bought myself a, a, a nissan a two forty s x.###speakerb20.###uh-huh.###speakera21.
26443:31	and i would, i probably, if i had thought 0 i, uh, wanted *-1 to pay the amount of money, i probably would have gone with, uh, uh, an accord or even a, a civic, or something comparable from nissan or toyota,	probably	###speakera39.###uh-huh.###speakerb40.###i've driven, you know, chevrolet automobiles and so for-, and dodge,###and i,###if it's chevrolet, i just will not touch it.###speakera41.###um.###speakerb42.###uh, i had a chevrolet before i bought my taurus.###i purchased a, a chevy, um, citation.###speakera43.###oh, yeah,###those were not good cars.###speakerb44.###and, uh, i was ready *-1 to get rid *-2 of it two months after i bought it,###speakera45.###uh-huh.###speakerb46.### and, uh, so i, i shopped around,
26443:99	and i would, i probably, if i had thought 0 i, uh, wanted *-1 to pay the amount of money, i probably would have gone with, uh, uh, an accord or even a, a civic, or something comparable from nissan or toyota,	probably	###speakera39.###uh-huh.###speakerb40.###i've driven, you know, chevrolet automobiles and so for-, and dodge,###and i,###if it's chevrolet, i just will not touch it.###speakera41.###um.###speakerb42.###uh, i had a chevrolet before i bought my taurus.###i purchased a, a chevy, um, citation.###speakera43.###oh, yeah,###those were not good cars.###speakerb44.###and, uh, i was ready *-1 to get rid *-2 of it two months after i bought it,###speakera45.###uh-huh.###speakerb46.### and, uh, so i, i shopped around,
26477:25	and i, i probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start *-1 looking around again,	probably	###and it was upon his recommendation *ich*-1 and so forth for, you know, comparable, comparably equipped, you know, with cruise control and air conditioning and a m f m radio, and all these other things###speakera53.###uh-huh.###speakerb54.###uh, it was just,### there was no, there was no comparison. uh,###the only thing that i find *t*-1, you know, if i would have anything against it is that it still has that soft american ride.###speakera55.###right.###speakerb56.###uh, not, uh,###that's about the only thing *ich*-2 0 i find, you know, *t*-1 disadvantageous to it.###but, my criteria, is simply something that *t*-1 looks good, something that *t*-2's serviceable,###and i, you know, i drive around a lot,###but, uh, and it's, you know, it's very comfortable on the highway.###i can drive for, you know, ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way.###speakera57.###uh-huh.###speakerb58.###but those are my criteria,
26477:53	and i, i probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start *-1 looking around again,	probably	###and it was upon his recommendation *ich*-1 and so forth for, you know, comparable, comparably equipped, you know, with cruise control and air conditioning and a m f m radio, and all these other things###speakera53.###uh-huh.###speakerb54.###uh, it was just,### there was no, there was no comparison. uh,###the only thing that i find *t*-1, you know, if i would have anything against it is that it still has that soft american ride.###speakera55.###right.###speakerb56.###uh, not, uh,###that's about the only thing *ich*-2 0 i find, you know, *t*-1 disadvantageous to it.###but, my criteria, is simply something that *t*-1 looks good, something that *t*-2's serviceable,###and i, you know, i drive around a lot,###but, uh, and it's, you know, it's very comfortable on the highway.###i can drive for, you know, ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way.###speakera57.###uh-huh.###speakerb58.###but those are my criteria,
26488:37	but, uh, i don't have any plans *ich*-1 for probably another two, three years of *-2 even looking, you know.	probably	###that's about the only thing *ich*-2 0 i find, you know, *t*-1 disadvantageous to it.###but, my criteria, is simply something that *t*-1 looks good, something that *t*-2's serviceable,###and i, you know, i drive around a lot,###but, uh, and it's, you know, it's very comfortable on the highway.###i can drive for, you know, ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way.###speakera57.###uh-huh.###speakerb58.###but those are my criteria,###and i, i probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start *-1 looking around again,###and if there's something out there that, uh, *t*-1 is comparable to what i have *t*-2 now, i'll go ahead and get it.###speakera59.###uh-huh.###you know, the only thing 0 i'm looking, at *t*-1 right now, um,###speakerb60.###speakera61.### i just, i just bought, you know, the nissan that i've got *t*-1 about, uh, say, nine months ago, i guess 0 it was *t*-2.###so the only thing that, that *t*-1 would get me to change cars right now would be if,###see, at the moment i'm single,###and if i were *-1 to get married *-2 and have a family that would have *-3 to have something 0 * to do *t*-4 with it.
26536:16	that doesn't seem likely.	likely	###yeah,###that's, uh,###i went to a, a car show down here about, uh, about two weeks ago,###and, um, you know, of course they had the normal, the ford, the, the chevrolet, that stuff.###but then you started *-1 looking at the, uh, uh,###they had ferrari there,###they had, uh, b m w and all these other kinds of cars.###and ferrari didn't even let you near the car,###i mean, they were,###that's how expensive they were *t*-1.###speakerb74.###uh-huh.###speakera75.###and then you saw, uh, hundred thousand dollar cars,###you saw eighty thousand dollar cars,###and even, even though i, i, i do enjoy cars, i enjoy, um, *-1 driving them, i enjoy, uh, *-2 riding in them and everything, but, i can't see *-4 buying, or paying more *ich*-3 for a car than i would *?* for a house, you know.###speakerb76.###that's true.###well,###speakera77.
26616:18	i think that it probably would be a, a good program.	probably	###bye-bye.###speakerb102.###good-bye.###speakerb1.###okay.###speakera2.###all right.###speakerb3.###um, i, i understand that it *exp*-2's being proposed *-1 as a requirement, for, uh, young people to be, to go into public service.###speakera4.###uh-huh.###speakerb5.###i think,###speakera6.###yes,### all, all young americans,###they did not specify, you know, exactly what young means *t*-1.###speakerb7.###yeah,###yeah.
26617:15	i think 0 probably two years is too long.	probably	###speakerb102.###good-bye.###speakerb1.###okay.###speakera2.###all right.###speakerb3.###um, i, i understand that it *exp*-2's being proposed *-1 as a requirement, for, uh, young people to be, to go into public service.###speakera4.###uh-huh.###speakerb5.###i think,###speakera6.###yes,### all, all young americans,###they did not specify, you know, exactly what young means *t*-1.###speakerb7.###yeah,###yeah.###i think that it probably would be a, a good program.
26621:15	i think 0 maybe a year would be, the longest.	maybe	###speakera2.###all right.###speakerb3.###um, i, i understand that it *exp*-2's being proposed *-1 as a requirement, for, uh, young people to be, to go into public service.###speakera4.###uh-huh.###speakerb5.###i think,###speakera6.###yes,### all, all young americans,###they did not specify, you know, exactly what young means *t*-1.###speakerb7.###yeah,###yeah.###i think that it probably would be a, a good program.###i think 0 probably two years is too long.###speakera8.###yeah.###speakerb9.
26627:23	you're prob-, probably right,	probably	###speakerb5.###i think,###speakera6.###yes,### all, all young americans,###they did not specify, you know, exactly what young means *t*-1.###speakerb7.###yeah,###yeah.###i think that it probably would be a, a good program.###i think 0 probably two years is too long.###speakera8.###yeah.###speakerb9.###i think 0 maybe a year would be, the longest.###speakera10.###yeah.###speakerb11.###speakera12.###yeah,
26628:10	two years might be a little too long.	might	###i think,###speakera6.###yes,### all, all young americans,###they did not specify, you know, exactly what young means *t*-1.###speakerb7.###yeah,###yeah.###i think that it probably would be a, a good program.###i think 0 probably two years is too long.###speakera8.###yeah.###speakerb9.###i think 0 maybe a year would be, the longest.###speakera10.###yeah.###speakerb11.###speakera12.###yeah,###you're prob-, probably right,
26650:7	or maybe * offer them, you know, some sort of an incentive * to do it. uh, you know college credit, you know, something, you know,	maybe	###yeah,###and there will be a lot of rebellion in that###and when you get people who *t*-1 have no desire *-2 to be there in the first place *t*-3, i don't think that they're going *-4 to be serving anybody.###speakera14.###that's right.### that, that would be the problem.###* sure would *?*.###speakerb15.###speakera16.###speakerb17.###yeah.###so i think 0 it *exp*-2 would be a good thing though, * to encourage other people who *t*-1 aren't even aware that they can do such a thing. to get out there and do so.###speakera18.###uh-huh.###speakerb19.###speakera20.###uh-huh.###speakerb21.###speakera22.###yeah,
26671:8	they probably couldn't do anything monetary,	probably	###speakerb23.###yeah.###speakera24.###speakerb25.###right.###speakera26.###i'm not sure what###but,###speakerb27.###right.###college credit is a good idea because,###speakera28.###i'm not sure 0 they need *-1 to be, you know, paid *-2, you know, a super do salary of any kind.###speakerb29.###right.###speakera30.###but that, that kind of takes away from public service.###speakerb31.###that's right.###yeah,
26737:8	they might,	might	###speakerb53.###and that would upset a lot of people too, because they just want *-1 to get on,###speakera54.###uh-huh,###it sure would *?*.###speakerb55.###speakera56.###it would have *-1 to be a lot of, you know, thought given * to something like that, i would think 0 *t*-2.###speakerb57.###yeah.### i, you know, i think 0 it *exp*-1 would be good for a lot of people * to get involved in that kind of program,###speakera58.###uh-huh.###speakerb59.###but i, i think 0 it can't be something that *t*-1's mandatory.###speakera60.###yeah.###yeah.###speakerb61.###it has *-1 to be something that *t*-2's voluntary. you know, which *t*-3 is pretty much the way 0 it is *t*-4 now.
26743:64	and that's the other thing is that, you know, instead of *-1 making it mandatory, they maybe need *-1 to publicize it a little bit better. and, uh, you know, go to the schools and do programs, and tell them that we need your help, and, you know, uh, * volunteer for such and such a time,	maybe	###speakera56.###it would have *-1 to be a lot of, you know, thought given * to something like that, i would think 0 *t*-2.###speakerb57.###yeah.### i, you know, i think 0 it *exp*-1 would be good for a lot of people * to get involved in that kind of program,###speakera58.###uh-huh.###speakerb59.###but i, i think 0 it can't be something that *t*-1's mandatory.###speakera60.###yeah.###yeah.###speakerb61.###it has *-1 to be something that *t*-2's voluntary. you know, which *t*-3 is pretty much the way 0 it is *t*-4 now.###they might,###speakera62.###that's right.###i'm not even really sure *ich*-2 at this point in time, you know, what, what programs *t*-1 are out there.###speakerb63.###yeah,
26760:59	and, and that way, *-1 handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it.	probably	###i'm not even really sure *ich*-2 at this point in time, you know, what, what programs *t*-1 are out there.###speakerb63.###yeah,###and that's the other thing is that, you know, instead of *-1 making it mandatory, they maybe need *-1 to publicize it a little bit better. and, uh, you know, go to the schools and do programs, and tell them that we need your help, and, you know, uh, * volunteer for such and such a time,###speakera64.###uh-huh.###speakerb65.###speakera66.###uh-huh.###speakerb67.###speakera68.###uh-huh.###speakerb69.###speakera70.###uh-huh.###speakerb71.###and you've a choice of where you want *-1 to go *t*-2.###speakera72.###yeah.###speakerb73.
26763:8	like maybe if, if there was something 0 they could do *t*-1 in their own, own, in their own town or city, yeah, and not have *-2 to pull up roots and, you know, go somewhere half way around the world, or something.	maybe	###and that's the other thing is that, you know, instead of *-1 making it mandatory, they maybe need *-1 to publicize it a little bit better. and, uh, you know, go to the schools and do programs, and tell them that we need your help, and, you know, uh, * volunteer for such and such a time,###speakera64.###uh-huh.###speakerb65.###speakera66.###uh-huh.###speakerb67.###speakera68.###uh-huh.###speakerb69.###speakera70.###uh-huh.###speakerb71.###and you've a choice of where you want *-1 to go *t*-2.###speakera72.###yeah.###speakerb73.### and, and that way, *-1 handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it.###speakera74.###yeah,
26772:15	most of them probably wouldn't do something like that. although there are a lot of kids who *t*-1 would do it *-2 just to get away from their parents.	probably	###speakerb69.###speakera70.###uh-huh.###speakerb71.###and you've a choice of where you want *-1 to go *t*-2.###speakera72.###yeah.###speakerb73.### and, and that way, *-1 handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it.###speakera74.###yeah,###like maybe if, if there was something 0 they could do *t*-1 in their own, own, in their own town or city, yeah, and not have *-2 to pull up roots and, you know, go somewhere half way around the world, or something.###speakerb75.###yeah,###in their own community,###right.###speakera76.###speakerb77.###yeah,###that's true.
26840:39	and you, you give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something,	maybe	###speakera96.###yeah.###speakerb97.###you know, it be,### it wouldn't take up much, much, it would take up more time than anything###but it wouldn't take up a lot of money.###speakera98.###yeah.###speakerb99.###they wouldn't have *-1 to spend money *-2 advertising and things like that.###speakera100.###yeah.###that's right.###speakerb101.###you go to school###and you have a kind of a captive audience,###* get them all in the auditorium,###speakera102.###yeah.###speakerb103.
26968:8	i maybe should have taken the higher grades because at least you can, if you have *-1 to *?* you can get mean with them.	maybe	###but it wasn't that bad,###i taught remedial reading kids.###speakera19.###um.###speakerb20.###and, well, they don't call it remedial reading these days,###they call it something else.###speakera21.###yeah.###speakerb22.### but, but, anyway, at the time that's what i taught *t*-1.###and, um, you kind of group your behavioral problems together###that way, when you have your slow readers *t*-1###speakera23.###uh-huh.###speakerb24.###but it, it wasn't too bad.### we, we got long real well.###speakera25.###well, i, i sometimes wonder if i didn't mess up.
27068:33	but we felt like, you know, * maybe just going ahead and * try *-3 to teaching them was bet-, trying *-2 to teach them was better than * have them taken *-1 out.	maybe	###but,###speakera61.###well, i have,### i, i, i've full-,###i think 0 i understood what the, what the kid was doing *t*-1###he was a, uh,###well * let's just say 0 he was one of th-, those types that you wouldn't doubt that *t*-1 he was selling something.###speakerb62.###uh-huh.###yeah.###speakera63.###but not a lot 0 i could do *t*-1 about it.###speakerb64.###well, we had the problem when i was in, with *-1 teaching, um,###i was eighth and ninth graders that i worked with *t*-1###and if we did have a, a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of * calling the police and have them taken *-1 out of the schools or trying *-2 to teach them something while they were there.###speakera65.###uh-huh.###speakerb66.###and you don't know if you were reaching them or not
27135:25	but there, there definitely needs *-1 to be a balance somewhere.	definitely	###speakera81.###um, i don't know.###speakerb82.###well, i spent a year and a half in japan also###and i've seen how their school system works *t*-1###and i,###they go by a complete rote system,###you just memorize everything.###speakera83.###uh-huh.###speakerb84.###and then at the end of the, of a certain time period you spitted everything back out###and the better the memorizer 0 you are *t*-1 the better your grades are going *-2 to be *t*-3.###speakera85.###yeah.###speakerb86.###so i don't completely agree with that either.###speakera87.###no.###speakerb88.
27346:7	and maybe they were a group of mennonites or something like that.	maybe	###it's an interesting, interesting thing 0 you want *-2 to do *t*-1.###i,###how is texas *t*-1 about * keeping your children out of public schools,###do they allow it?###speakerb176.###yeah.###they allow it under certain circumstances.###you have *-1 to, to prove that you're teaching them something.###you have *-1 to follow, a preferred curriculum,###speakera177.###uh-huh.###speakerb178.###um, they try *-1 to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum, although you don't have *-2 to *?*.###speakera179.###uh-huh.###speakerb180.###and then if you have particular religious beliefs they have * to be, they're kind of monitored *-1.###you know, they, they will allow you to,###i can't think of any examples###but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence.
27674:14	well, maybe, maybe that *t*-1 understands colors would know all of that stuff	maybe	###speakera95.###speakerb96.###uh-huh.###speakera97.###but by,###and she did that all the way around the room which *t*-1 makes it look very attractive,###speakerb98.###yeah.###speakera99.###but it makes the room look smaller which *t*-1 is, uh uh, which *t*-2 is,###speakerb100.###yeah.###speakera101.###speakerb102.###speakera103.###it explains why they, why they have everything white *t*-1###but i, you wouldn't think that i,###speakerb104.###yeah.###speakera105.
27674:22	well, maybe, maybe that *t*-1 understands colors would know all of that stuff	maybe	###speakera95.###speakerb96.###uh-huh.###speakera97.###but by,###and she did that all the way around the room which *t*-1 makes it look very attractive,###speakerb98.###yeah.###speakera99.###but it makes the room look smaller which *t*-1 is, uh uh, which *t*-2 is,###speakerb100.###yeah.###speakera101.###speakerb102.###speakera103.###it explains why they, why they have everything white *t*-1###but i, you wouldn't think that i,###speakerb104.###yeah.###speakera105.
27716:50	it kind of bled under the masking tape which, i guess, *t*-1 is probably the topic 0 we're we're really on to *t*-2 that, that the masking is,	probably	###and the lights shine right at our house.###it's kind of,###we didn't know that when we bought the house *t*-1###but,###speakerb114.###so that, uh,###you get some,###the color doesn't really matter for, because you have that light.###speakera115.###yeah.###we have a lot of light,###yeah.###and, well, it, it, it, um, well, it's just, uh, i think 0 it's just the, the, the dark blue to about three feet###and then above that we left it white###so. anyway, it didn't, it didn't change###speakerb116.###i see.###speakera117.###but the, the interesting thing is 0 that paint we wound up *-1 having *-2 to go back and scrape some of that away###it didn't,
27772:10	so we probably have an in-, interesting perspective on the music on the times,	probably	###i grew up in a small town in, in southern oklahoma###i have kind of gone back to, uh, more of a county, uh, flavor in music.###um, i'm not quite sure why that is *t*-1###and it seems like almost a opposite,###but i guess 0 i got away from what i consider *t*-1 to be the pot, uh, sounding music.###it didn't have what, you know, i guess 0 *t*-2 what i was looking for *t*-1###at the time country tells more of a, a story.###it kind of reminds me of my roots of * growing up###and i've, i've become i guess 0 *t*-1 more of a country fan over the years.###speakerb2.###when you say that you grew up, uh, in the sixties *t*-1 i take it 0 that was the, uh, teenage type years###or, uh,###speakera3.###yeah,###that was my teenage years.###i was born *-1 in fifty### and, and, uh,###speakerb4.###okay,### we, we're very similarly aged,
27821:44	and i've developed a real love for, uh, classical music in, probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was, uh, heavy into classical type music.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakerb14.###i listen to some country and western###but i'm not sch-, schooled in it###and i, i've enjoyed the times when i have listened to it *t*-1.###i played a little bit of piano.###i continue *-1 to do that.###i want *-1 to do it###and i never have the discipline *-1 to stay with it,###but when i do play, uh, and begin *-4 to reacquire skills *t*-5 i inevitably fall in love with country western music which *t*-1 tends *-2 to be in some ways easy 0 * to play *t*-3 for a, for a new piano player.###speakera15.### it is, it's got, uh, basically an easy, uh, rhythm and, and tone.###speakerb16.###right.###speakera17.###and it's, it's pretty, fairly well easily to uh, uh, something 0 * to fall into *t*-1.###i'm kind of the say way,### i, i've gone through different periods of life, uh, in music from pop to classical.###i guess 0 one of the things was that *t*-1 influenced me was that i, i've worked in radio stations as a d j for all my college years *-2 trying *-3 to support my way through there, and suppor-, was support,###i was influenced *-1 by all different kinds of music but basically because that's where i worked *t*-1.
27857:29	i'm kind of thinking 0 that's maybe,	maybe	###speakerb20.###i find it *exp*-2 very interesting that some television shows that i enjoy *t*-1 i particularly like the music.###i don't know which *t*-1 is chicken and egg in that situation.###uh, a good example would be, uh,###i have connections but, but not particularly deep ones to the vietnamese war type situations,###speakera21.###uh-huh.###speakerb22.###uh, and i found that i really like china beach###and i particularly like tour of duty###and both of them, i had as much fascination of the background music, i think 0 *t*-1 going on as i did to the theme of the shows,###speakera23.###yeah.###speakerb24.###uh, and i, i've, uh, thirty something i'm particularly interested,###but it's the music *ich*-1, almost that i find myself listening to *t*-2, uh,###speakera25.###yeah.###speakerb26.###speakera27.
27876:91	uh, and my family now knows 0 if they come into my study and, uh, i happen *-1 to have had a tough day at work and maybe i'm trying *-2 to get a project done, uh, at school, uh, and i'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to downtown they know *-3 to just stay away,	maybe	###speakera27.###i'm kind of thinking 0 that's maybe,###our generation was, uh, so in tuned to music of that time that we identify goodness or badness *ich*-2 with, uh, things now with the music that *t*-1's behinds them.###speakerb28.###that could well be *?*.### i, i, uh, spent my junior year, uh, and sophomore and junior year in, in college when i,###a song by the, uh, uh,###i think 0 the title of it was just downtown,###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb30.###uh, and if you recall how it goes downtown, ta, da, da, da *t*-1,###speakera31.###right.###speakerb32.###uh, all 0 i have *-1 to do *t*-2 is hear that song###and i get strongly evoked memories of, of difficult times in school * being behind on work,###speakera33.###uh-huh.###speakerb34.
27890:10	uh, probably about first grade,	probably	###speakerb32.###uh, all 0 i have *-1 to do *t*-2 is hear that song###and i get strongly evoked memories of, of difficult times in school * being behind on work,###speakera33.###uh-huh.###speakerb34.###uh, and my family now knows 0 if they come into my study and, uh, i happen *-1 to have had a tough day at work and maybe i'm trying *-2 to get a project done, uh, at school, uh, and i'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to downtown they know *-3 to just stay away,###speakera35.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###that's their signal.###speakerb38.###they can hear the unconscious music signal behind it,###speakera39.###yeah.###speakerb40.###that's right.###speakera41.###when did you first take your, uh, first piano lesson *t*-1?###speakerb42.
27944:5	maybe one of these days, i'll, you know,	maybe	###it's making that, that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it.###i was never able *-1 to, to master all that.###in fact my brother and sister both, they were, oh, thirteen, sixteen years older than i *?*,###they went through the, uh, parent thing where you've got *-1 to practice or you're not going out *-2 to play *t*-3 thing,###speakerb56.###speakera57.###and when it came to my turn *t*-1 the folks said no we're not going through that again,###they sold the piano,###and is the * turns out 0 i was the only one who *t*-1 really had an interest in it and never got *-2 to *?*,###so i,###speakerb58.###uh-huh.###speakera59.###that's one of things 0 i felt like i missed *t*-1 in life###and i, i really,###in fact, uh, one of my favorite things 0 * to do *t*-1 now is * sit down and listen to chopin, that *t*-2 is played *-3 on, uh, piano.### i just, you know, i can just drift off into some other world *-3 just listening to that for hours if i ever have the time 0 * to do that *t*-2,###speakerb60.###oh, mumblex,###speakera61.
27946:5	maybe one of these days i'll get around to it,	maybe	###in fact my brother and sister both, they were, oh, thirteen, sixteen years older than i *?*,###they went through the, uh, parent thing where you've got *-1 to practice or you're not going out *-2 to play *t*-3 thing,###speakerb56.###speakera57.###and when it came to my turn *t*-1 the folks said no we're not going through that again,###they sold the piano,###and is the * turns out 0 i was the only one who *t*-1 really had an interest in it and never got *-2 to *?*,###so i,###speakerb58.###uh-huh.###speakera59.###that's one of things 0 i felt like i missed *t*-1 in life###and i, i really,###in fact, uh, one of my favorite things 0 * to do *t*-1 now is * sit down and listen to chopin, that *t*-2 is played *-3 on, uh, piano.### i just, you know, i can just drift off into some other world *-3 just listening to that for hours if i ever have the time 0 * to do that *t*-2,###speakerb60.###oh, mumblex,###speakera61.###maybe one of these days, i'll, you know,###i'm kind of like you,

28013:41	but but, uh, a really good day care is probably going *-1 to cost more than you're going *-2 to make at the job.	probably	###yeah,### you, you weren't supposed *-1 to want a job.###speakera12.###yes.### there was not, there's not supposed *-1 to be any reason 0 * to use this education or this brain that you might have *t*-2 for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the bathroom floors be *t*-3 on any given day *t*-4.###speakerb13.###yeah.###speakera14.### and then, and then of course today it's supposed *-1 to be all the other way.###you're supposed *-1 to only want the job,### and, and, uh, your kids should be totally happy in day care, because everybody else goes to day care###speakerb15.###yeah.###speakera16.### and, and we have these wonderful people who *t*-1 are who *t*-2 are totally prepared *-3 to tea-, to teach your child everything 0 they need *-4 to know *t*-5 in day care###speakerb17.###uh-huh.###speakera18.###speakerb19.###yeah,
28049:5	maybe if you get along	maybe	### and, and it just drove me crazy.###speakerb25.###did you,###speakera26.###i could not do either well enou-,###i couldn't put in enough overtime that *t*-1 was necess-, or that, you know, things that *t*-2 would come up at work, that *t*-3 would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on saturdays as * is, you know, as * is needed *-4, because my husband for a long time was out of the country also with, uh, with work, for like three months###speakerb27.###uh-huh.###speakera28.###speakerb29.###oh, yeah,###speakera30.###and,###speakerb31.###so it was you and the kid###and your work schedule is.###speakera32.###yeah.###speakerb33.###well that's the thing, see, you know,
28054:8	* might have been better.	might	###i couldn't put in enough overtime that *t*-1 was necess-, or that, you know, things that *t*-2 would come up at work, that *t*-3 would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on saturdays as * is, you know, as * is needed *-4, because my husband for a long time was out of the country also with, uh, with work, for like three months###speakerb27.###uh-huh.###speakera28.###speakerb29.###oh, yeah,###speakera30.###and,###speakerb31.###so it was you and the kid###and your work schedule is.###speakera32.###yeah.###speakerb33.###well that's the thing, see, you know,###maybe if you get along###for example if you'd been a technician instead of an engineer.###you know, the technicians work the eight to five job and know when they're going *-1 to be there *t*-2.###speakera34.###yeah,
28139:64	because if, if i had been allowed *-1 to work, you know, maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week, i might still be working basically full time or part time, if there was, if there had been some way 0 *-3 to work it out *t*-2,	maybe	###well, still * taking care of the children is a very important job.###speakera58.###uh-huh.###speakerb59.### and, and someone's got *-1 to do it, and be able *-2 to do it right,### and and if it's not mom then, then dad or somebody's got *-1 to move in there and do the job, because the kids really need it.###speakera60.###and * enjoy it,### that's, that's the whole thing.###speakerb61.###speakera62.###yeah.###speakerb63.###speakera64.###i think 0 that's the thing that we're going *-1 to see *t*-2,###well, i think 0 the biggest thing 0 we're going *-4 to see *t*-1 coming up in the next ten year, even in the, even now they're starting *-2 to do it, but i think 0 it's going *-1 to be more in the next ten to fifteen years, is that there's going *-3 to be a lot of women,###and they're going *-1 to have *-2 to work it out to * working part time.###speakerb65.###uh-huh.###speakera66.
28139:97	because if, if i had been allowed *-1 to work, you know, maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week, i might still be working basically full time or part time, if there was, if there had been some way 0 *-3 to work it out *t*-2,	might	###well, still * taking care of the children is a very important job.###speakera58.###uh-huh.###speakerb59.### and, and someone's got *-1 to do it, and be able *-2 to do it right,### and and if it's not mom then, then dad or somebody's got *-1 to move in there and do the job, because the kids really need it.###speakera60.###and * enjoy it,### that's, that's the whole thing.###speakerb61.###speakera62.###yeah.###speakerb63.###speakera64.###i think 0 that's the thing that we're going *-1 to see *t*-2,###well, i think 0 the biggest thing 0 we're going *-4 to see *t*-1 coming up in the next ten year, even in the, even now they're starting *-2 to do it, but i think 0 it's going *-1 to be more in the next ten to fifteen years, is that there's going *-3 to be a lot of women,###and they're going *-1 to have *-2 to work it out to * working part time.###speakerb65.###uh-huh.###speakera66.
28228:12	and a man might say out loud, well, you know, i understand this	might	###speakerb95.###and you, you, you,###speakera96.###speakerb97.###yeah,###you talk,###yeah,###speakera98.###speakerb99.###yeah.###speakera100.###i know 0 that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if i wanted my husband to do something *-1 to help, and even though we were both working the same number of hours, and, and doing things, i had *-2 to come in there specifically and say this needs *-3 to be done *-4,###speakerb101.###uh-huh.###speakera102.###speakerb103.###yeah.###speakera104.###this is what you do *t*-1 it now.###speakerb105.
28239:68	most of the men don't walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that yes, you probably ought *-1 to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it.	probably	###i know 0 that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if i wanted my husband to do something *-1 to help, and even though we were both working the same number of hours, and, and doing things, i had *-2 to come in there specifically and say this needs *-3 to be done *-4,###speakerb101.###uh-huh.###speakera102.###speakerb103.###yeah.###speakera104.###this is what you do *t*-1 it now.###speakerb105.###and a man might say out loud, well, you know, i understand this###and i agree,###but still he was raised *-1 with a mom taking care of him###speakera106.###yes,###and,###speakerb107.###and that's a very hard attitude 0 * to change *t*-1.###speakera108.###yeah,### and without, and, and it's just 0 they don't look at things.
28367:108	but i think 0 if we can, if we can expand the men's roles at the same time, like you're taking care of your child, and your dad probably didn't very often	probably	###speakerb157.###yeah,###well, she's usually in bed by this time,###but she's staying up late tonight.###but,###yeah,###i want *-1 to have a relationship with her.###you know, my dad was a very traditional dad,###and when i was a child *t*-1 i didn't really know my dad very well,###and i miss that.###and i want,###speakera158.###that's the thing,### if woman's role, like we said, if women's roles change drastically, men's roles will, *?* too.###speakerb159.###yeah,###but men have *-1 to be convinced *-2 of that.###speakera160.###and a lot of it's for the better.### some of the, some of the women's roles, i think 0 *t*-2, are almost for the worse, because we're losing out on some things, *-1 going back to work,
28482:42	if i had a machine already installed * at home i would probably work just about every night.	probably	###and i'm the administrator for our local area network.###and i need *-1 to keep that going###and, so, i, i'm, i couldn't live my life without a p c.###speakera39.###huh-uh.###speakerb40.###i don't have one at home,###speakera41.###we have one at home,###but i just don't find the time that i can use it *t*-1.###speakerb42.###yeah.###right now i would rather not have one at home, because i would work at home.###speakera43.###yes.###speakerb44.###um, we've got a couple of portable lap top p c's *ich*-4 at the office that i end up *-1 bringing one of *t*-2 them home a lot, *-3 to do work.###speakera45.###huh-uh.###speakerb46.
28817:10	and you probably do.	probably	###so i have stuck to water aerobics *ich*-1 *ich*-4 basically, you know, the weightless thing and, * trying *-3 to keep this shape that way###speakera21.###yeah.###speakerb22.###but, you know, it's hard 0 * to find *t*-1.###i mean it *exp*-1's really hard * to find a place that *t*-2's going *-3 to offer water aerobics because what i'm finding *t*-5 is that if they do offer it, you get the crowd of women that *t*-4 are,,###i think 0 they feel 0 this is going *-1 to be an effortless sweatless way, 0 * to get in shape, without * having *-3 to spend anything *t*-2###speakera23.###that's right.###speakerb24.###speakera25.###that's right.###speakerb26.###or it's the geriatric crowd.###speakera27.###that's right.###speakerb28.###so, i've considered even *-1 becoming licensed * to teach it.###speakera29.###well, i mean, if, if you know what your routine is *t*-1, you can do that by yourself,
29024:61	i mean, uh, * to add dependents is, is you know, maybe another dollar or something	maybe	###but i, i guess 0 things have gotten better,###i've been told that this flex hour and those kind of things,###speakera95.###oh, yeah,###flex time is great.###speakerb96.###i still don't think that, they after my experiences that they could, you know, get me to go back, ever again.###speakera97.### i, i can understand.###i can understand.###well, it *exp*-1's been good * talking with you.###speakerb98.###but * let me ask you this, since you use texans,###how much *ich*-1 is it a month?###speakera99.###oh, shoot it's only about ten bucks a month.###speakerb100.###now that's for individual.###speakera101.###yeah,
29078:27	if you're in richardson you'd probably wanted *-1 to come to the, to the dallas site.	probably	###but boy, i think 0 i'm going *-1 to go *-2 contact texans.###i really think 0 i am *?*,###speakera115.###yeah.###speakerb116.###i mean, that beats any offer 0 i've heard *t*-1 in a long time.###speakera117.###oh, yeah,###it's great.###speakerb118.###huh.###all righty.###when you're there on weekends *t*-1 is it crowded as hell?###speakera119.###uh, well, it would depend on when you go *t*-1### it's not, it's not excessively crowded on the weekends.###speakerb120.###see i'd want *-1 to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty.###speakera121.###oh, i don't think 0 that would be bad at all.
29087:13	and you'd probably like the pool there.	probably	###speakerb118.###huh.###all righty.###when you're there on weekends *t*-1 is it crowded as hell?###speakera119.###uh, well, it would depend on when you go *t*-1### it's not, it's not excessively crowded on the weekends.###speakerb120.###see i'd want *-1 to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty.###speakera121.###oh, i don't think 0 that would be bad at all.###if you're in richardson you'd probably wanted *-1 to come to the, to the dallas site.###speakerb122.###oh, i'm actually right on the plano line.###speakera123.###oh, well, then you could go either one,###speakerb124.###yeah.###speakera125.###the spring creek one is a lot more modern, has a lot more niceties, amenities
29090:8	i might do that then.	might	###when you're there on weekends *t*-1 is it crowded as hell?###speakera119.###uh, well, it would depend on when you go *t*-1### it's not, it's not excessively crowded on the weekends.###speakerb120.###see i'd want *-1 to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty.###speakera121.###oh, i don't think 0 that would be bad at all.###if you're in richardson you'd probably wanted *-1 to come to the, to the dallas site.###speakerb122.###oh, i'm actually right on the plano line.###speakera123.###oh, well, then you could go either one,###speakerb124.###yeah.###speakera125.###the spring creek one is a lot more modern, has a lot more niceties, amenities###and you'd probably like the pool there.###speakerb126.###oh, god it sounds like i would *?*.
29227:8	we might have us a problem.	might	###speakera36.###uh-huh.###speakerb37.###i mean, i was absolutely flabbergasted at what, they wo-, what she was paid *t*-1.###true,###she was young, you know,###but still it's the principle.###speakera38.###right.###speakerb39.###of course, if she got her master's degree it would all be different.###but, uh,###speakera40.###well, you know, it's hard though because then you start *-1 talking taxes###and, that's a bad word.###speakerb41.###oh, taxes lord forbi-, lord forbid, taxes.###speakera42.###speakerb43.###goodness gracious, if we would, uh, plan our expressways a little better, that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads, we'd cut that in half and get some teachers
29246:17	but, we'll, maybe do our small part * to fix them up.	maybe	###goodness gracious, if we would, uh, plan our expressways a little better, that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads, we'd cut that in half and get some teachers###we might have us a problem.###speakera44.###there's an idea.###speakerb45.###maybe i should run for office, huh?.###speakera46.###run on that *ich*-1 then, no income taxes in texas, huh?###speakerb47.###that's true.###speakera48.###i'm in texas too,###so,###speakerb49.###that's funny,###that's funny.###well, that's about all 0 i have *t*-1 here.###speakera50.###well me, too,### i, uh, i think 0 we both agree 0 there's some problems there
29296:44	i normally find that uh, i-, i'm probably the most, um, news hungry of my friends,	probably	###speakerb8.###oh, really,###okay.###speakera9.###i get my news from a combination of sources.###i take the paper every day###speakerb10.###uh-huh.###speakera11.###and i read it on the way in to work on the, in a carpool.###speakerb12.###oh, really.###speakera13.###uh-huh.### and, uh, and i watch the, uh, actually i watch the morning news before i leave for work.###and then, you know, usually over lunch, there'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news.###speakerb14.###uh-huh.###speakera15.###speakerb16.
29323:10	and he definitely has a very different slant on the news.	definitely	###speakera19.###speakerb20.###speakera21.###yeah.###speakerb22.###so i have *-1 to cut myself down to the weekend, plus after work.###um, the macneil lehrer news hour is on public television###speakera23.###uh-huh.###speakerb24.###and i enjoy that quite a bit.###speakera25.###yeah.###um, one of the women that i work with *t*-1, her husband is iranian.###speakerb26.###uh-huh.###speakera27.###so here lately with all the middle eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch.###speakerb28.###i will admit 0 i work with, uh, someone who *t*-1's iranian,
29343:22	i understand that the macneil lehrer probably doesn't.	probably	###and he definitely has a very different slant on the news.###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb30.###he's very, very skeptical of the news media,###and i will admit 0 i'm reasonably skeptical also.###but he's, i don't know, uh, he's mu-, much, much more so.###it's sort of interesting though, because he does bring a, a much, um, different perspective with all the gulf goings on, um.###he was always speaking in terms of, you know, american imperialism reasserting itself.###um, i suppose 0 it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear *t*-1 in the country.###speakera31.###uh-huh.###well i, i, uh, i like the print news much better than the television news because television news tends *-1 to sensationalize.###speakerb32.###uh-huh.###speakera33.###speakerb34.###true, um,###the,###speakera35.
29349:16	they will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time.	maybe	###but he's, i don't know, uh, he's mu-, much, much more so.###it's sort of interesting though, because he does bring a, a much, um, different perspective with all the gulf goings on, um.###he was always speaking in terms of, you know, american imperialism reasserting itself.###um, i suppose 0 it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear *t*-1 in the country.###speakera31.###uh-huh.###well i, i, uh, i like the print news much better than the television news because television news tends *-1 to sensationalize.###speakerb32.###uh-huh.###speakera33.###speakerb34.###true, um,###the,###speakera35.###i understand that the macneil lehrer probably doesn't.###speakerb36.###they, um, tend *-1 to spend quite a bit of time on one story.###speakera37.###uh-huh.###speakerb38.
29473:7	and probably more importantly, one that *t*-1 lasted short enough that, that people's interest didn't flag too badly.	probably	###speakerb74.###uh-huh.###speakera75.###speakerb76.###i suppose 0 that is a valuable service.###again *-2 not having, uh, lived through another war, i don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of *t*-1, or if that was a new concern with people.###speakera77.###well back during the viet nam conflict that no one will, will have the guts enough * to call *t*-1 a real war###speakerb78.###speakera79.###speakerb80.###uh-huh.###speakera81.###uh, the, that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal.###speakerb82.###that's true.###that's true.###speakera83.###so i don't think 0 there's ever been a war that *t*-1's been so thoroughly covered *-2 by the news.###speakerb84.
29571:32	and my, my fiancee takes probably six sunday papers.	probably	###the comics are better in this newspaper.###speakerb112.###speakera113.###this newspaper has the far side and the comics that i enjoy *t*-1###and the other one has some weird ones that i've never heard of *t*-1.###so,###speakerb114.### i, i actually take both newspapers on the weekends.###speakera115.###do you?###speakerb116.###i figure 0 i'm only taking on the weekend,###and i can afford that.###speakera117.###yeah.###speakerb118.### i, i find the news reporting in the morning news to be better,###but i sort of have a liberal political slant,###and the morning news just has an incredibly conservative editorial, um, outlook.###speakera119.
29586:33	um, i guess, um, 0 this is probably really a good subject for me because i really like *-1 to do, uh, hand work.	probably	###speakerb118.### i, i find the news reporting in the morning news to be better,###but i sort of have a liberal political slant,###and the morning news just has an incredibly conservative editorial, um, outlook.###speakera119.###and my, my fiancee takes probably six sunday papers.###speakerb120.###i get the times herald just *-1 to balance that out a little bit.###speakera121.###he takes both san antonio papers, an austin paper, both houston papers,###i guess 0 he takes seven,###the san marcos paper and the new braunsfel paper,###but he's a football coach at southwest texas state university,###so he's getting all the sports sections.###speakerb122.###uh-huh.###speakera123.###and, so, you know, he has these stacks of sunday newspapers that *t*-1 go *-2 unread...###speakera1.###okay,
29627:29	that, that would be definitely something 0 you'd want *-1 to keep *t*-2.	definitely	###speakerb10.###i do crochet and a lot of, uh, things like that,###and i have very little of my own stuff,###and it's kind of embarrassing.###people say * let me see some of your work.###speakera11.###speakerb12.###oh well, can you do it mumblex?###speakera13.###yeah,###isn't that funny.###i guess 0 i do have one thing.###a friend of mine gave me a clock kit###speakerb14.###ooh.###speakera15.###and, i, i needlepointed the face,###and i, uh, kept that because she gave me that.###so,###speakerb16.
29694:11	i've probably seen it, though,	probably	###oh.###speakerb30.###it's one of those things### i did-, i didn't give them away,###but i didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves or, or what,###speakera31.###yeah,###speakerb32.###and it,###i was so proud of them when i got them finished *-1 *t*-2,###but i have no idea where they are *t*-1.###speakera33.###what did you call that *t*-1?###speakerb34.###bargello.###it's b, a, r, g, e, double l, o###speakera35.###huh.###that's,###i've never heard of that before.
29757:10	oh, definitely,	definitely	###like fabric that *t*-1's been stiffened *-2.###speakera49.###yeah.###speakerb50.###yes.###speakera51.###i've never done that,###and those are so neat.###i mean, i would really like *-1 to do those###but, um.###speakerb52.###i've seen some,###and there, there, they,###i suspect 0 they're fairly simple, because the one lady 0 i've seen *t*-1, 0 i know that *t*-2 does it, i've never asked her any questions,###but she has three kids all under the age of like six.###speakera53.###speakerb54.### and, and they're all a handful.###so it's got *-1 to be something 0 she can do *t*-2 fairly easily and fairly quickly.###speakera55.
29823:8	you definitely don't have time.	definitely	###uh, and i hate *-1 to dust.###speakera75.###i know.###speakerb76.###so first thing 0 i think of *t*-1 is how easy *ich*-4 would this, thing be *t*-2 0 * to clean *t*-3.###speakera77.###speakerb78.###speakera79.###that's funny.###no,###i do some,###i have really gotten out of it.###i don't do it quite as much as i used *-1 to *?*. um, i guess 0 *t*-2 because i, i went back to school,###so i don't have as much time.###speakerb80.###oh, you don't have time.###speakera81.###no,###and i have two children also.###speakerb82.
29893:11	i'm probably going *-1 to hear about it the rest of my life.	probably	###i have done a little bit of that,###but i decided that that's something that *t*-1 demands my tim-, my, my total attention.###speakera97.###uh-huh.###speakerb98.###and so i've got *-1 to have total, almost total silence.###i can't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate.###it sounds like you'd have lots of shading on that particular piece.###speakera99.###uh-huh.###speakerb100.###speakera101.###yep.###speakerb102.###it is not, does not sound like an easy one 0 * to finish *t*-1.###speakera103.###no,###it really isn't *?*,###and i tell you,###really, i could just kick myself for *-1 even starting it, because i have a feeling 0 i'm never going *-2 to get it done.
30023:56	and, uh, so we'll pay a little interest *ich*-1 this year, but maybe two dollars.	maybe	###speakera13.###wow.###speakerb14.###uh, at least that's one number for this range of numbers 0 i have, 0 i have heard *t*-1.###speakera15.###right.###speakerb16.###do you use them frequently###or,###speakera17.###well, we, uh, me and my wife, when, when we have like extra money that we know 0 we're going *-1 to have *t*-2, and we can put it in our budget *t*-3, yeah, we'll, we'll use it.###but like last year, i think 0 we paid,###i think 0 it was like twenty something cents interest, on our visa.###speakerb18.###speakera19.###speakerb20.###uh-huh.###speakera21.###and i think this, this year we, uh, i think 0 *t*-1 we used it for christmas,###and we got caught *-1 just a few days on our grace period.
30127:76	if it were, say sixty or seventy francs a night that would mean 0 it would be about ten dollars or so, or maybe twenty dolls-,	maybe	###speakera61.###uh-huh.###speakerb62.###uh, for example, i remember 0 on one trip to france when i started *-1 planning the trip *t*-2, i think, uh, a dollar was worth nine or ten francs and just in a matter of a week or two the dollar fell against the franc, drastically.###speakera63.###uh-huh.###speakerb64.###and whe-, when i finally got over there *t*-1, it had fallen, uh, two or three francs to the dollar.###so the,###speakera65.###wow.###speakerb66.###so, i got caught *-1 a little short in that regard,###speakera67.###wow.###speakerb68.###but, uh uh, i, i was anticipating, you know, 0 my room would cost, uh, * let's say###speakera69.###yeah.###speakerb70.
30131:5	maybe it would be more than that.	maybe	###speakera63.###uh-huh.###speakerb64.###and whe-, when i finally got over there *t*-1, it had fallen, uh, two or three francs to the dollar.###so the,###speakera65.###wow.###speakerb66.###so, i got caught *-1 a little short in that regard,###speakera67.###wow.###speakerb68.###but, uh uh, i, i was anticipating, you know, 0 my room would cost, uh, * let's say###speakera69.###yeah.###speakerb70.###if it were, say sixty or seventy francs a night that would mean 0 it would be about ten dollars or so, or maybe twenty dolls-,###speakera71.###right.###speakerb72.
30302:11	it's probably pretty close to what i have *t*-1, because i have the same kind of thing at work.	probably	###speakera9.###do you have,###speakerb10.###what do you have *t*-1, at home?###speakera11.###we have an, um,###actually it's a t i computer,###but it is the i b m um, clone.###speakerb12.###uh-huh.###speakera13.###it's not the t i p c from back when.###speakerb14.###right.###speakera15.###speakerb16.###from the oldies but the goodies.###speakera17.###right.###speakerb18.
30370:10	oh, definitely,	definitely	###yes,###you can *?*,###that's right.###speakerb36.###that's wonderful.###i have often thought that, that *-1 having one at home would be neat.###i just don't know if we would really use it that much. you know.###speakera37.###we really,### we deci-, we didn't decide *-1 to get one until i started *-2 working at home.###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###speakera39.### then, you know, then, we thought, well we can use it for, you know, some personal things.###we di-,###for us it *exp*-1 really took, you know, a business application * to justify the expense of it.###speakerb40.###uh-huh.###speakera41.###speakerb42.
30371:4	definitely.	definitely	###you can *?*,###that's right.###speakerb36.###that's wonderful.###i have often thought that, that *-1 having one at home would be neat.###i just don't know if we would really use it that much. you know.###speakera37.###we really,### we deci-, we didn't decide *-1 to get one until i started *-2 working at home.###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###speakera39.### then, you know, then, we thought, well we can use it for, you know, some personal things.###we di-,###for us it *exp*-1 really took, you know, a business application * to justify the expense of it.###speakerb40.###uh-huh.###speakera41.###speakerb42.###oh, definitely,
30372:60	i know 0 my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer, oh, i guess *rnr*-1, probably three years ago for christmas,	probably	###that's right.###speakerb36.###that's wonderful.###i have often thought that, that *-1 having one at home would be neat.###i just don't know if we would really use it that much. you know.###speakera37.###we really,### we deci-, we didn't decide *-1 to get one until i started *-2 working at home.###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###speakera39.### then, you know, then, we thought, well we can use it for, you know, some personal things.###we di-,###for us it *exp*-1 really took, you know, a business application * to justify the expense of it.###speakerb40.###uh-huh.###speakera41.###speakerb42.###oh, definitely,###definitely.
30428:21	there are some definitely, some, some advantages to it.	definitely	###and he just ripped them off.###they go through just a continuous thing on the printer###speakera53.###right.###speakerb54.###and he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes###and there they went.###you know, and he said, you know, i can balance my checkbook in seconds, you know because it's all in the computer, you know.###speakera55.###right.###speakerb56.###so.###speakera57.###and you know there's not going *-1 to be those adding mistakes that we all make *t*-2.###speakerb58.###that's exactly why.### he said, you know, he said, * used *-2 to be 0 i always sat *-1 looking for those, you know.###he said this way there isn't any.###you know, it does it for you.###so. this, you know,
30496:10	and they probably used *-1 to have it.	probably	###everything has *-1 to be typed *-2.###i mean, they require it.###you have *-1 to type it you know,###speakera75.###right.###speakerb76.### and, and so i'm up here, you know, nights and weekends you know, *-1 working on the little p-, on the p c up here, you know, typing stuff.###so i can see where it would be a great advantage * to have one at home, you know, if you were going to school *t*-1.###speakera77.###yeah,###any more i don't even know if they have, if a college kid would have a typewriter.###speakerb78.###well, you,###i don't know.###speakera79.###probably not even,###no.###speakerb80.###no,###no,
30548:25	i continued *-1 working there for probably another year.	probably	###at least.###speakerb96.###at least.###speakera97.###i mean, and then of course you have some changes 0 * to make *t*-1, and do the whole thing over.###you take out a sentence,###on a computer you take it out, bleep, print it out,###fine.###speakerb98.###uh-huh.###speakera99.###* take out a sentence on a piece of paper,###speakerb100.###you do the whole thing over.###speakera101.###right.###speakerb102.###that's right.###you know, i remember when i was working in high school *t*-1, you know,###i was working in an office, right after i got out of high school
30566:11	that's probably one of the problems and frustrations that it's brought *t*-1 about, because people do feel like, oh well, we can just change it.	probably	###you know, i remember when i was working in high school *t*-1, you know,###i was working in an office, right after i got out of high school###i continued *-1 working there for probably another year.###and we did everything on a typewriter everything.###speakera103.###oh, yeah.###speakerb104.###but it's amazing, you know,###then, when, where, you know, someone would have you type a letter *t*-1, they did it right, they did it right.###i mean, they were,###speakera105.###the first time.###speakerb106.###yeah,###they sit there###and they go, is this really what i want *-2 to say *t*-1,###and you typed it###and that was it,###and now, you know people just send it back over and over and over and over.###speakera107.
30614:19	so. anyway, maybe, you know, maybe it'll, it'll help in some way,	maybe	###speakerb118.###and it's like, you know, it's ridiculous###and that was, that was the high week,###but it's running about seventy which *t*-1 is still ridiculous * to have *-3 to make changes to seventy percent of everything that she types *t*-2.###speakera119.###uh-huh.###speakerb120.###speakera121.###well, it *ich*-1's good that she does that, i mean, bring it to people's attention.###speakerb122.###well, that's exactly right.###you know, she keeps, you know keeps several weeks' worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes *-2 to show, you know, * look, this didn't really need *-1 to be changed *-3.###you know, this is ridiculous###and you know, *-1 changing, * add this time to now.###speakera123.###speakerb124.###you know, i mean, that's the kind of things, you know, that she's keeping *t*-1 and showing, that, this was a big waste of time, it was a waste of paper, it *exp*-2 was a waste, you know * to change something like that.###speakera125.###right,###speakerb126.
30614:37	so. anyway, maybe, you know, maybe it'll, it'll help in some way,	maybe	###speakerb118.###and it's like, you know, it's ridiculous###and that was, that was the high week,###but it's running about seventy which *t*-1 is still ridiculous * to have *-3 to make changes to seventy percent of everything that she types *t*-2.###speakera119.###uh-huh.###speakerb120.###speakera121.###well, it *ich*-1's good that she does that, i mean, bring it to people's attention.###speakerb122.###well, that's exactly right.###you know, she keeps, you know keeps several weeks' worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes *-2 to show, you know, * look, this didn't really need *-1 to be changed *-3.###you know, this is ridiculous###and you know, *-1 changing, * add this time to now.###speakera123.###speakerb124.###you know, i mean, that's the kind of things, you know, that she's keeping *t*-1 and showing, that, this was a big waste of time, it was a waste of paper, it *exp*-2 was a waste, you know * to change something like that.###speakera125.###right,###speakerb126.
30616:24	there, there definitely even with the few disadvantages like that are far better than the alternative.	definitely	###and that was, that was the high week,###but it's running about seventy which *t*-1 is still ridiculous * to have *-3 to make changes to seventy percent of everything that she types *t*-2.###speakera119.###uh-huh.###speakerb120.###speakera121.###well, it *ich*-1's good that she does that, i mean, bring it to people's attention.###speakerb122.###well, that's exactly right.###you know, she keeps, you know keeps several weeks' worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes *-2 to show, you know, * look, this didn't really need *-1 to be changed *-3.###you know, this is ridiculous###and you know, *-1 changing, * add this time to now.###speakera123.###speakerb124.###you know, i mean, that's the kind of things, you know, that she's keeping *t*-1 and showing, that, this was a big waste of time, it was a waste of paper, it *exp*-2 was a waste, you know * to change something like that.###speakera125.###right,###speakerb126.###so. anyway, maybe, you know, maybe it'll, it'll help in some way,###but i don't know.
31039:36	i guess 0 they, they'll probably come out with a lot of movies, you know.	probably	###and they just change the title and, uh, and reshot a few parts, you know, where they, yeah, you know, where they could *?* *t*-1.###i guess 0 they figured 0 we wouldn't, can't tell the difference between an,###speakera117.###actual names, will not be used *-1.###speakerb118.###yeah.###speakera119.###speakerb120.###right.###speakera121.###speakerb122.###speakera123.###eventually i'm sure they will come out with the, the, the proper names.###speakerb124.###yeah.###speakera125.###speakerb126.###right.###it was such a,###it,
31042:8	they probably do the story of someone who *t*-1 was shot *-2 down early in the war or something and how he survived *t*-3 or, or about, or about those two newsmen or whatever that *t*-4 got captured *-5.	probably	###actual names, will not be used *-1.###speakerb118.###yeah.###speakera119.###speakerb120.###right.###speakera121.###speakerb122.###speakera123.###eventually i'm sure they will come out with the, the, the proper names.###speakerb124.###yeah.###speakera125.###speakerb126.###right.###it was such a,###it,###i guess 0 they, they'll probably come out with a lot of movies, you know.### it was, it was such a rout though, you know.###i don't know, you know,
31062:26	well, i think 0 we've probably,	probably	###they probably do the story of someone who *t*-1 was shot *-2 down early in the war or something and how he survived *t*-3 or, or about, or about those two newsmen or whatever that *t*-4 got captured *-5.###speakera127.###latest story,###speakerb128.###speakera129.###uh-huh.###kevin costner i understand is supposed *-1 to be play schwartzkopf, supposedly.###speakerb130.###is that right?###speakera131.###i don't know.###speakerb132.###speakera133.###that's just one of the many rumors that *t*-1 floats around.###speakerb134.###yeah.###speakera135.###or what you read *t*-1.###speakerb136.###uh-huh.
31188:15	some of those certainly have a lot of dis-, difficulties, you know, with, uh, all sorts of things,	certainly	###and there is a real dichotomy in terms of educational and economic background of the kids that *t*-1 are going *-2 to be attending this school.###speakerb41.###uh-huh.###speakera42.###and i used *-1 to think, well, that's wonderful.###you know, they can get a real life experience.###what i'm seeing *t*-1 now, uh, in terms of kindergarten preparedness, just from, in, in, in different preschools it's like day and night.###speakerb43.###uh-huh.###speakera44.###and i wonder, how do they handle a child who *t*-1 is obviously very ready and another child who *t*-2 doesn't even speak english, let alone know her colors *t*-3.###speakerb45.###yeah.###speakera46.###and they're in the same classrooms.###and i guess also 0 you're going *-1 to see the first of the, uh, crack kids starting kindergarten.###my god, i think 0 it would be next year is what i'd read *t*-1.###i thought, well, how do you, how do you weed those out *t*-1?###speakerb47.###yes.
31208:78	are the rest of us who *t*-1 went for the big bucks, you know, staying out of, you know, where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated *-2 to spend some time *-4 teaching or something with these kids *t*-3?	maybe	###some of those certainly have a lot of dis-, difficulties, you know, with, uh, all sorts of things,###speakera48.###speakerb49.###and i would imagine 0 their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases.###speakera50.###when i was listening to n p r, the national public radio *t*-1,###and they've quoted statistics that i just about, my throat just about fell into my toes *t*-1.###they said 0 at the bottom of the s a t scores of graduating college seniors are usually *t*-2 those people that *t*-1 go into education.###speakerb51.###oh, wow.###speakera52.###yes.###speakerb53.###that's encouraging.###speakera54.###yes.### and i, and i, i got to *-3 thinking back when i was teaching college chemistry *t*-1,###the people that *t*-2 took, you know, the lower level courses, i sometimes wondered, you know, are they really even educatable or trainable###and it,###my god, you know, i-,
31263:31	you're telling them that, hey, you might as well forget it, you know.	might	###mine didn't, did not fall into the gifted category.###speakera70.###oh, * don't say that.###speakerb71.###nope.###and i would never had said so either.###uh, but, uh, they managed *-1 to get through, although not always with flying colors.###uh, in fact, one of the incidents 0 i was thinking of *t*-1 that my son had *t*-2. uh, he was struggling with senior english###and i had a meeting with the, uh, vice principal and the english instructor,###and, uh, she showed me a paper that he had just handed *t*-1 in.###and she told me what she had requested *t*-1.###and i read it###and while it had, you know, a few little grammatical problems, it wasn't very long and so forth. i thought 0 it had some nice, well thought out, uh, parts to it.###speakera72.###uh-huh.###speakerb73.###she gave him an f on that paper.###and i thought, well now, here you have a student who *t*-1 is trying *-3 to pass, who *t*-2 is struggling with your subject###and you give them an f on something that *t*-1 doesn't seem that bad to me.###what are you telling that student *t*-1?
31323:13	otherwise, he might have been driving trucks or framing houses, you know, from here to eternity.	might	###and they put him through six months of composition writing in addition to all his electronic training.###and at that point, he has now graduated from warfare electronics school with honors.###speakerb85.###oh.###speakera86.###this is the kid who, who *t*-1 really, you know, barely made it through high school.###speakerb87.###yeah.###speakera88.###and i keep *-1 thinking, you know, it's not, it's really not too late *ich*-2 at any point * to do, you know, some-,###speakerb89.###that's interesting that the military saw that and did something about it.###speakera90.###yes.###speakerb91.###you would have expected them to be the last ones 0 *t*-1 to *?*.###speakera92.###yes.###and i kind of have always pooh-poohed military educations.###but i think that for this kid, it's going *-1 to be, you know, his lifesaver.
31362:38	that's, of course, that is certainly true,	certainly	###speakera100.###maybe adult literacy. maybe, you know, composition writing. maybe, you know, uh, * volunteering, you know, on a tutor line or though the, even through the elementary schools for help with homework###or, the other part of me says, is god, i've had enough kids.###do i reall-,.###speakerb101.###speakera1.###okay.###so, uh, what do you think *t*-1 about it?###speakerb2.###well, um, i guess 0 i, i'm more concerned about public safety than i am *?* about the, um, the concern for the private, uh, the idea of, * preserving privacy for, the individual, um,###speakera3.###privacy.###speakerb4.###speakera5.###right.###speakerb6.###because i can't really see why anyone, um, who *t*-1 has nothing 0 * to hide *t*-2 would object *t*-3.###speakera7.###well, there is always the, uh, the possibility, even remote as it is *?*, of, uh, of mistaken, uh, of,###speakerb8.
31414:37	i agree that, that some innocent person might be victimized *-1, by a false test,	might	###speakera23.###i mean i haven't had one yet.###um, t i,###i work for texas instruments###speakerb24.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera25.### and, and, uh, we, you know, we do have the random drug testing###but i've missed it so far.###but i mean, it, in the back of my mind, it always bothers me.###and what *t*-1 happens if it, you know, if it, if they catch it,###they think that i'm, you know, i'm on drugs###and they send me and, and have me, uh, you know, go through this, this, thing, you know,###speakerb26.###checked out or whatever.###speakera27.###yeah.###speakerb28.###but it *exp*-2 seems to me that there are ways 0 * to accommodate that *t*-1. um,
31419:81	for example, that one, uh, positive would not be, uh, accepted *-1 as an automatic, um, reason for whatever they might be going, *-2 to do *t*-6 if they found a positive, uh, dismissal or treatment or whatever, but that, that what it would do *t*-3 is it would trigger, perhaps, uh, one or two more stages where further tests could be ta-, uh, done *-4 *t*-5.	might	###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera25.### and, and, uh, we, you know, we do have the random drug testing###but i've missed it so far.###but i mean, it, in the back of my mind, it always bothers me.###and what *t*-1 happens if it, you know, if it, if they catch it,###they think that i'm, you know, i'm on drugs###and they send me and, and have me, uh, you know, go through this, this, thing, you know,###speakerb26.###checked out or whatever.###speakera27.###yeah.###speakerb28.###but it *exp*-2 seems to me that there are ways 0 * to accommodate that *t*-1. um,###i agree that, that some innocent person might be victimized *-1, by a false test,###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb30.###but i would think that, um, that some guidelines could be set *-1 up * to avoid that.
31427:38	on the other hand, um, i think 0 there's certainly some professions that *t*-1 ought *-2 to be tested *-3 because of the, of their responsibility for the public welfare, and certainly people in, uh, industries, well, the transportation industry, for spe-, uh, you know, specifically.	certainly	###and they send me and, and have me, uh, you know, go through this, this, thing, you know,###speakerb26.###checked out or whatever.###speakera27.###yeah.###speakerb28.###but it *exp*-2 seems to me that there are ways 0 * to accommodate that *t*-1. um,###i agree that, that some innocent person might be victimized *-1, by a false test,###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb30.###but i would think that, um, that some guidelines could be set *-1 up * to avoid that.###for example, that one, uh, positive would not be, uh, accepted *-1 as an automatic, um, reason for whatever they might be going, *-2 to do *t*-6 if they found a positive, uh, dismissal or treatment or whatever, but that, that what it would do *t*-3 is it would trigger, perhaps, uh, one or two more stages where further tests could be ta-, uh, done *-4 *t*-5.###speakera31.###right.###speakerb32.###speakera33.###uh-huh.###speakerb34.###because, um, there are, there must be people like you, or in other circumstances, that *t*-1 could come up with, with, uh, false positives for certain kind of drugs.

31437:179	but, um, in many, many cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs, it's not even going *-1 to effect anybody but his, uh, you know, himself and his own family, perhaps, um, depending on the kind of drug 0 he might be on *t*-2.	might	###speakerb30.###but i would think that, um, that some guidelines could be set *-1 up * to avoid that.###for example, that one, uh, positive would not be, uh, accepted *-1 as an automatic, um, reason for whatever they might be going, *-2 to do *t*-6 if they found a positive, uh, dismissal or treatment or whatever, but that, that what it would do *t*-3 is it would trigger, perhaps, uh, one or two more stages where further tests could be ta-, uh, done *-4 *t*-5.###speakera31.###right.###speakerb32.###speakera33.###uh-huh.###speakerb34.###because, um, there are, there must be people like you, or in other circumstances, that *t*-1 could come up with, with, uh, false positives for certain kind of drugs.###on the other hand, um, i think 0 there's certainly some professions that *t*-1 ought *-2 to be tested *-3 because of the, of their responsibility for the public welfare, and certainly people in, uh, industries, well, the transportation industry, for spe-, uh, you know, specifically.###speakera35.###oh, yeah.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###uh-huh.###speakerb38.###speakera39.###oh, yeah.###speakerb40.
31542:211	well, the limits, uh, uh, would, i think 0 *t*-5, have *-3 to do with what i'd alluded to *t*-1 before, that there needs *-6 to be a further, um, that, that one positive on a drug test, would not constitute, uh, dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might, uh, have *t*-4 set up for those who *t*-2 genuinely have a problem.	might	###i mean, he's, you know, he's so messed up.###speakera73.###right.###speakerb74.###and, um, this was a nice, sweet, young man who, teenager, you know,###and he's now a young man about twenty, i guess 0 *t*-2, who, um, *t*-1 just got really down the wrong path.###speakera75.###right.###speakerb76.###and, uh, you know, i don't know that, that his problem would ever have been detected *-1 by drug testing.###but * seeing what drugs did *t*-1 to him makes me see, makes me realize what it could do *t*-2 to people, you know, in the work force as well.###speakera77.###uh-huh.###speakerb78.###um, it's horrible.###speakera79.###well, then,###* let's, let's answer the second half of the question.###what limits *t*-1 ought *-2 to be put *-3 on it, do you think 0 *t*-4?###speakerb80.
31570:63	and people who *t*-1 are on medication, for example, or, um, even people who *t*-2 might be of the gay community,	might	###speakera85.###treatment before for dismissal type thing.###speakerb86.###pard-,###yes,###right,###speakera87.###yeah.###speakerb88.###there needs *-1 to be more than one test,###and there needs *-1 to be some, some measure of, uh, certainty before anything drastic happens.###speakera89.###uh-huh.###speakerb90.###there are lots of things that *t*-1 are involved *-2 there, um, such as, perhaps, insurance uh, you know, denial of insurance for someone, um,###speakera91.###uh-huh.###speakerb92.###and undoubtedly there are people who *t*-1 would be victimized *-2 by this, um, that *t*-3 would, that, you know,###it would be unfair,
31596:7	but certainly random testing, the fact that people know that, that they,	certainly	###because it makes a bigger problem. um,###so it seems to me that, that, um, there needs *-1 to be some ground, you know, some rules that *t*-2 protect.###speakera95.###uh-huh.###speakerb96.###i'm not sure *ich*-4, though, when we talk about what rules, if any *t*-3, that we should say, well, certain segments should not have *-1 to be tested *-2.###i really don't see why,###speakera97.###personally, i think 0 that's what i was about *-1 to say *t*-2 is that everyone needs *-3 to be tested *-4.###speakerb98.###and,###yeah.###speakera99.###speakerb100.###yeah.### i don't, i don't know why it *exp*-1 would be, you know, uh, bad * to test just every- *t*-2,###speakera101.###it, you know,###speakerb102.###and it *exp*-2 may be, you know, 0 it *exp*-1's not feasible * to do everyone,
31739:8	you might put them in the ground just the first week of june	might	###in cold frames or whatever the,###speakera25.###yeah,###well, we usually start them right in the house.###speakerb26.###uh-huh.###speakera27.###my sister tries *-1 to set up a greenhouse on her back deck### and, and the wi-, and a wind storm come and knock it down.###speakerb28.###huh.###speakera29.###but she's had really good luck.###i mean, i-, ca-,###next month,###well, actually, it, if you, if you start it in a couple weeks and you can get your plants outside, pretty much the end of may,###you can leave them outside.###speakerb30.###uh-huh.###speakera31.
31806:42	i'm, just wrote my resume up because told 0 we might be facing layoff over at digital	might	###yeah,###yeah.###speakera51.###but, um,###speakerb52.###yeah,### i had, i had a cousin that *t*-1 was stationed *-2 there, plattsburgh for a while.### he, he remembers lots of snow.###speakera53.###yeah,###plattsburgh's kind of a,### it's, uh, it's, uh, depressed economically.###speakerb54.###oh, really, oh.###speakera55.###when you go across the lake *t*-1, um,###i don't know why we have so much going for us *t*-1,###i really don't.###speakerb56.###speakera57.
32295:39	i guess 0 it, it, might would *?*,	might	###speakera57.###oh, i see.###speakerb58.###and so i,###speakera59.###okay.###we don't start anything indoors###we, just wait until, you know, the weather warm enough * to stick it in the ground.###speakerb60.###yeah.###speakera61.###speakerb62.### i, uh, i guess 0 you can get an earlier harvest by *-1 doing that,###speakera63.###probably so.###yeah,###you can get a head start on it.###speakerb64.###but, uh, * sure is a heck of a lot of work.###speakera65.
32597:46	and i'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe i won't have, oh, i'll have less of a bug problem	maybe	###yeah.###speakerb198.###and, uh,###speakera199.###i did something a little bit different *ich*-2 this year that i haven't done *t*-1 before,###i've got,###my garden is shaped *-1 that i can,###it's kind like this, uh, box shape,###so i got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just made a box. and put in a whole bunch like eight hundred pounds of topsoil and manure###speakerb200.###right.###speakera201.###and, you know, various other things,###* raised it up.###speakerb202.###well, the good stuff.###speakera203.###speakerb204.###right.###speakera205.
32697:8	it might be handy,	might	###speakerb240.###speakera241.###uh-huh.###it would be handy.###speakerb242.###and it weighs twenty pounds or, something like that.###speakera243.###yeah.###speakerb244.###my neighbor across the street has one.###he always uses it *-1 to dethatch his lawn,###speakera245.###uh-huh.###speakerb246.###i see him out there,###speakera247.###yeah.###speakerb248.###and i guess 0 it has a thatcher attachment to it.###speakera249.
33017:31	well, um, i think 0 it would probably depend on whether this was a formal *rnr*-1 or a informal *rnr*-1 dinner party.	probably	###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.###but when i do *t*-2 i try *-1 to keep it pretty simple on things that i can prepare *t*-3 ahead of time,###uh, i have one recipe for, uh, a really good, um, type of a meatball.###it's called *-1 burgundy meatball###and it's made *-1 with red wine and,###speakera5.###oh, gosh, that sounds great.###speakerb6.###um###speakera7.###speakerb8.### it's, it's really good###and you can make it ahead of time and then, um, make the sauce when you're ready * to, um, to serve it *t*-2.###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###that's one of my favorite things 0 * to, to serve *t*-1.###speakera11.
33031:32	but if it was a formal dinner party i would probably think of something else like, uh,	probably	###and you can make it ahead of time and then, um, make the sauce when you're ready * to, um, to serve it *t*-2.###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###that's one of my favorite things 0 * to, to serve *t*-1.###speakera11.###well, um, i think 0 it would probably depend on whether this was a formal *rnr*-1 or a informal *rnr*-1 dinner party.###speakerb12.###sure.###speakera13.###but if it was informal, my first choice would be crawfish.###speakerb14.###oh, really.###well, i guess 0 * being from that part of the country.###speakera15.###because, i mean, crawfish, everybody over here likes crawfish###but you know, i, i wouldn't have *-1 to worry about *-2 satisfying my guest.###speakerb16.###uh-huh.###speakera17.
33102:68	but, um, if it was more formal like if i was, you know, working environment then i would probably, um, sh-, shell'em or at least disconnect them from the head.	probably	###and you just boil them###and they're absolutely wonderful###but there's, uh, they're a pain 0 * to peel *t*-1 for some people.###once you get used to it they're real easy###but, um, you know, if you have nails or anything you can plan on those being shot.###speakerb38.###huh. when you were, um, whe-, when you serve it *t*-1 do you shell them and then serve em too?###speakera39.###i think 0 for a dinner party### i, i don't know###it depends.###speakerb40.###um-hum.###speakera41.###like if, like my age,###if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party, no, i, they would shell their own,###speakerb42.###sure.###speakera43.###you know, we'd just have crawfish and beer or something
33209:97	and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be ethnic food or um sometimes it would be um oh oh i don't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh elegant theme or you know	maybe	###it did###speakera85.###speakerb86.### we we tried *-1 to be fancier or more courses than the other###speakera87.###speakerb88.###speakera89.###speakerb90.###speakera91.###speakerb92.###speakera93.###speakerb94.###speakera95.###that would be fun###speakerb96.###or###speakera97.###speakerb98.###uh it was a lot of fun you know###it something unique you know
33215:11	sometimes it might be the candlelight	might	###speakera89.###speakerb90.###speakera91.###speakerb92.###speakera93.###speakerb94.###speakera95.###that would be fun###speakerb96.###or###speakera97.###speakerb98.###uh it was a lot of fun you know###it something unique you know###and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be ethnic food or um sometimes it would be um oh oh i don't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh elegant theme or you know###speakera99.###uh huh###speakerb100.###it was a lot of fun###speakera101.
33216:13	and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something	might	###speakerb90.###speakera91.###speakerb92.###speakera93.###speakerb94.###speakera95.###that would be fun###speakerb96.###or###speakera97.###speakerb98.###uh it was a lot of fun you know###it something unique you know###and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be ethnic food or um sometimes it would be um oh oh i don't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh elegant theme or you know###speakera99.###uh huh###speakerb100.###it was a lot of fun###speakera101.###sometimes it might be the candlelight
33241:27	except that * knowing them they would probably do something ridiculous and terrible just just *-1 to uh make * sure that they didn't have *-2 to do it again	probably	###speakera105.###well that's you know that's fun###speakerb106.###speakera107.###speakerb108.###it was fun### and and we threatened *-1 to make the other two uh make us dinner one time uh just *-3 to even it out since we seemed *-2 to be unfairly doing all the cooking and they were doing all the enjoying###speakera109.###uh huh###speakerb110.###speakera111.###speakerb112.###speakera113.###that sounds right### i would i'd take him up on that###speakerb114.###i'm###speakera115.###speakerb116.###it does
33365:4	probably you have *-1 to heat it up for a good oh	probably	###speakerb168.###and it gives it a bit of a different consistency###speakera169.###well um how long do you cook the meatballs *t*-1###speakerb170.###the meatballs you just um after you form them * fry them in a pan until they're uh browned on all all sides###speakera171.###uh huh###speakerb172.###and then * drain off all the grease###uh then what i usually do *t*-1 is i freeze them###and then when you're ready *-1 to serve them *t*-2 then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce and heat it###speakera173.###speakerb174.###speakera175.###oh###speakerb176.###speakera177.###yeah###speakerb178.
33686:11	that's probably the safer way	probably	###oh, goodness.###speakerb74.###speakera75.###uh-huh.###speakerb76.###i can't do any jumping up and down because it makes it hurt.###speakera77.###oh, that makes sense.###so, i mean, are you, in terms of other things, like, like, not running, but playing a little bit of tennis,### or can you not do stuff like that at all?###speakerb78.###uh, well i haven't tried that.###i don't know.### it's been i bet 0 it's been thirty years since i played tennis.###speakera79.###yeah.###it's been,###speakerb80.###mostly into just walking and stuff like that.###speakera81.
33727:31	and at first after it happened i thought, maybe that's a handicap access,	maybe	###speakerb90.###sure.###speakera91.###um, but when i see some wo-,###i mean, and i just don't think 0 it's healthy###all that pounding all the time.###speakerb92.### it isn't, really, it's not really good for your knees.###speakera93.###so, yeah,###that's the other reason,###and, i don't know,###this was just, i guess 0 *t*-2, something freak that *t*-1 happened to me,###because i wasn't familiar with the,###speakerb94.###well, the floor was uneven.###speakera95.###oh, it was completely,###i mean, it literally,###the two dissimilar floor lev-, floor coverings were not level.
33799:5	maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being.	maybe	###and i need all the help 0 i can get *t*-1.###speakera113.###that gravity factor,###i know.###speakerb114.###uh-huh.###it does get you.###speakera115.###like that orthopedist said to me, he said, * don't worry diane,### he says, he said, uh, you're at thirty something,###but you're on the upper side.###he said that, * don't worry,###he says, 0 even if you weren't doing anything your body would start, that would start *-1 to happen to you.###speakerb116.###yeah,###thanks a lot.###speakera117.###yeah,###because i was saying to him, i said, i'm not that heavy,###i'm not heavy, you know,
33837:23	i've been there like, maybe a dozen times.	maybe	###except for the guys that *t*-1 lift the weights.###they do intimidate.###speakerb126.###yeah.###i try *-1 to go real late or real early before they get there.###speakera127.###yeah.###there some things 0 i'd like *-1 to try *t*-2,###but, you know, sometime when i ask *t*-1, i just feel like, boy, am i stupid or what.###speakerb128.###uh-huh.###well that's one thing 0 i like *t*-1 about the spring creek place.###at least the fellow that *t*-2's there, one of the fellows that *t*-1's there at night and on weekends is real helpful.###speakera129.###uh-huh.###speakerb130.###and his name is b j.###speakera131.### i don't think 0 i've ever, i think 0 i've,###there was some girl there.
33867:15	i thought 0 maybe one of these days i'll drive over there and check it out.	maybe	###it just seems that,###um, sometimes i feel like i'm in a singles bar.###speakerb136.###yeah,###yeah,###that's true.###and i haven't noticed that up at spring creek.###speakera137.###no,###i haven't either,###and i just, uh,###it's not that far of a drive###and i'm glad 0 they did that.###um, you're not missing anything at the dallas renovated site.###it's not at all anything worth * talking about *?*.###speakerb138.###yeah.###speakera139.###speakerb140.###yeah.
33893:50	but he, he kind of said something *ich*-1 to me about probably not as bad as your foot,	probably	###i live in richardson,###but it's about half way between the spring creek and the, the dallas site.###speakera143.###yeah.###that's actually where this happened to me, out in, i say *rnr*-1 plano *t*-2,###but it's all the same to me.###richardson, over on campbell and park hill there's a new recreation center.###speakerb144.###uh-huh.###speakera145.###and as we were doing it, too, everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities.###mumblex walked out,###i was one thing,###oh great, i have purple tights on, you know.###speakerb146.###uh-huh.###speakera147.###and they're going yes.###but in general i like * to exer-, i, i like dance a lot,###so i mean aerobics is something 0 i'd hate *-2 to give *t*-1 up.
33894:25	but he just said to me, maybe you ought *-1 to try bicycling	maybe	###but it's about half way between the spring creek and the, the dallas site.###speakera143.###yeah.###that's actually where this happened to me, out in, i say *rnr*-1 plano *t*-2,###but it's all the same to me.###richardson, over on campbell and park hill there's a new recreation center.###speakerb144.###uh-huh.###speakera145.###and as we were doing it, too, everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities.###mumblex walked out,###i was one thing,###oh great, i have purple tights on, you know.###speakerb146.###uh-huh.###speakera147.###and they're going yes.###but in general i like * to exer-, i, i like dance a lot,###so i mean aerobics is something 0 i'd hate *-2 to give *t*-1 up.###but he, he kind of said something *ich*-1 to me about probably not as bad as your foot,

33962:18	uh, the ammunition is probably so old 0 i'm afraid *-1 to use it.	probably	###speakera163.###okay,###* thank you, sandy.###speakerb164.###sure,###thanks.###speakera165.###uh-huh.###bye-bye.###speakera1.###uh, well what would you say 0 your opinion *ich*-2 is *t*-1 on gun control?###speakerb2.###well, i don't know.### i've, i've had mixed emotions *ich*-4, i guess 0 *t*-3, when i listen to, uh, the radio and, and watch t v *t*-2 about the different, uh, things that *t*-1 are happening.###uh, i'm against it###but on the same token, uh, i went out and purchased a gun just because i wanted the right * to do that.###speakera3.###ye-,###speakerb4.###so i, i have a rifle in the house.
33981:34	and like you, my bullets to my little pistol's probably, uh, about three years old.	probably	###so i, i have a rifle in the house.###uh, the ammunition is probably so old 0 i'm afraid *-1 to use it.###but, uh, i bought it for target practicing and, uh, and also because i wanted a weapon.###uh, how do you feel about it *t*-1?###speakera5.###well, i think, uh, 0 down here in texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns.###speakerb6.###huh.###speakera7.###and, i think 0 they need that.###uh, and i do have a, i have a pistol.###it's a little twenty-two###and i have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun.###speakerb8.###uh-huh.###speakera9.###an-, you know, i do like *-1 to have my guns.###speakerb10.###speakera11.###uh, i don't know if i'll ever use it, you know.
34010:180	i think, you know, 0 one of the things that, that, that *t*-1 needs *-2 to happen is, uh, * to, to stop the impulse buyer from, uh, *-3 buying it quickly and, and, uh, maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it.	maybe	###and i think 0 if they, uh,###speakera15.###speakerb16.###* takes two weeks for that system to process, uh, your request for, uh, not as a gun permit but, uh, but * to buy ammunition.###you have *-1 to get a permit from the police station in your local area *-1 to do that.###speakera17.###i've never heard of anything like that.###speakerb18.###yeah.###uh,###speakera19.###that would be nice.###but, a-, you know,###speakerb20.###speakera21.###the criminals that *t*-2 are going *-1 to get their guns one way or the other.###speakerb22.### i i, i agree.###speakera23.###speakerb24.

34266:8	they probably do.	probably	###and everything about you.###speakerb112.###and, that's true.###speakera113.###uh, i,### bu-, bu-, you know, they know so, how much money *ich*-2 you make *t*-1 a week to, uh, probably your, uh,###my kid is banging.###i was seeing what they was banging on *t*-1.###uh, i've lost my train of thought.###i'm sorry.###speakerb114.###that's all right.### you, you were talking about, uh, uh, fed-, what *ich*-2 the federal government knows *t*-1 about people.###speakera115.###oh, the soc-,###speakerb116.###speakera117.###yeah.### they, they probably know everything from *ich*-2, half the time wh-, ho-, what time you go to the bathroom *t*-1.###speakerb118.
34331:35	i'm s-, i shouldn't probably say control.	probably	###speakera135.###no.###none whatsoever.###speakerb136.###speakera137.###you call,###we sold a refrigerator through it###and it took us all of twelve hours.###speakerb138.###* to sell the refrigerator?###speakera139.###yeah.###speakerb140.###yeah.###speakera141.###you know. and i'm sure 0 it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun.###speakerb142.###huh.###and i think 0 the federal government is, uh, is really far away from, uh, uh, control.### i, i don't believe in, uh,
34605:5	maybe it's just the idea of my reaction to the first time.	maybe	###probably the last comedy 0 we saw *t*-1, now that i think about it, is home alone.###speakera91.###yes,### i, i, i had seen it before christmas,###but i took a date to it, uh, about a month ago.###so, i, i, i've seen it the second time not too long ago.###so.###speakerb92.###it was really cute.###speakera93.###i really enjoyed it.###speakerb94.###speakera95.###of course, the bad thing about it was, uh, 0 the second time 0 i saw it *t*-1, i didn't really enjoy it as much,###and i was kind of surprised at that.###i thought 0 that would be one of those that i would love *-1 to watch *t*-2 over and over.###speakerb96.###yeah.###speakera97.###but before,
34615:7	and maybe i just laughed so hard *ich*-1 the first time that i didn't have it,	maybe	###i really enjoyed it.###speakerb94.###speakera95.###of course, the bad thing about it was, uh, 0 the second time 0 i saw it *t*-1, i didn't really enjoy it as much,###and i was kind of surprised at that.###i thought 0 that would be one of those that i would love *-1 to watch *t*-2 over and over.###speakerb96.###yeah.###speakera97.###but before,###maybe it's just the idea of my reaction to the first time.###i had laughed so hard 0 i was hoarse.###speakerb98.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera99.### i really was, i was hoarse *-1 getting out of there.###speakerb100.###yeah.###speakera101.
34624:5	maybe so.	maybe	###but before,###maybe it's just the idea of my reaction to the first time.###i had laughed so hard 0 i was hoarse.###speakerb98.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera99.### i really was, i was hoarse *-1 getting out of there.###speakerb100.###yeah.###speakera101.###and maybe i just laughed so hard *ich*-1 the first time that i didn't have it,###i mean, it just wasn't as funny the second time because i had just gone overboard the first time.###speakerb102.###right.###speakera103.###i don't know###but,###speakerb104.###maybe so,
34918:7	so probably everything 0 i going *-1 to say *t*-2 is kind of dated.	probably	###i know it.###isn't that ridiculous.###we have cable which *t*-1 helps a lot.###speakera217.###oh, i do too.###speakerb218.###speakera219.###yeah,###but not enough.###speakerb220.###yeah,###we keep *-1 holding out, you know.###speakera221.###yeah###i'm getting to the point where, you know, i watch, well i watch nick at night *t*-1.###speakerb1.###well i haven't had too much of a chance * to watch t v lately.###speakera2.###yeah.###speakerb3.
35060:18	none of it's probably damaging, lot of times.	probably	###speakerb53.###uh-huh.###speakera54.###the whole moral situation, everything, is just gone one whole complete direction different.###and we don't have any kids yet,###but i feel the same way.###it *exp*-3's really tough * to find something *ich*-4 that *t*-1's going *-2 to be good and interesting for the kids. even, even cartoons,###um###speakerb55.###right.###speakera56.###speakerb57.###oh.###speakera58.###you know, you watch some of the cartoons,###and kids aren't, aren't even going *-2 to understand half the humor that *t*-1's in there.###speakerb59.###yeah.###speakera60.###it's,
35149:47	if half of the time wasn't spent *-1 * watching commercials, it probably wouldn't be so bad.	probably	###the children's program i think 0 *t*-3 at the time was called *-2 what *t*-1's new.###speakera86.###okay,###yeah.###speakerb87.###so we had *-1 to give a little oral report before we could watch our program.###speakera88.###yeah,###yeah.###that's pretty good.###speakerb89.### do you, do you watch sports on t v?###are you a sports fan?###speakera90.###i can't handle it very long.###speakerb91.###yeah.###speakera92.### i, i mean, i'm, i'm a sports fan,###but it's, well, it's kind of, it's kind of like * reading magazines any more.
35418:33	and then the cadillac is, is definitely a used car	definitely	###speakerb32.###oh yeah.###speakera33.###so it's, i think 0 it's a pretty good option.###speakerb34.###yeah,###i think so too.###speakera35.###are the, uh, oldsmobiles that you're looking at *t*-1, are they the demos###or they used,###are they new.###speakerb36.###well, the ones that we were test driving *t*-1 were the, uh, were the new ones there.###speakera37.###uh-huh.###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###well now, uh, now, they may be the demonstrator models that the sales reps drive around in *t*-1.###speakera39.###uh-huh.
35426:21	he says 0 it'll probably be gone in a done,	probably	###are the, uh, oldsmobiles that you're looking at *t*-1, are they the demos###or they used,###are they new.###speakerb36.###well, the ones that we were test driving *t*-1 were the, uh, were the new ones there.###speakera37.###uh-huh.###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###well now, uh, now, they may be the demonstrator models that the sales reps drive around in *t*-1.###speakera39.###uh-huh.###and then the cadillac is, is definitely a used car###or,###speakerb40.###yeah.###speakera41.###uh-huh.###speakerb42.###the guy said 0 it'd been on the lot about thirty minutes.
35427:13	and it's probably gone by now.	probably	###or they used,###are they new.###speakerb36.###well, the ones that we were test driving *t*-1 were the, uh, were the new ones there.###speakera37.###uh-huh.###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###well now, uh, now, they may be the demonstrator models that the sales reps drive around in *t*-1.###speakera39.###uh-huh.###and then the cadillac is, is definitely a used car###or,###speakerb40.###yeah.###speakera41.###uh-huh.###speakerb42.###the guy said 0 it'd been on the lot about thirty minutes.###he says 0 it'll probably be gone in a done,
35451:40	or do i look for a used car that *t*-1's maybe two, three years old that but that *t*-2's, you know, low mileage and in good shape.	maybe	###those things go fast.###speakera45.###uh-huh.###speakerb46.###uh, of course we're not, we can't consider *-1 getting a brand new cadillac, because those are twenty-five to thirty thousand dollars.###speakera47.###yeah.###speakerb48.###but when they're three years old *t*-1 they're,###the price already drops in half.###speakera49.###uh-huh.###speakerb50.###so then it becomes, uh, more realistic.###speakera51.###right.###that's what i'm thinking about *t*-1 on my next car is do i want *-2 to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new###speakerb52.###uh-huh.###speakera53.
35577:39	because one of these days i'll be getting a six seater probably too.	probably	###speakera97.###in fact it never has *?*###speakerb98.###that's right.###speakera99.###and, uh, it's been kind of nice,###and i, surprisingly enough after four years, i'm not tired of the car at all###and i want *-1 to hang on to it while it's still being a good car and while i'm not tired of it and while i'm single and can handle a two seater for now and get that out of my system.###speakerb100.###well.###speakera101.###speakerb102.###yeah.###speakera103.###speakerb104.###that's right.###speakera105.###speakerb106.###that's right.###speakera107.
35651:11	that's probably the best thing.	probably	###or,###speakerb130.###no,###my fiance is selling, uh, a nineteen seventy-eight cutlass supreme that she has *t*-1.###it's actually, in better condition than my car.###speakera131.###okay.###speakerb132.###speakera133.###uh-huh.###speakerb134.###and so she's going *-1 to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try *-2 to make as much down payment as possible *-2 to keep the monthly payment low.###speakera135.###uh-huh.###speakerb136.###speakera137.###so she's going *-1 to sell it rather than trade it in.###speakerb138.###yeah.###speakera139.
35655:7	or maybe more than that, as i've learned.	maybe	###it's actually, in better condition than my car.###speakera131.###okay.###speakerb132.###speakera133.###uh-huh.###speakerb134.###and so she's going *-1 to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try *-2 to make as much down payment as possible *-2 to keep the monthly payment low.###speakera135.###uh-huh.###speakerb136.###speakera137.###so she's going *-1 to sell it rather than trade it in.###speakerb138.###yeah.###speakera139.###that's probably the best thing.###speakerb140.###you lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in.###speakera141.
35684:19	and i think, 0 maybe, as you get outside the dallas area,	maybe	###oh there you go.###speakera145.###you can do much better.###i'm glad 0 you're, you're taking care of it yourself.### i, i think 0 * trading it in, they just use that as additional,###they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car 0 you're buying *t*-1,###but they just, are going *-1 to give you that much less for your trade in.###speakerb146.###well that's fact.###speakera147.###what i think *t*-1.###so,###speakerb148.###i think 0 you're right.###speakera149.###but strangely enough, the best off-, i mean, the best bargaining 0 i had made *t*-1 with a dealer on my car was also the same place 0 i got the best price trade in *t*-2,###speakerb150.###interesting.###speakera151.###but it's a place in arlington,
35687:10	well, maybe because it's outside of dallas they are giving a little bit better prices,	maybe	###i'm glad 0 you're, you're taking care of it yourself.### i, i think 0 * trading it in, they just use that as additional,###they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car 0 you're buying *t*-1,###but they just, are going *-1 to give you that much less for your trade in.###speakerb146.###well that's fact.###speakera147.###what i think *t*-1.###so,###speakerb148.###i think 0 you're right.###speakera149.###but strangely enough, the best off-, i mean, the best bargaining 0 i had made *t*-1 with a dealer on my car was also the same place 0 i got the best price trade in *t*-2,###speakerb150.###interesting.###speakera151.###but it's a place in arlington,###and i think, 0 maybe, as you get outside the dallas area,###i kind of,###i bet you 0 it's kind of what i decided *t*-1.
35761:23	and i'm sure 0 he probably knew what *t*-1 was going on the very next day	probably	###speakera175.###yeah,###well, unless you're selling car with hail damage and flood damage, i got the car off your lot for that price.###speakerb176.###and you laughed all the way to the bank.###speakera177.###oh i did.###and i laughed real hard when i took it in for the two thousand mile checkup *t*-1###speakerb178.###uh-huh.###speakera179.###and, uh, that they required you to do *t*-1.###and i took it to town north,###and sure enough i saw that guy,###and he recognized me.###speakerb180.###yeah.###speakera181.###he said, oh, hi, dana,###and he kind of looked down and saw that car,
35989:32	and, and there's probably, there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent * on the bureaucracy.	probably	###they get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games you know,###speakerb68.###yeah.###speakera69.###and i'm, i jus-, i have a hard time *-1 dealing with that.###speakerb70.###what i hear *t*-1 one time, i think 0 it was on paul harvey's, uh, radio segment, that he said that if the money that *t*-2 goes into welfare each year was *-3 to be given *-4 directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy, each person would receive like forty-five thousand dollars *t*-5.###speakera71.###uh-huh.###speakerb72.###i mean, i was astounded *-1.###i don't even make that.###speakera73.###no,###i know.### i, you, you think about, you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient,###speakerb74.###yeah,###and somebody's taking that away.###speakera75.
35989:51	and, and there's probably, there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent * on the bureaucracy.	probably	###they get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games you know,###speakerb68.###yeah.###speakera69.###and i'm, i jus-, i have a hard time *-1 dealing with that.###speakerb70.###what i hear *t*-1 one time, i think 0 it was on paul harvey's, uh, radio segment, that he said that if the money that *t*-2 goes into welfare each year was *-3 to be given *-4 directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy, each person would receive like forty-five thousand dollars *t*-5.###speakera71.###uh-huh.###speakerb72.###i mean, i was astounded *-1.###i don't even make that.###speakera73.###no,###i know.### i, you, you think about, you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient,###speakerb74.###yeah,###and somebody's taking that away.###speakera75.
36092:49	i think that if, uh, young people had service to the country * might give them more ambition. because they learn that * serving other people is a good thing.	might	###and now we're no-, we're not going *-1 to do it because everybody is beating us at the game.###we taught them how * to do it *t*-1,###and they, they did it better than we do.###speakerb106.###yeah###speakera107.###simple as that.###speakerb108.###because they have the ambition, i guess *t*-1.###speakera109.###yeah,###simple as that.###speakerb110.###yeah,###which *t*-1 is good for them,###but on the other hand, we kind of lose out.###speakera111.###yeah,###it's terrible for us.###speakerb112.
36139:32	that was a lot, that's probably the most fun 0 i had *t*-1.	probably	###yeah.###speakera125.###yeah,###uh, that's my other complaint.###parents aren't parents any more.###speakerb126.###no.### they've, they've relinquished their parenting.###speakera127.###yeah.###one of the other subjects is do you think 0 the public school systems are in trouble?###speakerb128.###yeah.###speakera129.###well, as a substitute teacher for a year, i, i can say yes.###speakerb130.###yeah,###i mean, i talked with somebody else about that another time,###and, you know, when i's in graduate school *-1 working on my master's degree in math *t*-2, i was, uh, teaching as part of my, part of the program.###and i just love *-1 teaching.
36480:20	maybe it, maybe it speeded up the process and all that.	maybe	###so i've calmed down everything except, i was working out doing aerobic exercises as well as the, um, walking,###speakera55.###yeah.###speakerb56.###and i had *-1 to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of painful.###but the t i rec center has an aerobics program for, for, um, prenatal and postnatal aerobic type thing.###speakera57.###um.###speakerb58.###and i was going *-1 to wait until, um, about my sixth month and then start that.###i did that with the second baby,###and, um, i went to my exercise class one day,###and then she was delivered *-1 the next day.###speakera59.###gosh.###speakerb60.###so, it would seem *-1 to be real beneficial.###speakera61.###uh-huh,###yeah.
36783:5	maybe in the backyard,	maybe	###speakera49.###mumblex###they work,###but they're suppose *-1 to work really well.###speakerb50.###huh.###speakera51.###oh, i'm in my paperwork here,###that's what i do *t*-1 when i wait for a phone call *t*-2,###i get in my paperwork. oh, *-1 to find my most important parts.###but i don't know, i don't know if i'm going *-1 to go,###i wish was an avid camper###and i could really talk about like gardening or something,###you can talk about that a lot,###speakerb52.###uh-huh.###speakera53.###but, um, i do want *-1 to go again.###we just moved to a new hou-, into a house,###so, i don't think 0 camping,
36784:35	but i don't see *-1 going on a camping trip probably until next summer.	probably	###mumblex###they work,###but they're suppose *-1 to work really well.###speakerb50.###huh.###speakera51.###oh, i'm in my paperwork here,###that's what i do *t*-1 when i wait for a phone call *t*-2,###i get in my paperwork. oh, *-1 to find my most important parts.###but i don't know, i don't know if i'm going *-1 to go,###i wish was an avid camper###and i could really talk about like gardening or something,###you can talk about that a lot,###speakerb52.###uh-huh.###speakera53.###but, um, i do want *-1 to go again.###we just moved to a new hou-, into a house,###so, i don't think 0 camping,###maybe in the backyard,
37032:11	that's probably more true than, a lot of people realize.	probably	###i mean, he's been through it.###so i have no doubt that he'll,###i mean, i, i think 0 overall he's been a, a, good figure for the soviet union.###i mean, i think 0 his intentions and his ideals are, are uh, well intentioned.###speakera37.###uh-huh.###speakerb38.###and in the long-term,###but i just think that because of the basic needs that the people don't have *t*-1,###i think 0 that, uh, makes the problem most severe, and makes him look, look worse that what his, um, what his ideals are *t*-1, personally.###speakera39.###speakerb40.###speakera41.###i agree.###what *t*-1's bad for the soviet system is that, they have the resources 0 * to grow and produce their food *t*-2, but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way 0 it should *?* *t*-1.###speakerb42.### i think 0 it's, i think 0 it's a lot of, uh, oh, how do you put it *t*-1?, bureaucracy and, and, uh, one thing, and then all the corruption.###i think 0 there's a, a large amount of corruption on the, the have and the have-nots. you know,###speakera43.###yeah.
37063:5	probably not enough,	probably	###speakerb48.### and, but if it gets to a point where people can't, survive *t*-1, i mean, there's revolution. you know,###and that's,###speakera49.###it seems *-1 to be headed *-2 in that direction too.###speakerb50.###yeah,###big time,###major,###but you know, that's, that's what *t*-1 happens when, you know, the cork blows *t*-2 and you can't handle it anymore.###i mean, that's that's the way 0 the world, uh, you know, revolves that way *t*-1.###speakera51.###uh-huh. well, their knowledge, with, uh, better communication processes in this world now 0 that's reached them is more educated than to the, uh, ways of the western world,###speakerb52.###anyway, i really question, though, how much technology the average soviet is exposed *-1 to *t*-2.###speakera53.###and uh, i think 0 that was a big stepping stone for them to initiate all their righteous ways of * changing things, too.###speakerb54.###speakera55.###they,
37127:30	this is, this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female.	probably	###speakerb70.###um, no.###speakera71.###speakerb72.###well, i don't really feel that the soviets really want *-1 to blow up the world.###i mean, um, we painted them back in the fifties and sixties as, as nonfeeling machine type people,###and they're people just like us.###i mean you know, they get up everyday,###speakera73.###uh-huh.###speakerb74.###and they put their pants on the same way,###and they have *-1 to eat and everything else,###and i just don't feel that...###speakera1.###well i wondered if i was going *-1 to get *-2 to talk to a male or a female on this type.###speakerb2.###have you been talking to males?###yeah,###yeah,
37129:21	i was afraid 0 we might get into an argument.	might	###speakera71.###speakerb72.###well, i don't really feel that the soviets really want *-1 to blow up the world.###i mean, um, we painted them back in the fifties and sixties as, as nonfeeling machine type people,###and they're people just like us.###i mean you know, they get up everyday,###speakera73.###uh-huh.###speakerb74.###and they put their pants on the same way,###and they have *-1 to eat and everything else,###and i just don't feel that...###speakera1.###well i wondered if i was going *-1 to get *-2 to talk to a male or a female on this type.###speakerb2.###have you been talking to males?###yeah,###yeah,### this is, this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female.###speakera3.
37133:39	well, uh, i guess uh, 0 there have been certainly a lot of changes *ich*-1 in the last couple of generations, for, uh, the roles of women	certainly	###and they're people just like us.###i mean you know, they get up everyday,###speakera73.###uh-huh.###speakerb74.###and they put their pants on the same way,###and they have *-1 to eat and everything else,###and i just don't feel that...###speakera1.###well i wondered if i was going *-1 to get *-2 to talk to a male or a female on this type.###speakerb2.###have you been talking to males?###yeah,###yeah,### this is, this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female.###speakera3.###i was afraid 0 we might get into an argument.###speakerb4.###right.###speakera5.
37137:30	and uh, i guess 0 the most significant probably is that so many are working now, and trying *-1 to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities, you know,	probably	###speakerb74.###and they put their pants on the same way,###and they have *-1 to eat and everything else,###and i just don't feel that...###speakera1.###well i wondered if i was going *-1 to get *-2 to talk to a male or a female on this type.###speakerb2.###have you been talking to males?###yeah,###yeah,### this is, this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female.###speakera3.###i was afraid 0 we might get into an argument.###speakerb4.###right.###speakera5.###well, uh, i guess uh, 0 there have been certainly a lot of changes *ich*-1 in the last couple of generations, for, uh, the roles of women###speakerb6.###uh-huh.###speakera7.
37268:26	that, that's definitely true.	definitely	###yeah.###speakera53.###you know, the money was the issue.###speakerb54.###speakera55.###but, uh, even now, i would, i would like *-1 to not have *-2 to work in some ways.###speakerb56.###right.###speakera57.### it, it's kind of pull and tug,###speakerb58.###yeah.###speakera59.###on the other hand, i can't imagine *-1 just being at home, uh, although i have a lot of interests and a lot of things 0 i would like *-2 to pursue *t*-3.###speakerb60.###uh-huh.###speakera61.###uh, still, uh, there's, there's sort of a feeling of accomplishment with * having, you know, a job and all that *t*-1 goes with that.###speakerb62.###no,
37401:70	eve-, every once in a while, i will keep in, in touch, with maybe, like who *t*-1's in the top five of hitting, or something like that	maybe	###well what are the others *t*-1?###speakera3.###well, uh, i originally came from saint louis,###so, uh, the saint louis cardinals are one, uh,###i moved to kansas city,###see i have, i have a tendency * to, a, adopt teams when i wen-, go to a tea-, uh, go to a town *t*-1.###speakerb4.###well it's helpful.###speakera5.###yeah,###so, uh, i lived in kansas city for a couple years###and i adopted the royals,###i lived in houston for two and a half years###so i adopted the, uh, uh, the houston astros,###so i mean, you know, i've got quite a few.###speakerb6.###well do you keep up with the statistical stuff?###speakera7.###no,### i don't, i don't get into that too much,
37503:58	but i mean if you can't do it with men on base, there's something definitely wrong, um, you know,	definitely	### he can, he can stri-, he can swing a couple times, mumblex###if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can *?*.###speakera31.###right.###speakerb32.###it's an interesting, uh, an interesting concept of, of how they do it *t*-1.###but i agree with you### i think 0 that, i think 0 that's part of what, uh, baseball needs more of *t*-1.### i, uh, i, i guess 0 what *t*-1 bothers me is, is that when you go *t*-2, um, you wait and wait and wait###and finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run###and that's all 0 the game is *t*-1.###i'd rather see the ball hit *-1 around and have the people,###speakera33.###yeah,###well there's, there's another point to that too.###they said the, that um, that he was horrible at, uh, at *-1 batting with, with men on base.###now * having somebody get up and hit a solo home run does you, you know, gives you run, obviously.###speakerb34.###yes.###speakera35.
37530:37	and they're, uh, they're certainly intense about the cardinals	certainly	###i think 0 the royals will do okay.### they have, they have several pitchers that *t*-1 had badly years last year###and they are, they're these, uh, cycle pitchers,### they, they pitch one year bad, one year good, one beer bad, one year good.###saberhagen has won, uh, supposedly the cy,###i think 0 he won cy year, uh, two *rnr*-1 out of three *rnr*-1 years,### and, uh, you know, so he's very much due for a good year.###speakerb38.###well are they going *-1 to beat, are they going *-2 to beat oakland?###speakera39.###well now see that's a good question,### i, that's, i don't know how oakland's going *-1 to react to *-2 being, uh, swept *-3 in the world series last year *t*-4.###they could very easily, uh, take that as a challenge. which *t*-1 is the way 0 most teams nat-, you know, naturally do *t*-2. uh, and, and, just go out and not give anybody a chance * to beat them,###speakerb40.###yeah.###speakera41.###so,###speakerb42.###well i go to saint louis from time to time###and i watch, i, i watch their sports up there
37569:23	i, i definitely do,	definitely	###speakerb50.###i had a friend from college that *t*-1 lives in, uh,###mumblex###it's well, i should say 0 *t*-1 on the west side,###i mean everything's on the west side.###manchester?###speakera51.###uh-huh.###speakerb52.###uh, out that way,###speakera53.###um.###speakerb54.###and i went and visited him,###but anyway, it is interesting.###well how are the cardinals *t*-1?###do you still keep up with them, or someth-,###speakera55.###yeah,###oh yeah,
37580:68	but if they were, uh, playing the people that they're going *-1 to play *t*-2, then that might be pretty good indication,	might	###um.###speakerb54.###and i went and visited him,###but anyway, it is interesting.###well how are the cardinals *t*-1?###do you still keep up with them, or someth-,###speakera55.###yeah,###oh yeah,### i, i definitely do,###in fact i've got family that *t*-1 still lives up there.###um, from what i hear *t*-1 from everybody up there, they're not going *-2 to have a good year because they let too many people go.###but i've been following spring training###and they're like one of the best teams in spring training so far.###speakerb56.###well is that a good indicator?###speakera57.### that, well it can be *?*.### it, it really kind of depends on, on, um, what they were, you know, what they were looking for *t*-1.###in other words, if, if in spring cra-, training they were looking at all their kids, like a lot of them do, um, then it really doesn't give you any indication.
37635:16	um, that's probably true.	probably	###they are going with their farm system.###they're letting their farm system, uh, build up and stuff like that###and,###speakerb70.###well is there enough money,###that's part of it,###i, uh,###that was part of skip bayless' argument.###speakera71.###uh-huh.###speakerb72.###i don't know if you read skip bayless, but a, a local commentary###speakera73.###no.###speakerb74.###and, his argument is that uh, the ownership is not inclined *-1 to lose big money long enough *-2 to, to bring in the big dollars.###speakera75.###uh-huh.###speakerb76.###speakera77.
37668:41	well and that, i think 0 that's maybe part of it that, that the, um,	maybe	###speakerb82.###yeah.###speakera83.###and i think 0 that's really what *t*-1's been hurting, uh, the, uh, rangers.###speakerb84.###well didn't kansas city put up quite a bit of money for their pitching staff.###speakera85.###oh yeah,### they, they spent more money *ich*-1, last year than any other team in the, in the league###speakerb86.###speakera87.###and they were, you know, toward the bottom of the league.###uh, so it's like i said###* spending money doesn't guarantee you, uh, winning a pennant.###speakerb88.###yeah.###speakera89.###it really doesn't,###so.###speakerb90.
37684:95	and, uh, you know, i mean, i, i guess 0 as we get older, i-, you're probably going,	probably	###speakera89.###it really doesn't,###so.###speakerb90.###well and that, i think 0 that's maybe part of it that, that the, um,###and it, you know,###if i owned the team. i think 0 *t*-1 you'd like them to do well###but the question of * losing big, big money that###what, did, did, did steinbrenner actually make money on the,###speakera91.###uh, you got me.### i, you know, i think that there's coming to a point *ich*-1 real soon when ticket prices are going *-2 to be to the point where the average fan can't go *t*-3 *t*-4###and once you do that, you lose everything,###i mean.###speakerb92.###well it's, it, it, yeah, it's a little bit like any other sport, you know.###when it *exp*-2 starts *-3 costing you fifty or a hundred dollars * to go to a game *t*-1###speakera93.###uh-huh.###speakerb94.
37695:75	an i, i, i would, i would think 0 baseball probably feeds on a number of people that *t*-1 can go out there, you know, several times a,	probably	### i, you know, i think that there's coming to a point *ich*-1 real soon when ticket prices are going *-2 to be to the point where the average fan can't go *t*-3 *t*-4###and once you do that, you lose everything,###i mean.###speakerb92.###well it's, it, it, yeah, it's a little bit like any other sport, you know.###when it *exp*-2 starts *-3 costing you fifty or a hundred dollars * to go to a game *t*-1###speakera93.###uh-huh.###speakerb94.###and, uh, you know, i mean, i, i guess 0 as we get older, i-, you're probably going,### if, if you, if you compare * to go to a, a sport, a, a###* say 0 you go to a rock concert, or, or even a performance, a, an opera or the symphony or something, uh,###speakera95.###uh-huh.###speakerb96.###if, you know, i-,###but how, how often do you do that *t*-1.###speakera97.###right.###speakerb98.
37753:49	and, you know, and they're being paid *-1, probably half what most people being paid *-2 *t*-3.	probably	###right.###speakera9.###when i was in college *t*-1 i, i enjoyed teaching,###'cause i did some teaching part-time###and i really enjoyed that###but i wouldn't want *-1 to go *-2 teach high school or junior high,###it just, you know,###all the problems.###speakerb10.###oh, lord, i mean, yeah,###an, you talk about stress and pressure,###i tell you what,###it's, uh,###speakera11.###yeah,###they're putting in fifty, sixty hours a week, i'm sure 0 *t*-2, because they've got *-1 to grade papers and get class stuff ready.###speakerb12.###do,###right.###speakera13.
37841:20	but, uh, i can definitely, uh, see 0 on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age *t*-1, that's going *-2 to be a definite concern.	definitely	###right,###right.###well and, uh, you know, one thing 0 my wife and i've talked about *t*-1, i-, are, uh, private schools.###you know whether, uh, uh, we would want *-2 to invest in, in private schools as they're g-, growing up, because, you know, just in the dallas area, um, we're not real comfortable with the, with the public schools.###speakera37.###yeah.###speakerb38.###speakera39.###and dallas, uh, school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling.###speakerb40.###right.###speakera41.###i couldn't believe that.###speakerb42.###right.###you know, one, that's one reason 0 we bought a house here in plano *t*-1.###we were hoping, you know, well 0 the school district's going *-1 to be good, you know, for resale value, and, so on and so forth,###speakera43.###yeah.###speakerb44.
37865:118	and, you know, that's going * to, that's going *-4 to affect the people that *t*-1 are having kids in school, of course, which *t*-2 is probably the only fair thing 0 * to do *t*-3.	probably	###i think 0 there's only going *-1 to be one solution to school funding which i don't think 0 *t*-2 will be necessarily the best way###but i think 0 what *t*-1's going *-2 to have *-3 to happen is 0 there's going *-4 to have *-5 to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids.###that's the only way 0 they're going *-1 to fund it *t*-2, because if they start *-3 raising taxes for property, and people are going *-4 to throw a fit.###speakerb46.###that's,###yeah,###and, you know, that's,###taxes right now are political suicide.###speakera47.###oh, yeah.###speakerb48.###you know, and i don't think 0 any politician's going *-1 to do that,###so.###speakera49.###yeah,###and the only thing, 0 they, they would think of *t*-1 would be tuition, you know,###if it works at colleges it will work down below.###speakerb50.###right.###speakera51.
37869:124	and, you know, it's going *-1 to really hurt the, the middle class, uh, people, i think 0 *t*-4. because, uh, they're the ones that *t*-2 will probably have *-3 to, to carry the brunt of the load.	probably	###that's,###yeah,###and, you know, that's,###taxes right now are political suicide.###speakera47.###oh, yeah.###speakerb48.###you know, and i don't think 0 any politician's going *-1 to do that,###so.###speakera49.###yeah,###and the only thing, 0 they, they would think of *t*-1 would be tuition, you know,###if it works at colleges it will work down below.###speakerb50.###right.###speakera51.###and, you know, that's going * to, that's going *-4 to affect the people that *t*-1 are having kids in school, of course, which *t*-2 is probably the only fair thing 0 * to do *t*-3.###but, it will be hard for those that people, that *t*-1 have, have in school because they have *-2 to pay out even more.###speakerb52.###exactly.
37956:17	i, maybe i'm wrong, because i haven't, you know, been in that kind of environment for a long time,	maybe	###speakerb76.###yeah,###and.###speakera77.### you got * to, you got *-1 to be your child's best friend, i guess 0 *t*-3, even when they're a teenager and they, you know are kind of standoffish *t*-2,###speakerb78.###right.###speakera79.###still you got *-1 to be their best friend because when they've got problems *t*-2, who they going *-3 to go to *t*-4,###their friends that *t*-5 are dealing drugs, or, or your parents.###speakerb80.###exactly.###speakera81.###you know, an, and if they go to their friends dealing drugs, they're going *-1 to be in even worse shape.###speakerb82.###that's right.###speakera83.### and, and the schools don't, don't really encourage * to stay away from that, you know,###the schools are there *-1 to teach history and that we fought the civil war, etcetera, etcetera.###they don't teach them good values like drugs are bad.
38155:31	so. everything's changed so much 0 i probably couldn't even get a job right now.	probably	###is he a programmer?###speakerb50.###uh-huh.###speakera51.###i see.###speakerb52.###software design engineer, so, as they call it,###so.###but i have a degree in information management, which *t*-1 is computer, you know,###speakera53.###uh-huh.###speakerb54.###speakera55.###right.###speakerb56.###it's basically the, more *ich*-1 the bus-, business end of it than the programming end of it, you know.###speakera57.###right.###speakerb58.### so, but i've been at it for, you know, five years,
38311:8	you probably use mumblex or something like that, for your, uh, data entry stuff that you're, talking about *t*-1.	probably	###speakerb100.###um, all 0 i,###the packages i, i don't really use *t*-1,### i mumblex what i use *t*-1 that mumblex outside development that we use *t*-2###most of it's just stuff that *t*-3's been written *-4 in house that i use *t*-5.###speakera101.###oh, okay.###yeah.###golly,###i've got,### up, up at work anyway, i use wordperfect and lotus and, and mumblex which *t*-1 is, uh, uh, a, a line-draw package.###speakerb102.###yeah,###i know those two.###speakera103.###speakerb104.###uh-huh,###i've just used wordperfect and lotus and, the most.###speakera105.###yeah.
38412:11	i've maybe been into the office once in the past three years, you know.	maybe	###speakerb138.###yeah,###i bet.###yeah,###my hu-, he took one home when they, when they had it, you know, they had a big deadline coming up *t*-1###and it was looking a little touchy 0 * to meet *t*-1,###so.###speakera139.###uh-huh,###well, i've, i've done that before on, a couple times.###speakerb140.###yeah.###speakera141.###but that would make it just that much easier###instead of * bringing home a computer, you just bring home a few floppy disks, you know.###speakerb142.###uh-huh,###that's right.###i thought 0 that would be, you know,###because it's real nice with this because i don't even have *-1 to go into the office
38481:22	i read quite a bit, probably don't read as much as i would like *-1 to *?*.	probably	###bye, bye.###speakera157.###bye.###speakera1.###okay.###speakerb2.###okay,###that made a nice ugly sound.###so,###speakera3.###your name is lynn?###speakerb4.###linda.###speakera5.###linda.###speakerb6.###uh-huh.###so, * sounds like you like *-1 to read.###speakera7.###yeah,
38506:24	uh, the road less travelled was probably one of my favorites.	probably	###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###what do you like *-1 to read *t*-2?###speakera11.###um, well um, i'm a, i'm a counselor, a therapist by trade,###so most of my books are, um, i guess what you'd call *t*-1 self improvement type of books.###speakerb12.###that what i've been reading *t*-1 lately a lot of.###um, my interests switch around dramatically.###i used *-1 to read just, mainly fic-, fiction,###and now i, lik-, like a said, i've read a lot of self, self help books.###speakera13.###uh-huh.###what kind of things have you read *t*-1?###speakerb14.###oh, i read all kinds of things for, um, * helping people survive a divorce.###speakera15.###uh-huh.###speakerb16.
38527:13	well, um probably the best one that i, i know of *t*-1 and i work with *t*-1 all the time is called *-2 search for significance by robert mcgee	probably	###have you read that?###speakera17.###uh, i haven't gotten through it yet.###speakerb18.###you haven't *?*?###speakera19.###no.###speakerb20.###okay,###what would you recommend *t*-1?###speakera21.###um, as far as * dealing with divorce?###speakerb22.###oh, i'm kind of getting that one past me,###but a good self help book.###speakera23.###good self help.###speakerb24.###yeah.###speakera25.
38535:11	it's probably one 0 you'd find *t*-1 in like a christian book store.	probably	###okay,###what would you recommend *t*-1?###speakera21.###um, as far as * dealing with divorce?###speakerb22.###oh, i'm kind of getting that one past me,###but a good self help book.###speakera23.###good self help.###speakerb24.###yeah.###speakera25.###well, um probably the best one that i, i know of *t*-1 and i work with *t*-1 all the time is called *-2 search for significance by robert mcgee###speakerb26.###um, that sounds good.###speakera27.###speakerb28.###uh-huh.###speakera29.###and it's one that we use *t*-1 in our work.
38545:10	um, probably * should stay on the topic,	probably	###yeah.###speakera25.###well, um probably the best one that i, i know of *t*-1 and i work with *t*-1 all the time is called *-2 search for significance by robert mcgee###speakerb26.###um, that sounds good.###speakera27.###speakerb28.###uh-huh.###speakera29.###and it's one that we use *t*-1 in our work.###it's probably one 0 you'd find *t*-1 in like a christian book store.###i don't know what the chains are *t*-1 down there.###maybe in the mall family book store, something like that.###speakerb30.###uh-huh.###i'm writing it down.###that does soun-, that's sound really good.###um, what kind of counseling do you do *t*-1,###or should we stay on the topic of books?###speakera31.
38823:24	i'd say 0 reading is probably one of my biggest ones, because it's the type of thing that you can, you can do *t*-1 a little bit at a time, whereas,	probably	###speakera1.###okay,###what kind of hobbies do you have *t*-1?###speakerb2.###um, mostly what i do *t*-1,###i do do some crafts like it mentioned in the thing,###and then i, i read a lot.###speakera3.###uh-huh.###i like *-1 to read, too.###i was trying *-1 to think of some while, while it was, uh, talking about it,###and then i,###it *exp*-1 took so long for someone to answer,###i started *-1 reading the newspaper, and kind of forgot about it.###speakerb4.###oh.###speakera5.###speakerb6.###speakera7.###but, uh, yeah,
38936:23	and it was about fifteen by twenty maybe.	maybe	###speakerb40.###right.###speakera41.###no,###you must pay all attention to what you're doing *t*-1.### it's, it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be *?*.###it took me, uh, quite a bit of time.###i though, oh, this won't take long at all.###but i was wrong.###speakerb42.###uh-huh.###speakera43.### it took, it took a while 0 * to do *t*-1.###but, it was fun,###i enjoyed it.###speakerb44.###yeah.###the first project 0 i started out *t*-1 one was a big one,### it was, uh, it was of a lady###and she was kneeling,
39022:23	but i think 0 we're probably past that now.	probably	###speakerb66.###yeah.###speakera67.###but, uh,###speakerb68.###well we,###speakera69.### i like *-1 to, i like *-2 to do, uh, stuff with plants.### i like, um, i have a lot of plants in my apartment,###and i've got a pretty small porch,###but it's, it's, uh,###i've got a few planters out there that i, i'll, uh, you know,###in the winter time i usually plant some pansies in there,###and then in the summer i'll plant petunias, or something that *t*-1's colorful###and like, that blooms a lot.###but * haven't done that yet.###speakerb70.###uh-huh.###speakera71.###i kept *-2 thinking that it was going *-1 to get cold one more time,
39023:8	i probably should go *-1 buy some.	probably	###yeah.###speakera67.###but, uh,###speakerb68.###well we,###speakera69.### i like *-1 to, i like *-2 to do, uh, stuff with plants.### i like, um, i have a lot of plants in my apartment,###and i've got a pretty small porch,###but it's, it's, uh,###i've got a few planters out there that i, i'll, uh, you know,###in the winter time i usually plant some pansies in there,###and then in the summer i'll plant petunias, or something that *t*-1's colorful###and like, that blooms a lot.###but * haven't done that yet.###speakerb70.###uh-huh.###speakera71.###i kept *-2 thinking that it was going *-1 to get cold one more time,###but i think 0 we're probably past that now.
39027:33	i guess 0 if i had a house i might enjoy gardening, some.	might	###well we,###speakera69.### i like *-1 to, i like *-2 to do, uh, stuff with plants.### i like, um, i have a lot of plants in my apartment,###and i've got a pretty small porch,###but it's, it's, uh,###i've got a few planters out there that i, i'll, uh, you know,###in the winter time i usually plant some pansies in there,###and then in the summer i'll plant petunias, or something that *t*-1's colorful###and like, that blooms a lot.###but * haven't done that yet.###speakerb70.###uh-huh.###speakera71.###i kept *-2 thinking that it was going *-1 to get cold one more time,###but i think 0 we're probably past that now.###i probably should go *-1 buy some.###speakerb72.###yeah.###speakera73.
39066:16	and so that's probably my problem there.	probably	###i feel real good if i water them###and they continue *-1 to grow.###you know, i feel like, oh, i've accomplished something.###speakera79.###uh-huh.###speakerb80.###so i enjoy it,###but i'm just not experienced enough with it.###uh-huh.###speakera81.###yeah.###i don't know too much about it either.###mine's pretty limited to my little, uh, porch plants.###speakerb82.###speakera83.###and then the ones in my apartment, half of which *t*-1 don't look real healthy,###but i don't always get direct sun except in certain spots.###speakerb84.###oh, yeah.###speakera85.
39084:58	and i'd, i think 0 when i was real little *t*-1 i probably had a finger in on that every time 0 he did it *t*-2 and had *-3 to be out there and watch and that type of stuff.	probably	###oh, yeah.###speakera85.###and so that's probably my problem there.###but,###speakerb86.###have you tried any, *-1 growing any, um, like fruits and vegetables or anything?###i guess 0 vegetables are in, insi-, like in pots and stuff?###speakera87.###no,###i never have tried that, just because i don't have that much space on this little porch *ich*-1 here in this apartment or this little balcony.###speakerb88.###uh-huh.###speakera89.###and my other two pots are,### they're kind of, they're pretty big,###and i have enough plants in them that it takes up a lot of my porch area,###so between that and the chairs and the barbecue grill and the fireplace wood, there's no room for much else.###speakerb90.###speakera91.###but my dad, uh, my dad used *-1 to grow tomatoes and things at the house.
39150:19	and we thought, well maybe when they're a little bit bigger *t*-1 then we'll,	maybe	###speakera109.###and sure enough, boy the fur just came off like crazy once i got them in the tub.###speakerb110.###oh, yeah.###speakera111.###so, they're pretty content now,###but they were mad at me for quite a while.###they went and hid after they, after they got dried *-1 off.###speakerb112.###* sulked for a while,###huh.###speakera113.###yeah.###speakerb114.###well, i like animals,###but we don't have any yet.###we have a nine month old with another on the way###speakera115.###uh-huh.###speakerb116.
39179:40	if we were going *-1 to get anything now it would definitely be a cat, or even a bird or a fish tank or something, you know. something small	definitely	###but i like dogs###and my husband likes cats.###so we haven't reached a real agreement on that yet.###if we get a place where we can have both *t*-1, it'll be great,###but until then,###speakera121.###yeah,###i like both,###but since i'm in an apartment, i just, i don't think 0 an apartment is big enough for a dog.### dogs, to me, dogs *ich*-1 need a yard, even little dogs.###speakerb122.###uh-huh.###speakera123.###they just need a yard.###cats can deal with *-1 being inside all the time just fine.###but i just think 0 dogs need, need *-1 to be outside, though.###so,###speakerb124.###i agree with you.###i,
39190:65	because, you kind of, even, even a cat, you never know when they might bite or scratch or something *t*-1.	might	###uh-huh.###speakera123.###they just need a yard.###cats can deal with *-1 being inside all the time just fine.###but i just think 0 dogs need, need *-1 to be outside, though.###so,###speakerb124.###i agree with you.###i,###if we were going *-1 to get anything now it would definitely be a cat, or even a bird or a fish tank or something, you know. something small###speakera125.###yeah,###now that's an idea###speakerb126.###speakera127.###with the small babies.###speakerb128.###that she can watch *t*-1, but *t*-1 won't take too much care.###speakera129.###yeah,
39194:17	they're not as likely *-2 to *?* as a dog might *?*, i guess 0 *t*-1.	likely	###but i just think 0 dogs need, need *-1 to be outside, though.###so,###speakerb124.###i agree with you.###i,###if we were going *-1 to get anything now it would definitely be a cat, or even a bird or a fish tank or something, you know. something small###speakera125.###yeah,###now that's an idea###speakerb126.###speakera127.###with the small babies.###speakerb128.###that she can watch *t*-1, but *t*-1 won't take too much care.###speakera129.###yeah,###because, you kind of, even, even a cat, you never know when they might bite or scratch or something *t*-1.###speakerb130.###uh-huh.###speakera131.

39558:8	we might try *-1 to, to, um, to grill some flounder or salmon steaks.	might	###just plain yogurt.###it gives it a little tang.###speakerb136.###i'll bet 0 that is really good.###speakera137.###it makes a great sandwich.###speakerb138.###man,###i'm going *-1 to have *-2 to think of that.###we're getting company tonight,###speakera139.###oh, are you *?*.###speakerb140.###and i have been debating what *-2 to cook *t*-1 because one of my guests is a vegetarian.###speakera141.###oh, yeah,###that's kind of hard.###speakerb142.###so, we're going *-1 to,###i think 0 we'll try *-1 to do something a little bit,
39571:15	and, um, definitely go with, it will have *-1 to be a rice dish lots of vegetables, * to make up for the lack of meat.	definitely	###and i have been debating what *-2 to cook *t*-1 because one of my guests is a vegetarian.###speakera141.###oh, yeah,###that's kind of hard.###speakerb142.###so, we're going *-1 to,###i think 0 we'll try *-1 to do something a little bit,###we might try *-1 to, to, um, to grill some flounder or salmon steaks.###speakera143.###they'll eat fish?###speakerb144.###yeah.###speakera145.###she'll eat fish.###speakerb146.###and, i usually,###when they come down *t*-1 i'll grill those and brush on a little lemon butter sauce###speakera147.###uh-huh.###speakerb148.
39636:11	i'll might have *-1 to visit the state book store.	might	###it isn't *?*.###speakerb168.###where did you get,###speakera169.###and you can put some cucumber slices on too.###speakerb170.###where did you get this cook book *t*-1?###speakera171.###i got it at the checkbook store.###speakerb172.###really!###speakera173.###and, it's got beaut-, all these beautiful pictures, in there that *t*-1 are inspiring.###speakerb174.###speakera175.###it's going *-1 to say, uh, edited * by charlotte turgeon, editor of, i'm not french, laroute, gastro lamink###speakerb176.###speakera177.###the creative cooking course.###speakerb178.
39894:21	and, and maybe they were *?*,	maybe	###but, uh,###speakerb38.###so, did you watch the, uh, final four this year?###speakera39.###oh, yeah.### i watched every, uh, i watched all three games of that.###speakerb40.###every game?###speakera41.###and, uh, i was very pleased with all three games, because kansas, uh, you know,###i was pulling for kansas on the other side,###so it *exp*-2 was real nice * to have the, the teams that *t*-1 were there.###speakerb42.###right,###right.###speakera43.###of course, i wasn't really,###i mean, i, i,###u n l v kind of gave me the impression of * being a, uh, uh, oh, i don't know, a macho team, you know,### they just didn't seem, they seemed *-1 to think 0 they were better than everybody else
39962:52	i think, i think 0 that, that probably was the difference in that game.	probably	###but they weren't ahead as much as they normally are *?*.###speakerb60.###right.###speakera61.###uh, and, you know, that meant that they had *-1 to play a second half###and they, they've not had *-1 to do that all year###and, uh,###speakerb62.###right,###right.### they didn't have, they didn't have *-1 to go through some tough games during the year### and that, and that, so that's a terrible time 0 * to have *-1 to deal with that *t*-2, right in, when it, when it counts so much *t*-3.###speakera63.###that's right.###i mean duke's schedule was, was so much harder than u n l v's that it, uh, it just made them a much tougher team overall,###speakerb64.###right.###speakera65.###and, uh, that had *-1 to help them a lot.###speakerb66.
40027:20	one of those two will probably be, um, in there,	probably	###i think 0 magic does a,###speakerb86.###they'll make it, you know,### i-, i-, it, it's going *-1 to be a war between, uh, between chicago and, uh, and, uh, uh, boston celtics.###speakera87.###oh, yeah.###speakerb88.###that's going *-1 to be a war.###speakera89.###that sure is *?*.###it,###speakerb90.###it's going *-1 to be a great series.###speakera91.###i think 0 that's going *-1 to be one of those that *t*-4's, uh, that *t*-2's won *-3 by the home team, you know,###speakerb92.###yeah.###speakera93.###whoever *t*-1 has home court advantage is going *-2 to win that one i think 0 *t*-3.###speakerb94.
40043:17	so, uh, that might help them.	might	###yeah.###speakera93.###whoever *t*-1 has home court advantage is going *-2 to win that one i think 0 *t*-3.###speakerb94.###one of those two will probably be, um, in there,###um, * let me see,###where does detroit fit in *t*-1?###speakera95.###detroit's in that same, uh, that, that same, uh, division.###speakerb96.###uh-huh.###so, i don't know,###those three,###uh, detroit hasn't been having that great a year this year.###speakera97.###no,###but as i heard, isaiah came back this week.###speakerb98.###uh-huh.###speakera99.
40145:13	well, that might have been what it was *t*-1,	might	### he's, uh, he's,###too bad the mavericks couldn't get him.###speakera139.###that's true.###speakerb140.###with roy tarpley they're in big trouble.###speakera141.###yeah.###well then, he's gone now###so, they don't have *-1 to worry about that.###speakerb142.###yeah,###for awhile anyway.###speakera143.###well, i thought 0 he was gone period.### i, i didn't read the story,###but i, i, read that, uh,###speakerb144.###i heard 0 he was suspended *-1. because of his,###speakera145.
40149:17	i, maybe i misunderstood what they meant *t*-1.	maybe	###speakerb140.###with roy tarpley they're in big trouble.###speakera141.###yeah.###well then, he's gone now###so, they don't have *-1 to worry about that.###speakerb142.###yeah,###for awhile anyway.###speakera143.###well, i thought 0 he was gone period.### i, i didn't read the story,###but i, i, read that, uh,###speakerb144.###i heard 0 he was suspended *-1. because of his,###speakera145.###well, that might have been what it was *t*-1,###speakerb146.###speakera147.###but i, i guess 0 the headlines said something about him, you know, that the mavericks released him or something,
40308:48	i'm kind of had different, different ideas from what probably the majority of people have *t*-1,	probably	###uh, do you work?###speakerb14.###yeah,###i do.###speakera15.###okay.###speakerb16.###i do,###i work### and, and, uh, brian's in a day care center.### he's uh, he was two in december,###speakera17.###oh.###speakerb18.###so he's not quite two and a half yet.###speakera19.###uh-huh.###speakerb20.###he,###uh, i put him,
40493:126	and, uh, when school lets out *t*-1, i just don't, i haven't, i have no idea what i'm going *-2 to do *t*-3, because i certainly can't afford what we did *t*-4 last year which *t*-5 was,	certainly	###yeah.###yeah,###so, i felt real good about that,###but, uh, boy, i tell you 0 with summer coming up i'm just pulling my hair out, in terms of what i'm going *-1 to do *t*-2,### i, i guess 0 i, went back to work about a year and a half ago###speakerb86.###speakera87.###and, uh, i worked full time all last year###and now i'm going to school *ich*-1 part time and, uh, graduate school,###and i'm working part time.###and, so i'm still,###speakerb88.###i know how that goes *t*-1.###speakera89.###yeah.###i'm still going full time,###but i only have half time salary,###speakerb90.###yeah.###speakera91.
41103:8	everybody might not like that.	might	###uh-huh.###speakera65.###speakerb66.###oh.###speakera67.###but you had a choice###and then you got *-1 to taste a lot of new dishes and stuff too, and get a lot of good recipes.###speakerb68.###yeah.###speakera69.###speakerb70.###yeah.###speakera71.###where if you said a certain thing and say, okay, we're all going *-1 to have fried fish, or, we're all going, *-2 to have fried chicken.###speakerb72.###yeah.###speakera73.###speakerb74.###yeah.###speakera75.
41220:63	and then, every time 0 you wanted *-1 to go *-2 eat with somebody *t*-3, you'd probably have *-4 to go to out, *-5 eat or something.	probably	###speakerb114.###a house or something.###speakera115.###speakerb116.###uh-huh.###speakera117.###and, then it has little rooms off of it where, you know, you'd go and sleep at night time *t*-1.###speakerb118.###oh!###speakera119.###but, then it has like a kitchenette and things like that###but you,###speakerb120.###see, that would be great because then you could spend so much more time *ich*-1 together, than if you all were in your own hotels or something.###speakera121.###right.###speakerb122.###speakera123.###and another,###speakerb124.
41587:34	so. it, it, uh, definitely fluctuates mainly with what i'm going *-1 to be doing *t*-2 that day and kind of what my mood is *t*-3	definitely	###i know 0 many people are co-, very comfortable in the classroom and what have *t*-1 you *-2 wearing pants.###speakerb11.###speakera12.###uh, it,###i guess 0 i was just old enough *-1 not to, uh, be very comfortable in it.###speakerb13.###uh-huh.###speakera14.###how about you?###speakerb15.###well, i work at t i###and they don't really have, uh, dress code, so * to speak there.###it's pretty lax about, um, you know,### we-, you can pretty much wear whatever you want *-1 to *?* *t*-2,###and i wear anything from jeans, when i'm feeling really casual *t*-1 to, uh, suits and dresses when i'm meeting with a customer *t*-2###or, i, i teach training classes,###and so when i'm teaching a class *t*-1, obviously i wear a suit or dress,###speakera16.###oh.###speakerb17.
41591:34	and when it's raining *t*-1, i'm more likely *-2 to wear jeans	likely	###i guess 0 i was just old enough *-1 not to, uh, be very comfortable in it.###speakerb13.###uh-huh.###speakera14.###how about you?###speakerb15.###well, i work at t i###and they don't really have, uh, dress code, so * to speak there.###it's pretty lax about, um, you know,### we-, you can pretty much wear whatever you want *-1 to *?* *t*-2,###and i wear anything from jeans, when i'm feeling really casual *t*-1 to, uh, suits and dresses when i'm meeting with a customer *t*-2###or, i, i teach training classes,###and so when i'm teaching a class *t*-1, obviously i wear a suit or dress,###speakera16.###oh.###speakerb17.###so. it, it, uh, definitely fluctuates mainly with what i'm going *-1 to be doing *t*-2 that day and kind of what my mood is *t*-3###speakera18.###uh-huh.###speakerb19.
41594:48	and, and when it's really cold *t*-1 i'm more likely *-2 to wear jeans or pants or sweaters, or that type of thing.	likely	###speakera14.###how about you?###speakerb15.###well, i work at t i###and they don't really have, uh, dress code, so * to speak there.###it's pretty lax about, um, you know,### we-, you can pretty much wear whatever you want *-1 to *?* *t*-2,###and i wear anything from jeans, when i'm feeling really casual *t*-1 to, uh, suits and dresses when i'm meeting with a customer *t*-2###or, i, i teach training classes,###and so when i'm teaching a class *t*-1, obviously i wear a suit or dress,###speakera16.###oh.###speakerb17.###so. it, it, uh, definitely fluctuates mainly with what i'm going *-1 to be doing *t*-2 that day and kind of what my mood is *t*-3###speakera18.###uh-huh.###speakerb19.###and when it's raining *t*-1, i'm more likely *-2 to wear jeans###speakera20.###speakerb21.
41621:26	just because it's, maybe it's just because of the sexist views and everything	maybe	###yes.###speakerb25.###speakera26.###and i think 0 that does make a difference,###because when you do have *-1 to be in front of people *t*-2, uh, i think 0 *t*-3 you, the, the tendency there is * to wear dresses and suits and, and, uh, more classical style of clothing.###speakerb27.###uh-huh.###speakera28.###speakerb29.###uh-huh.###speakera30.###what about the mini skirt?###speakerb31.###there are a few people *ich*-2 every now and then that *t*-1 wear those to work.###they're pretty strict about that, though.###um, i've never worn,###i just wouldn't,###i mean even * to,###well jeans aren't exactly professional###but, for some reason a mini skirt is, to me a little more unprofessional 0 * to wear *t*-1 to work than jeans
41674:8	because maybe they, those are not the clothes that *t*-1 are the most, uh, appealing to you, or the most, uh, complimentary to you.	maybe	###uh-huh.###speakera44.###now, i also, uh,###even though i retired from education, i, uh, i do modeling###and i teach at a modeling agency here.###speakerb45.###uh-huh.###speakera46.### and, uh, so, when we are doing wardrobing *t*-1 and we have, uh, two, two hour classes in wardrobe, we do discuss a great deal, the mini skirt and the types of clothes 0 * to wear *t*-2 on the job.###speakerb47.###uh-huh.###speakera48.###uh, even though i may have them from sixth grade on up through, uh, grandmothers, in my class.###speakerb49.###uh-huh.###speakera50.###and, uh, whe-, i always try *-1 to emphasize 0 the, clothes that you wear *t*-2 should not necessarily be the greatest fad,###speakerb51.###uh-huh.###speakera52.
41698:8	again maybe because i was at the school, there were still many teachers who *t*-2 wore mini skirts,	maybe	###but, uh, the mini skirt many times will evoke comments 0 you don't really want *t*-1.###speakerb55.###right.###speakera56.### and, and then, uh, then you're in the situation where you're very unhappy *t*-1.###speakerb57.###uh-huh.###well i feel like too, on the job, when, you know, there's men around and some of the managers are men *t*-1, you just, you know, you don't want them looking at your legs necessarily.###speakera58.###that's right.###speakerb59.###and, uh, to me i just wouldn't feel comfortable in that at work,###but, uh,###speakera60.###well, i, i, uh, i have *-1 to, uh, agree with that,###even when they was very, very popular *t*-2 in the early sixties,###speakerb61.###uh-huh.###speakera62.###uh, i, uh, uh,
41802:64	and they don't allow, uh, any sweat, any sweat shirts or t shirts that *t*-1 might have vulgar, or, you know, anything like that on it,	might	###that's what i, one thing 0 i like *t*-2 about t i is that they aren't overly strict about what you wear *t*-3###and they don't, you know, your boss doesn't come up to you and say now * remember, tomorrow you have a meeting###so you'd better wear a suit.###speakera98.###speakerb99.###i mean, they, they leave it up to you and your judgment * to, to use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have *t*-1.###speakera100.###right.###speakerb101.###speakera102.###yes.###speakerb103.###the only real restrictions 0 they have *t*-1 are, uh, no halter tops and no shorts,###even the long walking short of the squirts, the, the split skirts, anything that, that *t*-2 could be considered *-3 shorts they don't allow *t*-4.###speakera104.###yes.###speakerb105.###speakera106.###that's good.###speakerb107.
41815:87	whereas, uh, sometimes when you're in the suit and feel, kind of almost stiff and you're not, you know, maybe you don't, uh, can't get as comfortable *-2 to sit down *t*-1	maybe	###even the long walking short of the squirts, the, the split skirts, anything that, that *t*-2 could be considered *-3 shorts they don't allow *t*-4.###speakera104.###yes.###speakerb105.###speakera106.###that's good.###speakerb107.###and they don't allow, uh, any sweat, any sweat shirts or t shirts that *t*-1 might have vulgar, or, you know, anything like that on it,###but, other than that, it's pretty, pretty lax###speakera108.###yeah,###uh-huh.###speakerb109.###and i think 0 that's good because it does allow people to be individual###and it allows you to kind of dress the way 0 you feel *t*-1 that day.###speakera110.###yes.###speakerb111.###or, you know, if you want *-1 to be comfortable and casual you can *?*,###and sometimes i think 0 you may be more productive if you're comfortable with what you're wearing *t*-1 and can be, be, feel more relaxed.
41863:24	i guess 0 we've talked probably long enough.	probably	###and one was a skirt###and one was a pant.###speakerb121.###uh, right.###speakera122.###speakerb123.###yeah.###speakera124.### and, uh, and i think 0 that's sad because that doesn't allow for any individuality.###speakerb125.###uh-huh.###speakera126.###that's, uh, can stifle creativity.###speakerb127.###right,###i agree.###speakera128.###so.###speakerb129.###well, it,
42156:13	and that's maybe what you were talking about *t*-1.	maybe	###oh, really.###speakera93.### my daughter, my daughter lives down in rowlett###speakerb94.###yeah.###speakera95.###and she was telling me about it.###speakerb96.###oh really.###speakera97.###yeah.###speakerb98.###yeah.###speakera99.###uh, i can't remember what the town was *t*-1, some little area.###speakerb100.###we've had several here lately###and, it,###there were several of them in north dallas###and then it started kind of *-1 happening a couple of places in south dallas
42178:87	i think 0 there's been, i think 0 there's been like six or seven of them, over the last like probably eight or nine months.	probably	###speakera101.###oh gosh.###speakerb102.###speakera103.###and that's the last 0 they se-,###speakerb104.###speakera105.###yeah.###speakerb106.###speakera107.###oh, gee.###speakerb108.###speakera109.###is that right.###speakerb110.###yes,###that is happened,###speakera111.###i hadn't heard about that.###speakerb112.
42219:10	god, maybe i'll take it out.	maybe	###speakerb122.###oh, can you imagine, because it, it happens in the middle of the night,###so the parent, you know, these parents didn't know 0 this, the, the kid was gone until the kid is knocking on the door *-1 screaming, * let me in.###speakera123.###yeah.###speakerb124.###speakera125.###oh, boy.###speakerb126.###you know, can you imagine.###speakera127.###yeah,###you wouldn't even dare *-1 put these signs in the win-, little emblems *ich*-2 in the window saying child in this room, in case of fire, you know.###have you seen those?###speakerb128.###shoo-, i, you know, i've got one of those in brian's room.###speakera129.###yeah.###speakerb130.###i never even thought about that.
42454:11	it would probably be somewhere closer to, uh, less control because i don't see,	probably	###speakerb210.###it's just 0 the system has just,### an-, and i understand 0 they're doing it because the prisons are full,###but somewhere we've got *-1 to come up with some money * to build, *-2 to build more, you know, and keep these people in them, you know.###speakera211.###right,###i think so.###speakerb212.###speakera213.###yeah,###i think 0 it would be worth it###everybody wo-,###speakerb214.###well, i was watching a show about this the other night###and, you know, they were like in a, i think 0 it was on forty-eight hours.###speakera1.###okay,###well what do you think *t*-1?###speakerb2.###well, i'm kind of leaning towards, i don't know, i'm thinking about what, from one to ten what my no would be *t*-1.
42525:21	but, but maybe we'll prevent a few john hinckleys.	maybe	###speakerb26.###you know, but,###speakera27.###yeah,###but he has *-1 to go out and do it.###that's true, i think 0 *t*-1,###speakerb28.###yeah,### if, and if it's a private sale, of course, then there's nothing.###speakera29.###right.###and, see that's my only problem with, uh, * making you, um, you know, get the check and everything is, is, 0 i guess 0 bad guys, if you want *-1 to call them bad guys, they are going *-2 to get a gun no matter what.###speakerb30.###uh-huh.###speakera31.###they're not,###i don't think 0 they're going *-1 to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there's a check *t*-2,###i think 0 they're going *-1 to go out and find it someway, individual sale or something like that.###speakerb32.###yes.
42736:85	because i started *-2 shooting, my dad started *-3 letting me shoot like a little air b b gun, when i was probably five or six years old *t*-1.	probably	###speakerb106.###i don't know.###i,###speakera107.###speakerb108.###that's kind of an odd thing.###i don't know,###i have a gun###and, uh, my folks have always had *?*.###i learned *-1 to shoot when i was real little *t*-2.###speakera109.###uh-huh.###speakerb110.###i think 0 that's a lot of it too, is that people need *-1 to teach their kids, what * not to, what * to do *t*-2 and what * not to do *t*-3.###speakera111.###right.###speakerb112.###speakera113.###exactly.###speakerb114.
43129:13	this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt, and some saint augustine.	probably	###as far as i can tell it hasn't killed anything 0 it wasn't supposed *-1 to *?* *t*-2.###even the area of the grass that *t*-1 was underneath and around the mounds it didn't kill it.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###speakera35.###really?###well, that's pretty wild.###yeah,###we used it for fleas.###we had fleas in our yard real bad last year,###and we did that um,### i just, i'm not,###basically, i like *-1 to mow the lawn, * believe it or not,###but i sometimes have problems *-1 starting the mower,###so a lot of times i won't get out and do it,###but my husband, basically, does most of it,###and he does the, you know, edging and all that kind of thing,###and we're renting,###and so we don't really put a lot of money into the, uh, you know, like
43134:30	and we're just not real into the lawn probably because we're renting, i guess 0 *t*-1, huh?	probably	###speakera35.###really?###well, that's pretty wild.###yeah,###we used it for fleas.###we had fleas in our yard real bad last year,###and we did that um,### i just, i'm not,###basically, i like *-1 to mow the lawn, * believe it or not,###but i sometimes have problems *-1 starting the mower,###so a lot of times i won't get out and do it,###but my husband, basically, does most of it,###and he does the, you know, edging and all that kind of thing,###and we're renting,###and so we don't really put a lot of money into the, uh, you know, like###this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt, and some saint augustine.### we just, we have winter rye out back,###and we have,###i don't even know what it is *t*-1 out front,###but, um, we, this is the first house 0 we've ever lived in *t*-1,
43364:21	i thought gosh i'd probably have nightmares for the next six months.	probably	###yeah.###speakerb15.###it's like,###i mean it just blew me away.###speakera16.###yeah,### i'd, i bet.###speakerb17.###speakera18.###yeah.###there're several of them that *t*-1 are out right now that i want *-2 to see *t*-3.###uh, dances. uh, silence of the lambs.###speakerb19.###yeah.###speakera20.###speakerb21.###uh, i'm, i'm afraid *-1 to go *-2 see that one.###that one looks so scary just, from the previews.###speakera22.###speakerb23.
43504:11	i should probably go back and read the book now that i just saw the movie again not too long ago.	probably	###no,###nobody could figure it out.###i mean the, the book was so much, uh,###speakerb67.###yeah.###speakera68.###there's just things,###all 0 you can do *t*-1 is * put it in words.###you can't put it in pictures.###speakerb69.###yeah.###yeah.###speakera70.###you know, a lot of that stuff that *t*-1 was going on in the film, you co-, say what is this *t*-2?###speakerb71.###speakera72.###you know, what's the significance of the apes *t*-1, you know.###speakerb73.###yeah,###yeah.
43690:65	if i ever get the hankering *-1 to see something, i've got, i don't know, maybe about thirty or forty movies	maybe	###speakerb135.###yeah.###yeah.###i've never seen any of those.###speakera136.###i can't stand stallone.###speakerb137.###yeah.###i can't *?* either.###he seems so macho 0 i just.###speakera138.###yeah.###and i, i was afraid that rambo was going *-1 to do the same thing that rocky was going *-2 to do *t*-3, you know. go into fourteen hundred episodes.###speakerb139.###yeah.###speakera140.###speakerb141.###yeah.###speakera142.###now i don't, i hardly ever watch t v.
43819:30	cause when you're touristing *t*-1, you probably don't want *-2 to take the time *-3 to go *-4 see a movie.	probably	###yeah,###yeah.###speakera186.###okay,###big deal.###here's *t*-1 some rocks sitting out in the middle of a field.###okay.###it's boring.###speakerb187.###did you see any movies over there?###speakera188.###speakerb189.###i remember 0 i went *-1 to see don quixote over there when it came out *t*-2.###it came out right around the time, with sophia loren###and that was a riot * to see that.###speakera190.###you know something,### i, * come *-1 to think of it, i don't think 0 i went to the movies one time.###speakerb191.###yeah.

44024:12	which *t*-1 might be a bigger problem than it would be, uh,	might	###so they put up, uh, a quarter inch masonite, basically,###and they painted it kind of like a spun of a sorts###so it's real cheap.###and, uh, uh, i've had thirteen hundred dollar bid and i, as low as five hundred and forty dollars###so it's, just a matter of,###speakerb30.###wow. that's quite a range.###speakera31.###it's,###speakerb32.###speakera33.###oh, there one guy 0 *t*-1 brags about his piece of equipment 0 he's using *t*-2 and the drop cloths and all that kind crap###and i'm so much *ich*-1 worried about that as what,###i don't want it all over the brick and windows###speakerb34.###yeah.###speakera35.###and,###speakerb36.###yeah,
44365:15	the poverty level is certainly, uh, you know, much worse in the latin american countries.	certainly	###speakerb100.###speakera101.###they tend *-1 to be more,###like not stand up for their rights as much.###they're not really sure of what they are *t*-1. i don't think 0 *t*-2.###speakerb102.###uh, i never really thought of, it that way.###speakera103.###well, i mean, how, can you contrast the europeans and their vocalism on their rights to, to say the people in latin america *t*-1.###speakerb104.###speakera105.###i mean, why are they, why are they not as vocal *t*-1###or why do they not, you know, stand up, * so to speak, for their rights *t*-1?###speakerb106.###i don't know,###* could be the, the economic still.###speakera107.###speakerb108.###you know, the,###there's,
44367:59	i think 0 it has something 0 *t*-1 to do with the poverty level because africa is certainly not a catholic, uh, country,	certainly	###they tend *-1 to be more,###like not stand up for their rights as much.###they're not really sure of what they are *t*-1. i don't think 0 *t*-2.###speakerb102.###uh, i never really thought of, it that way.###speakera103.###well, i mean, how, can you contrast the europeans and their vocalism on their rights to, to say the people in latin america *t*-1.###speakerb104.###speakera105.###i mean, why are they, why are they not as vocal *t*-1###or why do they not, you know, stand up, * so to speak, for their rights *t*-1?###speakerb106.###i don't know,###* could be the, the economic still.###speakera107.###speakerb108.###you know, the,###there's,###the poverty level is certainly, uh, you know, much worse in the latin american countries.###i mean, you can say that about africa too.
44397:19	or like you say, maybe communication of * knowing that, hey, up in other english colonies, or previous english colonies, everything is equal and yet down there it's not *?*,	maybe	###because i think that they are pretty vocal about it in, in, uh, africa.###i think 0 they've made a lot more chances.### they, they've, they're very vocal.###speakerb114.###well, in south africa,###yeah.###in south africa i think 0 they are *?* *t*-1,###but yet, you know,###speakera115.###so, what's the difference *t*-1?###speakerb116.###idi amin was, you know, in power for so long.###speakera117.###yeah.###speakerb118.###speakera119.###so what *t*-1 makes the difference between, say south america and the rest, i mean, south africa and it is rest of africa?###yeah.###speakerb120.###uh, racial, i think *t*-1,
44400:80	you know, i think 0 communication does have a lot 0 *t*-1 to do with it, you know, in education, maybe.	maybe	###speakerb114.###well, in south africa,###yeah.###in south africa i think 0 they are *?* *t*-1,###but yet, you know,###speakera115.###so, what's the difference *t*-1?###speakerb116.###idi amin was, you know, in power for so long.###speakera117.###yeah.###speakerb118.###speakera119.###so what *t*-1 makes the difference between, say south america and the rest, i mean, south africa and it is rest of africa?###yeah.###speakerb120.###uh, racial, i think *t*-1,###or like you say, maybe communication of * knowing that, hey, up in other english colonies, or previous english colonies, everything is equal and yet down there it's not *?*,###speakera121.###speakerb122.
44409:18	i think 0 it maybe has * to do with a lo-, a lot 0 *t*-1 to do with education	maybe	###speakera117.###yeah.###speakerb118.###speakera119.###so what *t*-1 makes the difference between, say south america and the rest, i mean, south africa and it is rest of africa?###yeah.###speakerb120.###uh, racial, i think *t*-1,###or like you say, maybe communication of * knowing that, hey, up in other english colonies, or previous english colonies, everything is equal and yet down there it's not *?*,###speakera121.###speakerb122.###you know, i think 0 communication does have a lot 0 *t*-1 to do with it, you know, in education, maybe.###speakera123.###yeah.###speakerb124.###i don't know about education###because the black community is still not very educated down there.###so, i think 0 it is communication,###it's just oopsy.###speakera125.
44502:8	it certainly is *?*.	certainly	###uh.###speakera155.###but, i, i,###speakera1.###hi, wanet.###how are you *t*-1?###speakerb2.###i'm doing fine.###where you from *t*-1?###speakera3.###i'm from new england.###massachusetts.###speakerb4.###okay.###i'm from berkeley, california.###speakera5.###wow!###this is quite a, quite a long distance.###speakerb6.###yeah,
44578:10	oh, possibly four.	possibly	###oh, yeah.###speakera29.###so, i've had this dog now for, for sixteen years###and she's been a lot of company.###uh, she's, uh, however, getting a little old###and things are starting *-1 to fail.###uh, i, i live *-1 alone now###and she stays in the house all day while i go to work###and, uh, she's been holding herself pretty well. the, uh, up until, you know, recently where she's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is *t*-1 *t*-2###and, uh, i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home *t*-1.###but she's, she's usually pretty good.###speakerb30.###yes,###well. my, my mother has one that *t*-1's, uh,### it's, uh, it's, uh, teacup###and, uh, it's made such a difference for her.###but, you know, just, i, e-, e-, you know,###the way 0 my mom's presence countenance is *t*-1, just, just for * having a puppy###but, you know, * having this dog###she's had it for, i guess three years now.
44589:30	and if that weren't so, i would certainly have one.	certainly	###speakerb30.###yes,###well. my, my mother has one that *t*-1's, uh,### it's, uh, it's, uh, teacup###and, uh, it's made such a difference for her.###but, you know, just, i, e-, e-, you know,###the way 0 my mom's presence countenance is *t*-1, just, just for * having a puppy###but, you know, * having this dog###she's had it for, i guess three years now.###oh, possibly four.###speakera31.###uh-huh.###speakerb32.###but, uh, it was, it, it's it's really made such a difference for her.###i really would like *-1 to, uh,###i'm a disabled person###speakera33.###uh-huh.###speakerb34.###so i'm unable *-1 to, to, really take care of a pet
44595:13	well, you might want *-1 to get yourself, uh, an animal that *t*-2 doesn't require much attention. like a cat.	might	###the way 0 my mom's presence countenance is *t*-1, just, just for * having a puppy###but, you know, * having this dog###she's had it for, i guess three years now.###oh, possibly four.###speakera31.###uh-huh.###speakerb32.###but, uh, it was, it, it's it's really made such a difference for her.###i really would like *-1 to, uh,###i'm a disabled person###speakera33.###uh-huh.###speakerb34.###so i'm unable *-1 to, to, really take care of a pet###and if that weren't so, i would certainly have one.### i just, i just,###it *exp*-2 frustrates me sometimes * not being able *-1 to have a dog###yeah.###speakera35.###huh.
44674:43	uh, and, and, you know, some people might not believe that	might	###i mean she really could pick up on my mood uh, the way 0 i walked in the door *t*-1.###speakera59.###yeah,###yeah.###speakerb60.###it was, uh, uncanny.###speakera61.###huh.### i, i think, uh, 0 in a way we're able *-2 to read each other pretty well because, uh, she knows when i'm upset *t*-1 and i know when she's not feeling good *t*-3 too.###so. i know 0 like when she has an accident *t*-1,###i know 0 she's not doing it on purpose.###speakerb62.###yeah.###speakera63.### when when she was younger *t*-2, she used *-1 to do that *-3 to get even with me,###speakerb64.###yeah.###speakera65.###speakerb66.###speakera67.
44743:193	well, the, see the problem is 0 if, if the, if someone would have came up to me and said it's going *-1 to cost you five hundred dollars *-2 to keep your dog alive. what do you want *-1 to do *t*-2? i probably would have had second thoughts.	probably	###speakerb84.###ouch.###speakera85.###plus, the, the, uh, the vet sent me a bill for what he did *t*-1###and, uh, then she recouped.###she was okay for a couple of years.###and then she got sick on me again###and i brought her to a different vet this time###and i told the vet what medication i had given her *t*-1 and everything.###and, uh, he gave me the medication, the same medication that i gave her *t*-1 the last time###and she was okay###and she's been okay every since.###it's been about two years now.###speakerb86.###huh.###well, that's great,###it really is *?*.### i, i'm glad that she was able *-1 to pull out of it that way and so cheaply the second time.###speakera87.###yeah.
44857:187	and i think 0 one of the good ways of * solving that is to like, everybody likes *-1 to come to a party so * have a voting party and, uh, you know, like in communities and have the issues there and then everybody go *-2 vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something.	maybe	###speakerb122.###* thank you.###speakera1.###okay.###speakerb2.###okay.###well, uh, do you believe 0 only fifty percent of the people actually vote?###speakera3.###i think 0 it's somewhere really close to that cause i think 0 a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going *-1 to make that much difference.###and they really don't listen to any of the issues anymore.###speakerb4.###huh.###speakera5.###because they feel like so many of the politicians are like crooked, you know?###speakerb6.###uh-huh.###speakera7.###and so they figure why *-2 go out and vote *t*-1, you know.###they're going *-1 to do what they want *-2 to do *t*-3.###they're corrupt anyway.
44885:19	and ma-, maybe * let them have some mock, i mean uh, you know elections and stuff and vote for different people in their classes and start *-1 really young.	maybe	###speakera11.###and i think 0 it does.###we vote every time.###speakerb12.###well, it, uh, there's no question###it does make a difference.###uh, so far, as * having a party and then all voting, uh, when you have different precincts *t*-2, mumblex you would have *-1 to have a party in every precinct.###speakera13.###speakerb14.###speakera15.###right.###speakerb16.###because people have *-1 to vote in different areas###and, uh, not everyone votes at the same place.###speakera17.###speakerb18.###uh, i, personally, think that we need *-1 to do more along the education lines in the schools and the children from the little ones on up, with the idea of the, the value of voting and the purpose of voting and that one vote does make a difference.###but,###speakera19.###right.
44895:10	however, probably not enough of them, uh, country wide.	probably	###right.###speakerb16.###because people have *-1 to vote in different areas###and, uh, not everyone votes at the same place.###speakera17.###speakerb18.###uh, i, personally, think that we need *-1 to do more along the education lines in the schools and the children from the little ones on up, with the idea of the, the value of voting and the purpose of voting and that one vote does make a difference.###but,###speakera19.###right.###and ma-, maybe * let them have some mock, i mean uh, you know elections and stuff and vote for different people in their classes and start *-1 really young.###speakerb20.###absolutely.###speakera21.###speakerb22.###absolutely.###speakera23.###that's a real good idea.###speakerb24.### and, and they are are doing that in a number of schools.
44944:34	and that's the reason 0 i said 0 maybe if you had something like a block party *t*-1.	maybe	###speakera37.###right.###speakerb38.###and we also don't make the, uh, the issues perhaps in language that people fully understand them *t*-1.###speakera39.###yeah.###well i don't know how it is *t*-1 up there###but down here, louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all.###speakerb40.###uh-huh.###speakera41.###i mean, i'm sure 0 you heard about some of ours.###speakerb42.###sure.###speakera43.###speakerb44.###right.###speakera45.###and, uh, people are just,###i mean it's like they're turned *-1 off on voting.
44954:10	like, maybe they could give something	maybe	###speakera41.###i mean, i'm sure 0 you heard about some of ours.###speakerb42.###sure.###speakera43.###speakerb44.###right.###speakera45.###and, uh, people are just,###i mean it's like they're turned *-1 off on voting.###and that's the reason 0 i said 0 maybe if you had something like a block party *t*-1.###speakerb46.###uh-huh.###speakera47.###okay,###we're going *-1 to have a block party.###everybody's going *-1 to get together.###we're going *-1 to discuss the different issues and stuff###and then we're going *-1 to go and vote, you know.###we're going *-1 to go *-2 vote
44996:18	and, uh, maybe if they, like you said, if they would start when little kids and start *-1 letting them vote and learn how * to vote and all *t*-3. then, uh, and the importance of it because, okay, if you don't vote for your friend over here, well your friend's not going *-2 to have a chance.	maybe	###uh-huh.###right.###speakera55.###because the way 0 i feel *t*-2 is 0 if i don't vote, then i don't have any reason, 0 * to gripe *t*-1.###speakerb56.###speakera57.###speakerb58.###to complain about it,###right?###speakera59.###right.###speakerb60.###right.###speakera61.###and i hear so many people saying well i wish 0 this would change,###i wish that### and, you know, but they didn't go *-1 vote.###speakerb62.###that's right.###speakera63.
45029:14	and, uh, certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that, you know, they, they understood that the principles of the country were established *-1 so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant *t*-2	certainly	###speakerb68.###yes.###uh-huh.###speakera69.###but they should start that a lot earlier.###speakerb70.###yeah.###i,###it's the same way with everything in education though.###it should begin and right down in the first grade.###uh, and your very best teachers in my estimation should be first, second or third grade. so that the children develop good learning patterns###and you have some success and want *-1 to go on *-2 learning and continue *-2 learning, uh and not wait until they're in high school###speakera71.###right.###speakerb72.###and then it *exp*-1's too late * to try *-2 to change them around at that point.###speakera73.###yeah.###speakerb74.###but, uh, everything should be started *-1 on the lower levels
45070:14	they would understand probably by the time 0 they were in high school *t*-1,	probably	###speakera85.###you know a good i-, idea for the young kids like that too, is * to have like a a mock one.###and, okay, this, this candidate tells you some things that *t*-1 are going *-2 to happen###speakerb86.###sure.###speakera87.###and this candidate tells you some things.###speakerb88.###right.###speakera89.###okay, then this percentage of the voters, i mean the kids in that class, they are not going *-1 to let them vote this time###but they have *-1 to do whatever these people, whichever one the other people elect *t*-2 do *t*-3.###speakerb90.###uh-huh.###speakera91.###if they did something like that and started kids out *-3 real young and showed them, okay now you're not going *-1 to get *-2 to vote###but you're going *-1 to have *-2 to do what that person says *t*-3,###speakerb92.###yes.###speakera93.
45078:125	they would put them *-4 to realize that, that they're going *-1 to have *-2 to do what someone else says *t*-5 even though they didn't vote for it. and that maybe they need *-3 to think twice about *-6 voting.	maybe	###right.###speakera89.###okay, then this percentage of the voters, i mean the kids in that class, they are not going *-1 to let them vote this time###but they have *-1 to do whatever these people, whichever one the other people elect *t*-2 do *t*-3.###speakerb90.###uh-huh.###speakera91.###if they did something like that and started kids out *-3 real young and showed them, okay now you're not going *-1 to get *-2 to vote###but you're going *-1 to have *-2 to do what that person says *t*-3,###speakerb92.###yes.###speakera93.###they would understand probably by the time 0 they were in high school *t*-1,###speakerb94.###right.###speakera95.###they'd be ready *-1 to vote.###speakerb96.###that's right.###and i think, you know, 0 that's an excellent idea.

45381:18	i mean, some maybe	maybe	###i do, too.###speakerb62.###speakera63.###yeah.###speakerb64.###but i think 0 it really helps them to understand when, when they go to other people's houses *t*-1###and they have pets,###i see so many times kids just, you know,###they, mean to animals *-1 not really understanding that the animals have feelings.###speakera65.###yeah,###exactly,###that or, or, uh, the other extreme,### they're, they're terrified of them###and i hate that,###speakerb66.###yeah,###yeah.###speakera67.###and they shouldn't be *?*,

47213:8	they probably just don't spend as much money as a lot of other states might *?*.	probably	###speakerb28.###well, it, it's, uh,###speakera29.###an area.###speakerb30.###actually the, the blue ridge in virginia are closer to raleigh.###they're about three hours away if you go due north.###speakera31.###uh-huh.###speakerb32.###um, of###the blue ridge in north carolina i think are much nicer###and you can pick those up *-1 going west,###but then you're talking about six to eight hours.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###the way 0 it works *t*-1.###but, um, it's a real, it's a real nice place 0 * to go and camp *t*-1,###and there's some pretty decent campgrounds although, i don't think 0 raleigh, i don't think 0 the state of north carolina takes,
47213:49	they probably just don't spend as much money as a lot of other states might *?*.	might	###speakerb28.###well, it, it's, uh,###speakera29.###an area.###speakerb30.###actually the, the blue ridge in virginia are closer to raleigh.###they're about three hours away if you go due north.###speakera31.###uh-huh.###speakerb32.###um, of###the blue ridge in north carolina i think are much nicer###and you can pick those up *-1 going west,###but then you're talking about six to eight hours.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###the way 0 it works *t*-1.###but, um, it's a real, it's a real nice place 0 * to go and camp *t*-1,###and there's some pretty decent campgrounds although, i don't think 0 raleigh, i don't think 0 the state of north carolina takes,
47233:24	you know, you really can probably count thousands of stars,	probably	###they probably just don't spend as much money as a lot of other states might *?*.###speakera35.###uh-huh.###yeah,###my wife's from the western part of virginia,###we've been down the parkway a lot,###but i didn't know how much, how much camping areas there were *t*-1 along there.###speakerb36.###i think 0 there's quite a few.###i can't say 0 i've checked them all out though.###speakera37.### what, what's it *exp*-2 like *t*-1 * camping in the desert and california,###that seems, like a challenge.###speakerb38.### it's, uh, it's actually kind of incredible,###speakera39.###speakerb40.###it's really, really nice.###um, i like it better than almost anything 0 i've ever done *t*-1.###just the sky is so amazing.
47282:36	the days, get up into the high eighties, uh, maybe the nineties	maybe	###are the temperatures real extreme there###or the, the,###speakerb50.###they can be *?*,###yeah.###i mean, you got *-1 to, you sort of have *-2 to choose your season carefully and know what *t*-3's going *-4 to happen.###speakera51.###uh-huh.###speakerb52.###i've been camping in death valley,###one doesn't go in july.###speakera53.###yeah,###true.###speakerb54.###but it's beautiful in february.###speakera55.###yeah.###speakerb56.###i mean, it's just beautiful.
47466:5	maybe it was the other new york team which *t*-1 is the yankees,	maybe	###speakerb30.###well, i can tell you, that the mets opened, i think *rnr*-1, two days ago,###speakera31.###speakerb32.###speakera33.###uh-huh.###speakerb34.###because my brother was supposed *-1 to go to the opening game,###and i couldn't tell you who *t*-1 pitched,###speakera35.###uh-huh.###speakerb36.###but they won,###the mets won.###speakera37.###did they?###speakerb38.###but, yeah,###not my a lot,###and then somebody else lost,
47683:8	you probably can't afford *-1 to eat if you have more than two of them.	probably	###she married###and they have twelve children.###speakerb106.###twelve children?###speakera107.###she has twelve children.###speakerb108.###oh, my god, the poor woman.###speakera109.###she looks gorgeous,###no###she's gorgeous###and she just liked *-1 having kids###and she's thin###and, i mean, mumblex four or more children are thin,###speakerb110.###were any of them twins?###speakera111.###i mean, i'm not kidding you.###speakerb112.
47729:8	he probably has an income of thirty-five thousand,	probably	###whose toothbrush did you really use *t*-1 this morning.###speakerb118.###but how do they afford *-1 to even have the kids *t*-2, uh,###we're expecting our first baby, almost any day###speakera119.###uh-huh.###speakerb120.###and,###uh-huh.###speakera121.###they live *-1 lean for one thing###and they tithe###and they###mumblex###it puts mumblex a whole in your money bag,###we don't honor god with this mumblex portion###and so they,###i think 0 that helps a lot.###i think 0 that's the key, in he, like his sales last year###he just works a normal job.
47751:21	you're just as blessed, probably more, because if you follow this,	probably	###that got him a bonus of twenty-five thousand which *t*-1 allowed him to pay cash for a full size van.###speakerb122.###speakera123.###he loves god,###i mean, it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done *t*-1,###speakerb124.###wow.###speakera125.###and he got *-1 to do it###and so god just really blesses him in ways like that,###* do trust god because, i don't know, kids are a blessing### and, and some people mumblex you know, we think of blessings as nice furniture and things like that,###but kids are just as much of a blessing inside these material things###but it's a different kind###and a lot times people think, oh, well, i'm not blessed###i have an old car.###but you've got five kids, you know,###speakerb126.###uh-huh.###speakera127.
47793:42	but, um, it's kind of a different situation because you're probably living in an apartment, right?	probably	###but a lot women die or shop at foley's###so things,###speakerb132.### i, i don't know what foley's is *t*-1.###speakera133.###it's like a macy's, kind of store,###speakerb134.###uh-huh.###speakera135.###it's pretty nice###and everything's pretty expensive###and, you know, you just can't do that###and you don't go to baseball games as much###or you get pictures like we did.###you know what i mean *t*-1?###speakerb136.###yeah.###speakera137.###you do these fun things, you know, in other kinds of ways###and i know 0 manhattan's real expensive
47966:28	well, that, that certainly can happen now if	certainly	###and we went *-1 skating a lot###and, you know, she was just always there for us,###but nowadays if there are two parents to a family, the mother works just as hard as the father does,###and the children either stay at home and get into trouble###or they're stuck in a day care.###and i just, i just don't want my children to have *-1 to be raised *-2 like that.###all my friends, they, their parents worked all the time,###they got *-1 to stay at home by themselves###and when i was younger *t*-1 i thought 0 they were lucky because they got *-2 to get away with things, like i couldn't ride my bike across the street, but they could *?* because their mom would never know it.###speakerb34.###uh-huh.###speakera35.###speakerb36.###yeah.###speakera37.###but now i realize that it was better because, um, they have got into a lot of trouble, because of lack of supervision.###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###speakera39.###speakerb40.
48053:32	usually, uh, my husband was seldom home for maybe forty-five minutes or so	maybe	###speakera73.###what did you teach *t*-1?###speakerb74.###i taught physical education.###speakera75.###oh, oh, i started out as a p e major, in education.###speakerb76.###uh-huh.###speakera77.###i wanted *-1 to be a p e teacher.###speakerb78.###well,###speakera79.###i sure did.###speakerb80.### i, uh, i found that, uh, it was a perfect combination from the standpoint of * having vacations off at the same time.###speakera81.###oh, yeah.###speakerb82.### and, uh, and it worked out fine from that standpoint, uh, plus the fact that, uh, when i left *t*-1, uh,
48120:15	and we certainly, uh, we need more of that,	certainly	###that's right.###speakera99.###but we did### and, and we lived in a trailer for eighteen years.###speakerb100.###huh.###speakera101.###and, um, you know, we, we only had one car,###we only had one telephone, you know,###speakerb102.###uh-huh.###speakera103.###we didn't get *-1 to eat out all the time###but i, i feel like that it helped me now because i appreciate the value of the dollar,###speakerb104.###right.###speakera105.###and, um, i also had the supervision that i needed *t*-1 while i was growing up,###and i hope that i can provide that for my child too.###speakerb106.
48216:92	well, on a scale of one to ten, uh, being *ich*-1 ten, no, kind of legislation and zero being, uh, total ban, i probably would lean more towards six or seven.	probably	###he, uh, works, uh, for a different company.###yeah,###in the dallas area###but when he went away to coll- *t*-1,###and he was on the lawns from the time 0 he was in the seventh grade and, uh, a small mumblex and all the way through college###and he held three jobs. wally was in college###and we didn't even know it.###speakera139.###oh, goodness.###speakerb140.###he didn't even tell us. uh, that he had three jobs###speakera141.###speakerb142.###but when he graduated *t*-1 he had a five thousand dollar bank account###and, uh, we had told him that if he ever wanted *-1 to go to college he could go,###if he got married *-1 he was on his own,###if he flunked out he was on his own...###speakera1.###well, stephanie, what's your position on gun control *t*-1?###speakerb2.
48247:10	but it certainly didn't get any better.	certainly	###speakerb6.### any, any kind of firearms.###speakera7.###really?###speakerb8.###yeah.###uh, it's,###there's was a mandatory jail sentence if you were caught *-1, um, with a firearm###and also i think 0 there was a fine.###speakera9.###and that didn't help at all?###speakerb10.###no,###i don't,### the, the crime is not any better or any worse,###i mean it's,###speakera11.###huh.###speakerb12.### i, i shouldn't say 0 i don't know if it was any worse,
48256:13	but you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature, uh, you know,	definitely	###speakera9.###and that didn't help at all?###speakerb10.###no,###i don't,### the, the crime is not any better or any worse,###i mean it's,###speakera11.###huh.###speakerb12.### i, i shouldn't say 0 i don't know if it was any worse,###but it certainly didn't get any better.###speakera13.###uh-huh.###i usually just,###i'm trying *-1 to think of,###i guess 0 i would tend myself *-1 to be more towards the, the, like three, where i don't think 0 you should necessarily ban guns any, by any means *t*-2,###speakerb14.###uh-huh.###speakera15.
48284:7	and maybe they just don't report those	maybe	### i, i think that the, the law is on who *t*-1 can buy a gun are, are way too lax.###speakera19.###uh-huh,###exactly.###speakerb20.### i think that, i think that the,###speakera21.###and, so, i think 0 that kind of control is, would be good,###speakerb22.###yeah.###speakera23.###but the, uh,### i, you know, i'm trying *-1 to think of how many times you make the statement *t*-2 and, just to kind of exam it a little bit###and i, i know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true, uh,###only the guns were in the hands of the criminals,###but how many times,###i guess 0 i have never heard of a, a robbery being foiled *-1 or spoiled *-1 because the person who *t*-2's being robbed *-3 had a gun.###speakerb24.###um, i,###speakera25.
48296:30	um, and i don't think 0 i probably ever would *?*, um, although i would like *-1 to know how *-2 to handle one *t*-3,	probably	### i, you know, i'm trying *-1 to think of how many times you make the statement *t*-2 and, just to kind of exam it a little bit###and i, i know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true, uh,###only the guns were in the hands of the criminals,###but how many times,###i guess 0 i have never heard of a, a robbery being foiled *-1 or spoiled *-1 because the person who *t*-2's being robbed *-3 had a gun.###speakerb24.###um, i,###speakera25.###and maybe they just don't report those###or i'm not sure###or, you know, i can't think of *-1 ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who *t*-2 was being robbed *-3###but good thing 0 they had their gun on them###and they, they thwarted the robbery attempt.###speakerb26.###yeah,### i, i'm, i'm not really sure,### i don't, personally i don't own a gun,###speakera27.###uh-huh.###speakerb28.
48301:30	um, you just never know when you might come into contact with one *t*-1.	might	###speakerb24.###um, i,###speakera25.###and maybe they just don't report those###or i'm not sure###or, you know, i can't think of *-1 ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who *t*-2 was being robbed *-3###but good thing 0 they had their gun on them###and they, they thwarted the robbery attempt.###speakerb26.###yeah,### i, i'm, i'm not really sure,### i don't, personally i don't own a gun,###speakera27.###uh-huh.###speakerb28.###um, and i don't think 0 i probably ever would *?*, um, although i would like *-1 to know how *-2 to handle one *t*-3,### and i think 0 it's good that everyb-, and i think 0 everybody should learn how *-2 to handle one *t*-3.###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb30.
48344:63	most of that's done *-1 with rifles and such. uh, though there's, you know, probably i'm sure 0 *t*-3 some sector that *t*-2 does it with handguns.	probably	###speakerb40.###and my, really my only experience with a gun was * shooting a pistol and not knowing how *-1 to hold it right *t*-2###and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb###and blood squirted everywhere.###speakera41.###oh, jeez.###speakerb42.###and so that was really the only experience *ich*-2 that i've had *t*-1 with guns###and it, it kind of scared me.###speakera43.###right.###speakerb44.###speakera45.###uh-huh.###speakerb46.###but i think that if i learn how *-1 to use one *t*-2, i would, i would feel better.###speakera47.###right.###i've also always thought about the idea 0, you know, most sports, you know, which *t*-1 are###the n r a and people have their thing, you know, 0 if you ban guns, you're just banning the, the recreation, the sport of hunting, things of that nature.
48361:28	but i, i think definitely,	definitely	###right.###i've also always thought about the idea 0, you know, most sports, you know, which *t*-1 are###the n r a and people have their thing, you know, 0 if you ban guns, you're just banning the, the recreation, the sport of hunting, things of that nature.###most of that's done *-1 with rifles and such. uh, though there's, you know, probably i'm sure 0 *t*-3 some sector that *t*-2 does it with handguns.###but just by the mere fact of * outlawing handguns, would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous,###you couldn't be inconspicuous, when you walked into a store stuff like that *t*-1,###speakerb48.###yeah.###speakera49.###you could see someone coming or dressed *-1 inappropriately, you know,### you-, if they had *-1 to have a rifle or was, you know,###* made it more difficult * to get a, a, uh, a handgun.###now of course, you know, in this world anytime 0 you've freedom *t*-1 you can be able *-2 to get anything 0 you want *t*-3.###speakerb50.###yeah,###that's true.###speakera51.###but i guess * to make it more difficult for the person who *t*-1's just so irate and upset and, you know, temporarily a little bit, uh, offset or off keel,###i don't know if that's a large percentage of, uh, crime or not###but i guess 0 it would be some.
48368:11	i would definitely support that.	definitely	###yeah.###speakera49.###you could see someone coming or dressed *-1 inappropriately, you know,### you-, if they had *-1 to have a rifle or was, you know,###* made it more difficult * to get a, a, uh, a handgun.###now of course, you know, in this world anytime 0 you've freedom *t*-1 you can be able *-2 to get anything 0 you want *t*-3.###speakerb50.###yeah,###that's true.###speakera51.###but i guess * to make it more difficult for the person who *t*-1's just so irate and upset and, you know, temporarily a little bit, uh, offset or off keel,###i don't know if that's a large percentage of, uh, crime or not###but i guess 0 it would be some.###but i, i think definitely,###like today they just introduced the, what *t*-1's called *-2 the brady bill. the seven day mandatory waiting period, on * getting any guns.###speakerb52.###uh-huh.###speakera53.###and i think that, shoot that's a good idea.###speakerb54.
48372:123	i, i, i agree 0 the thing *ich*-2 that *t*-1 scares me, uh, though about where i would, i would wa-, definitely want some sort of legislation *t*-3	definitely	###* made it more difficult * to get a, a, uh, a handgun.###now of course, you know, in this world anytime 0 you've freedom *t*-1 you can be able *-2 to get anything 0 you want *t*-3.###speakerb50.###yeah,###that's true.###speakera51.###but i guess * to make it more difficult for the person who *t*-1's just so irate and upset and, you know, temporarily a little bit, uh, offset or off keel,###i don't know if that's a large percentage of, uh, crime or not###but i guess 0 it would be some.###but i, i think definitely,###like today they just introduced the, what *t*-1's called *-2 the brady bill. the seven day mandatory waiting period, on * getting any guns.###speakerb52.###uh-huh.###speakera53.###and i think that, shoot that's a good idea.###speakerb54.###i would definitely support that.###speakera55.###speakerb56.###yeah.
48502:105	and we use the computers a great deal for word processing, you know, because students really do seem *-1 to be freer when they write on the computer *t*-2, as you probably found out yourself,	probably	###speakerb24.###uh-huh,###so she took it with her.###speakera25.###speakerb26.###yeah,###* don't blame her.###speakera27.###she just finished up her bachelor's degree###speakerb28.###uh-huh.###speakera29.###so i don't know if she's going *-1 to even use it anymore.### it, it's,###speakerb30.###yeah.###oh, well, well, * encourage her to try other things,###because, um, i am, uh,###i work in a school system,###and i teach writing
48680:26	and even for a personal computer it's probably smart * to spend that much,	probably	###they can't do your, um, your drafting and your graphs, and all of that.###speakerb94.###speakera95.###speakerb96.###no,###you can't do very much on them.###speakera97.###speakerb98.###right.###right.###um, well, it's just that you have *-1 to have, uh, you have *-2 to be able *-3 to get your program in,### and, and, m-, many of the programs are so big, uh,###speakera99.###speakerb100.###they take up so much space that you don't have any place *ich*-1 then 0 * to work *t*-2.###you don't have any, bytes left *###speakera101.###yeah?###speakerb102.###but, um, if you, um, if, if you want *-1 to go into one that *t*-2's really useful, you're going *-3 to have *-4 to go over a thousand dollars,
48762:23	um, i think 0 it might have a spelling editor on it,	might	###speakera127.###yeah.###well, she likes it,###she gets *-1 to write her reports,###but like i say, she could have bought a much cheaper model and done what she wanted *t*-1.###speakerb128.###yeah.###speakera129.###speakerb130.###and she could have bought a typewriter also.###speakera131.###yeah,###a typewriter with memory would, would have been fine,###speakerb132.###yeah,###speakera133.###it's all 0 she ev-, uses it for *t*-1.###speakerb134.###yeah.###speakera135.
48832:14	and that's probably the way 0 i feel *t*-4 about it is, is, uh, it kind of depends on the crime that *t*-2's committed *-3.	probably	###speakerb150.###i need *-1 to go *-2 help my daughter do something,###so this has been fun * talking to you.###speakera151.###okay,###good.###speakerb152.###speakera153.###okay.###speakerb154.###good luck.###speakera155.###yeah,###well, bye.###speakerb156.###uh, bye-bye.###speakera1.###i guess 0 i don-, don't really have a problem with capital punishment.###i'm not really sure what the exact, uh, specifications are *t*-1 for texas.###i know that they, uh, have capital punishment for certain crimes,
48841:5	probably pretty similar views on it,	probably	###speakerb154.###good luck.###speakera155.###yeah,###well, bye.###speakerb156.###uh, bye-bye.###speakera1.###i guess 0 i don-, don't really have a problem with capital punishment.###i'm not really sure what the exact, uh, specifications are *t*-1 for texas.###i know that they, uh, have capital punishment for certain crimes,###and that's probably the way 0 i feel *t*-4 about it is, is, uh, it kind of depends on the crime that *t*-2's committed *-3.###my belief all my life, i guess 0 *t*-1, has been that, that if you take someone else's life, then you automatically are giving up, uh, yours in place of it.###but i don't,###* seems *-1 to be a lot of controversy about that.###speakerb2.###yeah.###speakera3.###speakerb4.###uh, uh, i tend *-1 to agree with you, uh, you know,
48847:35	well, there's, there's probably two or three different types of, of views as far as the controversy goes.	probably	###uh, bye-bye.###speakera1.###i guess 0 i don-, don't really have a problem with capital punishment.###i'm not really sure what the exact, uh, specifications are *t*-1 for texas.###i know that they, uh, have capital punishment for certain crimes,###and that's probably the way 0 i feel *t*-4 about it is, is, uh, it kind of depends on the crime that *t*-2's committed *-3.###my belief all my life, i guess 0 *t*-1, has been that, that if you take someone else's life, then you automatically are giving up, uh, yours in place of it.###but i don't,###* seems *-1 to be a lot of controversy about that.###speakerb2.###yeah.###speakera3.###speakerb4.###uh, uh, i tend *-1 to agree with you, uh, you know,###probably pretty similar views on it,###but that's, that's one of the things 0 i don't, don't understand *t*-1 is, is so much of the controversy###because, uh, you know, i, i do also, myself, believe in capital punishment, uh,###uh, you know, it, it *exp*-5 really irks me * to see so much effort put *-1 into * preventing someone being put *-2 to death by the state when they so callously and usually so, you know, without *-3 even thinking or without any concern, uh, you know, end somebody else's life, and in a lot of cases several people's lives *t*-6.###speakera5.###that's true. i guess 0 *t*-1,
48892:32	and that's, that's certainly no kind of deterrent,	certainly	###uh-huh.###yeah,### it's, it's just 0 our criminal system is just so, i guess, overloaded,###but the, you know, the, the problem is not so much with the prison system, you know,###i mean, because the, the cops are out there *-1 doing their job enforcing the laws,###and the prison system are just, you know,###they're trying *-1 to cope with them,###but, you know, the thing about capital punishment i-, i, you know,###a lot of people don't think 0 it would be a deterrent, uh, to, to future crime,###and the way 0 it is *t*-1 now, it's not *?*.###speakera13.###no.###speakerb14.###because, you know, you,###if like###the state of texas, for example, may, uh, you know, may execute somebody twice a year.###you know, that's, that's no kind of deterrent because we, we've got literally hundreds of people on death row, and, and many of them who *t*-1 have been there *ich*-2 for literally for ten or fifteen years on death row,###speakera15.###right.###speakerb16.
48898:15	and you can, probably spend, uh, a lot of time, uh, or * maybe eventually, uh, just waiting it out,	probably	###they're trying *-1 to cope with them,###but, you know, the thing about capital punishment i-, i, you know,###a lot of people don't think 0 it would be a deterrent, uh, to, to future crime,###and the way 0 it is *t*-1 now, it's not *?*.###speakera13.###no.###speakerb14.###because, you know, you,###if like###the state of texas, for example, may, uh, you know, may execute somebody twice a year.###you know, that's, that's no kind of deterrent because we, we've got literally hundreds of people on death row, and, and many of them who *t*-1 have been there *ich*-2 for literally for ten or fifteen years on death row,###speakera15.###right.###speakerb16.###and that's, that's certainly no kind of deterrent,###and i would tend *-1 to agree with anybody who *t*-2 says right now that it, it's not a terrent, a deterrent, because it's not *?*.###speakera17.###no,###it's not *?*.###you think of your chances of * getting the death penalty after * cre-, uh, committing a crime are really pretty slim right now.
48898:54	and you can, probably spend, uh, a lot of time, uh, or * maybe eventually, uh, just waiting it out,	maybe	###they're trying *-1 to cope with them,###but, you know, the thing about capital punishment i-, i, you know,###a lot of people don't think 0 it would be a deterrent, uh, to, to future crime,###and the way 0 it is *t*-1 now, it's not *?*.###speakera13.###no.###speakerb14.###because, you know, you,###if like###the state of texas, for example, may, uh, you know, may execute somebody twice a year.###you know, that's, that's no kind of deterrent because we, we've got literally hundreds of people on death row, and, and many of them who *t*-1 have been there *ich*-2 for literally for ten or fifteen years on death row,###speakera15.###right.###speakerb16.###and that's, that's certainly no kind of deterrent,###and i would tend *-1 to agree with anybody who *t*-2 says right now that it, it's not a terrent, a deterrent, because it's not *?*.###speakera17.###no,###it's not *?*.###you think of your chances of * getting the death penalty after * cre-, uh, committing a crime are really pretty slim right now.
49054:8	it might be,	might	###i live in a development,###uh, it's a relatively, i would say, well,###god, it sounds like, sounds like i'm bragging.###speakera9.###no,###that's okay.###speakerb10.###but it's upper middle class, uh, kind of an environment.###speakera11.###okay.###speakerb12.###it's a two story colonial, which my wife and i designed *t*-1.###speakera13.###oh, that's neat.###speakerb14.###uh, it has around thirty-two hundred square feet. uh, five bedrooms and so forth and so on,###speakera15.###wow, that's large.###speakerb16.###and it is, i would imagine 0 in terms of, of size and so forth, it's relatively typical for the area.
49055:24	i would say 0 it's probably midsized for the area.	probably	###uh, it's a relatively, i would say, well,###god, it sounds like, sounds like i'm bragging.###speakera9.###no,###that's okay.###speakerb10.###but it's upper middle class, uh, kind of an environment.###speakera11.###okay.###speakerb12.###it's a two story colonial, which my wife and i designed *t*-1.###speakera13.###oh, that's neat.###speakerb14.###uh, it has around thirty-two hundred square feet. uh, five bedrooms and so forth and so on,###speakera15.###wow, that's large.###speakerb16.###and it is, i would imagine 0 in terms of, of size and so forth, it's relatively typical for the area.###it might be,
49064:18	it is, uh, probably ten years old.	probably	###speakerb12.###it's a two story colonial, which my wife and i designed *t*-1.###speakera13.###oh, that's neat.###speakerb14.###uh, it has around thirty-two hundred square feet. uh, five bedrooms and so forth and so on,###speakera15.###wow, that's large.###speakerb16.###and it is, i would imagine 0 in terms of, of size and so forth, it's relatively typical for the area.###it might be,###i would say 0 it's probably midsized for the area.###there are some smaller,###and there are, s-, you know, several larger.###speakera17.###uh-huh.###speakerb18.### and, uh, but based, you know, in terms of, you know, in, in pensacola, in that area of florida it, uh, it's what now,###speakera19.###speakerb20.
49075:47	* let's say 0 compared to maryland, that same house here would probably cost three-quarters of a million dollars	probably	###i would say 0 it's probably midsized for the area.###there are some smaller,###and there are, s-, you know, several larger.###speakera17.###uh-huh.###speakerb18.### and, uh, but based, you know, in terms of, you know, in, in pensacola, in that area of florida it, uh, it's what now,###speakera19.###speakerb20.###it is, uh, probably ten years old.###speakera21.###oh, well, that's not too bad,###speakerb22.###yeah.###speakera23.###that's still fairly new.###speakerb24.###and so it's,###in terms of cost and, and, and size and so forth, it, uh,###the hou-, you know, housing there is extremely affordable, and, uh, compared to other parts of the country, you know,
49175:18	uh, reasonable construction would probably run you, uh, right now anywhere between, somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars.	probably	###mumblex a new carrier *ich*-1 was coming in and, uh, the, uh, attendant, uh, support vessels.###well, that's no longer, the case.###speakera59.###so, do you think,###speakerb60.###speakera61.###it was overdeveloped then?###speakerb62.###oh, it's, it is *?*.###i mean, the, the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population.###speakera63.###wow.###speakerb64.###and so i-, overbuilding is, i-, has been a real problem there.###speakera65.###um.###speakerb66.###so you can still get a, get a, a good house for a very, very reasonable price.###and i mean good, i would,###* let's say typical, say three bedroom, uh, two and a half baths, on a half acre or so of land,
49176:7	and probably, perhaps, cheaper, depending upon the neighborhood.	probably	###well, that's no longer, the case.###speakera59.###so, do you think,###speakerb60.###speakera61.###it was overdeveloped then?###speakerb62.###oh, it's, it is *?*.###i mean, the, the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population.###speakera63.###wow.###speakerb64.###and so i-, overbuilding is, i-, has been a real problem there.###speakera65.###um.###speakerb66.###so you can still get a, get a, a good house for a very, very reasonable price.###and i mean good, i would,###* let's say typical, say three bedroom, uh, two and a half baths, on a half acre or so of land,###uh, reasonable construction would probably run you, uh, right now anywhere between, somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars.
49231:46	like most areas that *t*-1 are built *-2, um, there were probably, like two or three styles 0 you could choose from *t*-1.	probably	###speakerb82.###speakera83.###but, um, anyway, it's, uh, it's pretty, also pretty typical for the area.###most of this area was developed,###this house was built *-1 in seventy-four.###speakerb84.###uh-huh.###speakera85.###so most of the,###it's almost twenty years old,###and most of the houses around here were built *t*-1 *-2 pretty much the same style.###uh, we have a friend that *t*-1 lives two blocks over,###and his house is almost identical to us, except 0 his is three bedrooms and ours is four###speakerb86.###uh-huh.###speakera87.###but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same.###so i, i think 0 most of them are *?*###there was,###it,

49313:207	on a, on a, on a, what we would, you know, what you described *t*-2 as your house and what i would describe *t*-1 as my house say, for example, in pensacola, florida, on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on, * might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes.	might	###yes.### i, i can't, i can't envision *-1 spending that much money, and on, on something along those lines.###speakera113.###sure.###speakerb114.###speakera115.###yeah.###speakerb116.###so, you know, it's,### y-, i guess 0 you pay the piper### but, plus the, the, the taxes around here are phenomenally, high.###speakera117.###right.###speakerb118.###speakera119.###oh, yeah.###speakerb120.###uh, for the,###and so, you, on that,###it's not unusual, for example, for somewhere around here

49331:107	uh, so, the question of whether * to buy here or move to another county, say, drive twenty more miles north, buy a condominium for approximately, uh, the same price, maybe a little lower,	maybe	###and so, you, on that,###it's not unusual, for example, for somewhere around here### on a, on a, on a, what we would, you know, what you described *t*-2 as your house and what i would describe *t*-1 as my house say, for example, in pensacola, florida, on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on, * might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes.### may-, maybe, you know, maybe a little bit higher than that now,###speakera121.###wow.###speakerb122.###speakera123.###yeah.###speakerb124.###but that same house here, you'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year, taxes on it.###speakera125.###speakerb126.###speakera127.###wow.###speakerb128.###speakera129.###wow, that's,###speakerb130.###so, it's,

49526:10	the mazda definitely did not.	definitely	###and for everything 0 i've heard *t*-1 it's a lot easier * to sell an automatic.###speakerb45.###yeah,###it is *?*.###speakera46.### and, and resale value is really important to me.###speakerb47.###that's true.###speakera48.###speakerb49.###yeah,###it is me too###that's why i got the honda *t*-1.###speakera50.###yeah.###speakerb51.###hondas have great resale value.###speakera52.###yeah.###speakerb53.
49558:9	so, probably what i'll do *t*-1 again.	probably	###right.###speakera58.###and it had some, some nice features.###so i ended up okay with the buick,###speakerb59.###good.###speakera60.###and i anticipate the same thing with the honda whenever i decide *-1 to sell it *t*-2,###of course, i may never sell it,###speakerb61.###right.###speakera62.###i may drive it until it's dead###but,###speakerb63.###yeah.###that's what i did *t*-1 with the mazda, * drive it until the, until the clutch went out and the wheels fell off,###speakera64.###yeah.###speakerb65.
49639:11	mine was definitely not impulse	definitely	###but they're so wonderful.###speakera90.###yeah.###i went there *-1 looking at a used car###and two days later i bought this car.###speakerb91.###speakera92.### i felt like, i felt like that was the worst impulse, that was, that was largest impulse that i, that i had ever made *t*-1.###speakerb93.###speakera94.### the oth-, the two, other things that i bought *t*-1 on impulse are a v c r and a washer, and dryer.###speakerb95.###i understand.###speakera96.###speakerb97.###speakera98.###i go for the big stuff.###speakerb99.###yeah.###i noticed.
49744:31	well, i think 0 we're on, maybe.	maybe	###bye-bye.###speakerb1.###i guess 0 we're on.###speakera2.###well, * hang on###* let me try it again because usually, um.###speakerb3.###do you usually get a message?###speakera4.###yeah.###speakerb5.###um.###speakera6.###um.###speakerb7.###* hang on###* let me check on it.###i don't know.###speakera8.###well, * let me try it once more.
49814:181	but i think, uh, actually, uh, in, in *-3 trying *-1 to follow, uh, you know the cowboys over the years i think, uh, uh, 0 they used *-2 to have a, um, a philosophy for, well i don't know, probably the last twenty-five years except for about the last about five or six years uh,	probably	###uh-huh.###speakera30.###speakerb31.###oh, yeah.###speakera32.###and, uh, uh, unfortunately, of course, the cowboys have been doing so bad in the past few years.###speakerb33.###uh-huh.###speakera34.###that, uh, uh,###i don't know,###everybody's kind of,###they're still behind them###but, uh, it's not like 0 it used *-1 to be *t*-2.###speakerb35.###yeah.###well, you know, you, you back the winners###and you don't back them when they're not doing well *t*-1.###speakera36.###that's right.
49908:73	spring training until you actually start *-1 going out and getting, uh, getting out against the competition everything probably looks pretty good.	probably	###okay.###my brain is really working well tonight.###speakera64.###that's okay,###they, um, um,###i've got a friend that, uh, *t*-1 lives right next to the cowboys' training camp.###speakerb65.###uh-huh.###speakera66.###and, uh, uh, he gets, he sees them out *-1 running a lot###and every once in a while * gets a chance * to talk to some of the guys###and they're all, uh, they're all thinking that, uh, man, they, they, they really got something going this year,###speakerb67.###uh-huh.###speakera68.###but i, i guess, uh, 0 when you have a whole bunch of, uh, professional athletes that *t*-1 get together at the beginning of the year *t*-2 everybody's got great hopes.###you, know, i guess 0 it's the same way with baseball or, or anybody, you know,###speakerb69.###uh-huh.###speakera70.
49960:203	but, of course, you know, the, the, the one, the griping is that if, you know, if, if washington doesn't get a, uh, a baseball team then baltimore shouldn't get a football team. which *t*-1 is probably true,	probably	###yeah,###i enjoyed that because it was against the skins.###speakera84.###well, you don't, uh, you don't like the skins?###speakerb85.###um, no.### i, i, i live near baltimore###and, um, um, i, i really don't like d c a whole lot at all.###speakera86.###oh, okay.###speakerb87.###and, um, i mean, i'm really,### they're, they, they got a big thing because of the, you know, the, the expansion going on in baseball.###d c is like talking about how, how they're going *-1 to get a baseball team and everything *t*-2.###it's like you guys aren't going *-1 to get a baseball team,###i'm sorry###it's not going *-2 to happen.###speakera88.###jeez.###speakerb89.
50200:18	and it's certainly, and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years.	certainly	###uh-huh.###speakera25.###and until he starts *-1 doing something so inhumane that the u n gets involved, then it's nobody's business.###speakerb26.###that's right.###speakera27.###um,###speakerb28.###i mean these, these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time.###speakera29.###all the time.###i mean, yeah,###i mean,###speakerb30.###some of them have been going on for, for tens of years, if, if i understand it right in places like the sudan and,###speakera31.###yeah.###speakerb32.###speakera33.###yeah,
50200:34	and it's certainly, and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years.	certainly	###uh-huh.###speakera25.###and until he starts *-1 doing something so inhumane that the u n gets involved, then it's nobody's business.###speakerb26.###that's right.###speakera27.###um,###speakerb28.###i mean these, these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time.###speakera29.###all the time.###i mean, yeah,###i mean,###speakerb30.###some of them have been going on for, for tens of years, if, if i understand it right in places like the sudan and,###speakera31.###yeah.###speakerb32.###speakera33.###yeah,
50368:11	that's probably true,	probably	###speakerb90.###uh-huh.###speakera91.### it's just, it was very strange.###speakerb92.###i believe it.###speakera93.###it was very interesting.###speakerb94.###yeah,###yeah,### i can, i can, i can believe that.###yeah,### i, i don't claim *-1 to have an in-depth understanding by any means,###but, uh,###speakera95.###now i,###shoot,### i, i think 0 some of these people that they claim *t*-1 as middle eastern experts don't, don't have a clue sometimes.###speakerb96.
50369:11	that's probably true.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakera91.### it's just, it was very strange.###speakerb92.###i believe it.###speakera93.###it was very interesting.###speakerb94.###yeah,###yeah,### i can, i can, i can believe that.###yeah,### i, i don't claim *-1 to have an in-depth understanding by any means,###but, uh,###speakera95.###now i,###shoot,### i, i think 0 some of these people that they claim *t*-1 as middle eastern experts don't, don't have a clue sometimes.###speakerb96.###that's probably true,
50831:13	and it was definitely voluntary, too.	definitely	###uh-huh.###speakera55.###speakerb56.###well, i know 0 in,###i personally took a year and a half and went as a missionary and taught christianity in japan.###speakera57.###uh-huh.###speakerb58.###and i was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me.###it taught me *-1 not to be so self-centered and it, you know, to think of others.###speakera59.###uh-huh.###speakerb60.###but i don't know if i was doing it in different situation, you know, not a really religious background, if, if i would get a lot out of it.###you know, i think 0 i did because it, you know, it emphasized that sort of thing.###you know, a lot of self evaluation.###speakera61.###sure.###speakerb62.###speakera63.
50865:23	and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort.	certainly	###um, well, like i say, i know that there are some type of programs that they have *t*-1 available for a youth, like teenagers to go and do, um, work in the national parks and work in, uh, neighborhoods *-2 to do, um, clean up and that sort of thing.###but i don't know what organization it's under *t*-1.###i don't know if it's a government run *rnr*-2 *rnr*-3 or if it's a private *rnr*-2 *rnr*-3 charity that *t*-1's put it together.###speakera69.###i don't either.###speakerb70.###but i know that that helps a lot with training and, um a lot of,###speakera71.###yeah,###out here in california, there's a program like that for, uh, juvenile delinquents,### the, the ones that *t*-1 are not dangerous###speakerb72.###speakera73.###and they don't have *-1 to be locked *-2 up go to these, uh, camps.###and they, do forestry work.###speakerb74.###uh-huh.###speakera75.###they maintain trails###and they, uh, put up signs
50876:11	it's probably a, a very good way 0 * to keep them off the streets and out of trouble *t*-1,	probably	###speakerb72.###speakera73.###and they don't have *-1 to be locked *-2 up go to these, uh, camps.###and they, do forestry work.###speakerb74.###uh-huh.###speakera75.###they maintain trails###and they, uh, put up signs###and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort.###speakerb76.###uh-huh.###speakera77.###and that i know 0 *t*-1 is run *-2 by the state,###but there may be other things.###i'm not so sure what kind of, uh, training *ich*-2 that is *t*-1 for the future for those kids.###speakerb78.###yeah,###how much benefit, it'll do them *t*-1 in the long run?###speakera79.
50961:16	not insofar as * maybe making conversation with somebody, i suppose *t*-2, because it, you can easily be overhear-, overheard *-1	maybe	###well, that, that's not really good.###i don't know,###i guess 0 that's an invasion of privacy.###i'm not sure that that's an everyday thing, though, at least not for, you know, an individual.###speakera15.###uh-huh.###speakerb16.###something that i feel 0 *t*-1 is a, is a, pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that *t*-2's really so common that it's accepted *-3 as the norm now, is the op-, the open office concept.###speakera17.###the open office?###speakerb18.###uh-huh,###where they have the, you know, the little partition dividers, throughout a, a large room *t*-1###speakera19.###yeah.###speakerb20.### and, and people have little cubicles.###well, that's all fine and good,###but you don't really have any privacy at all.###speakera21.
51130:26	i, i can probably go on,	probably	###speakerb76.###so then they can call the credit bureau and say, hey, you know, we're paying you good money *-1 to report this properly###and you're not doing your job.###speakera77.###good idea.###speakerb78.###so that's what i've taken to *-2 doing *t*-1 lately,###and it seems *-1 to work pretty well so far.###speakera79.###uh-huh.###well, that's good.###uh, any other problems?###speakerb80.###not that i can think of *t*-1.###speakera81.###yeah,### i, i guess 0 i've just about run out of,###speakerb82.###yeah.###speakera83.
51135:8	i probably better *-1 let you get back to work.	probably	###speakerb78.###so that's what i've taken to *-2 doing *t*-1 lately,###and it seems *-1 to work pretty well so far.###speakera79.###uh-huh.###well, that's good.###uh, any other problems?###speakerb80.###not that i can think of *t*-1.###speakera81.###yeah,### i, i guess 0 i've just about run out of,###speakerb82.###yeah.###speakera83.### i, i can probably go on,###but it's, it's, uh,###i'm clouding up right now.###speakerb84.###oh, yeah,
51230:40	i mean, the guy's twenty, twenty-five home rums, maybe thirty, eighty some r b i-s.	maybe	###i think 0 that's right.###speakera22.###okay,###yeah,###so * had a lot of fun###actually, i mean, i like minor league baseball, a lot.###it's cheaper for one thing.###speakerb23.###well, that's true.###i think, 0 i've kind of become a rangers fan over the last eleven years since i've been here.###uh, they've led the american league in batting, fielding and pitching,###but they've never been able *-1 to do more than one of those in any, any given year.###so.###speakera24.###yes.###i think 0 they're in for a odd year this year,###actually, um, they, um,###i don't understand why encovilla got released *-1 *t*-2.###speakerb25.###i don't either.
51390:39	i'll be, i'll be upset probably even though my prediction will be right.	probably	###so it's like so much for * going to lots of baseball games.###speakerb79.###all right.###speakera80.###speakerb81.### so, so * do it while you can *?*.###speakera82.###yeah,###seriously.###speakerb83.###sure.###well, it *exp*-1's been good * talking with you.###speakera84.###yeah,###good * talking with you.### and, and you'll be happy i think 0 *t*-2 in october when the dodgers win *t*-1.###speakerb85.###i wouldn't mind it.###speakera86.###yeah,

51958:32	and i'm, i'm probably a little too over protective	probably	###next year she's going *-1 to be five, six years old in kindergarten, in same school with, you know, uh, i guess ten year olds.###isn't that, six, sixth, sixth grade, you know,###speakerb230.###yeah.###speakera231.###and that's a big gap.###speakerb232.###it is *?*.###speakera233.###and that's, uh, that, i can honestly see the peer pressure there.###speakerb234.###uh-huh.###speakera235.###and that, just, terrifies me to death. and stuff,###speakerb236.###oh, i can, see it, too.###speakera237.###speakerb238.###speakera239.###those kids getting snatched *-1

52061:74	i, i guess 0 one of my favorite, well two of my favorite movies is probably like lethal weapon and lethal weapon two.	probably	###have you seen wild orchid?###speakerb11.###no,###is it good?###speakera12.###well, it depends,###do you like, uh, steamy movies.###speakerb13.###uh, no,###not ye-,###i know 0 that sounds funny *-1 coming from a woman,###but usually i don't.###speakera14.###oh, okay,###what type of movies do you like *t*-1?###speakerb15.###um, action.###speakera16.###bu-, d-,###speakerb17.
52109:40	i, i have *-1 to say that probably the one movie that *t*-2 really threw me back the most, uh, that i was really the most in shock with *t*-3 was probably, uh, star wars.	probably	###speakera26.###speakerb27.###um, that was okay,### i, i don't, i guess 0 i thought 0 it was too far fetched###but so many people said oh, no it wasn't *, you know.###but i guess,###speakera28.###oh, well i hope 0 i don't run across them.###speakerb29.###really,###that's true because,###i don't know,###i just didn't find that one to be real,### i, i just thought 0 it was too far fetched.###speakera30.###what *t*-1 was your favorite all time movie?###speakerb31.###um, oh gosh, i don-, i can't think off my head.###do you know which one yours was *t*-1?###speakera32.
52109:119	i, i have *-1 to say that probably the one movie that *t*-2 really threw me back the most, uh, that i was really the most in shock with *t*-3 was probably, uh, star wars.	probably	###speakera26.###speakerb27.###um, that was okay,### i, i don't, i guess 0 i thought 0 it was too far fetched###but so many people said oh, no it wasn't *, you know.###but i guess,###speakera28.###oh, well i hope 0 i don't run across them.###speakerb29.###really,###that's true because,###i don't know,###i just didn't find that one to be real,### i, i just thought 0 it was too far fetched.###speakera30.###what *t*-1 was your favorite all time movie?###speakerb31.###um, oh gosh, i don-, i can't think off my head.###do you know which one yours was *t*-1?###speakera32.
52145:11	that's probably something 0 i need *-1 to see *t*-2 right now because i'm taking history in school.	probably	###but that that's really like an all time classic.###i mean, i don't think 0 anybody, anything could ever beat that.###speakera38.###now, i, i also liked, uh, oh, gone with the wind or some of the classic, like the lawrence of arabia.###speakerb39.###see, i've never seen that.###speakera40.###oh, you haven't *?###speakerb41.###no,###should i rent it?###speakera42.###oh, yeah.###speakerb43.###should i go *-1 rent it tomorrow.###speakera44.###no,### that's, uh, that's a, that's a real interesting movie###and it's got a good historical perspective to it.###speakerb45.
52149:13	so it'd probably be a good thing 0 for me to see *t*-1.	probably	###speakerb39.###see, i've never seen that.###speakera40.###oh, you haven't *?###speakerb41.###no,###should i rent it?###speakera42.###oh, yeah.###speakerb43.###should i go *-1 rent it tomorrow.###speakera44.###no,### that's, uh, that's a, that's a real interesting movie###and it's got a good historical perspective to it.###speakerb45.###that's probably something 0 i need *-1 to see *t*-2 right now because i'm taking history in school.###speakera46.###oh, yeah.###speakerb47.
52259:36	we, we actually rent, uh, probably a go-, good combination of movies with the exception of horror films.	probably	###but see i don't really like sylvester stallone.###speakera78.###yeah.###speakerb79.###i don't think 0 he's really a very good actor.###i know 0 that sounds awful because so many people think 0 he's so wonderful###but i just have never been a stallone fan.###speakera80.###yo, adrian.###speakerb81.###hey that's pretty good.###speakera82.###speakerb83.###no,###i guess like i say, i just have,###i don't know,###i just have never seen any interest in him,###but.###speakera84.###no,
52314:16	you know students might try *-1 to do it.	might	###i just saw, uh, uh, a really interesting movie called *, uh, flatliners.###speakerb97.###oh, that was one of my favorites,###yes.###speakera98.###speakerb99.###i thought 0 that was a very good movie.###speakera100.###yeah.###speakerb101.###i was really impressed with that one.###i mean it was, what i liked *t*-1 about it was that it was a new subject.###nobody had ever touched it before.###speakera102.###yeah.###speakerb103.###you know, and it was just, it was done *-1 so well, you know,###it was just,###speakera104.###it was just crazy enough for th-,
52318:14	well that's probably true.	probably	###speakera98.###speakerb99.###i thought 0 that was a very good movie.###speakera100.###yeah.###speakerb101.###i was really impressed with that one.###i mean it was, what i liked *t*-1 about it was that it was a new subject.###nobody had ever touched it before.###speakera102.###yeah.###speakerb103.###you know, and it was just, it was done *-1 so well, you know,###it was just,###speakera104.###it was just crazy enough for th-,###you know students might try *-1 to do it.###you know, i mean, and it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it.###speakerb105.###right,
52420:11	that's probably true,	probably	###i enjoyed that.###speakerb133.###yeah,###it was *.###twins was good too,###because when i thought of that *t*-1, i thought of,###anyway.###um, oh, there was another one,###what *t*-2's the one that *t*-1 just,###oh, dances with wolves, have you seen that yet?###speakera134.###no,###i haven't *.###speakerb135.###oh, you've got *-1 to see that one,###it's really,###speakera136.###i hear 0 that's the one that you really need *-1 to see *t*-2 at the theater instead of home video.###speakerb137.###right,
52421:11	that's probably true.	probably	###speakerb133.###yeah,###it was *.###twins was good too,###because when i thought of that *t*-1, i thought of,###anyway.###um, oh, there was another one,###what *t*-2's the one that *t*-1 just,###oh, dances with wolves, have you seen that yet?###speakera134.###no,###i haven't *.###speakerb135.###oh, you've got *-1 to see that one,###it's really,###speakera136.###i hear 0 that's the one that you really need *-1 to see *t*-2 at the theater instead of home video.###speakerb137.###right,###that's probably true,
52462:13	that one is definitely worth * seeing,	definitely	###speakerb145.###oh, neat.###speakera146.###so, uh, uh, but anyhow we got, uh, we got a nice, uh, picture###and it came in an envelope that *t*-1 says dances with wolves###so we've got *-1 to, uh, try *-2 to get out there and see that one.###speakerb147.###oh, yeah,###it's really worth it.###i mean it's a very good movie###and yes, i would suggest * seeing it at the theater.###i know that they're still playing it###and they pushed it back, to *-1 playing it in the theaters until like august,###speakera148.###huh.###speakerb149.###i, think because they were, they were scheduling a video release of it in july###and then when it won all those awards *t*-1, uh, they pushed it back to august,###so.###but, yeah,
52595:8	we definitely have lost the judeo-christian ethic of the judicial system for sure,	definitely	###right then it was, it was, uh, almost immediate.###speakera37.###uh-huh.###speakerb38.###as soon as, as the trial was over, then it was stoning.###speakera39.###right,###but, in, in the old testament,###speakerb40.###we don't have a speedy trial,###we don't have speedy, um, punishment###and so it kind of loses its meaning, if you sit on death row for months and years and so forth.###speakera41.###uh-huh,###yeah.###speakerb42.###speakera43.###right,###we don't,###well, yeah
52629:11	there would probably be very few exceptions to that	probably	###but we're still, you know, we're still accountable to it.###we don't need *-1 to back talk,###but, you know, it's like god changes your heart * to not do that.###he changes your heart * not to look upon a woman in lust.###because in the old testament, they could look all 0 they wanted *t*-1, just couldn't do it.###but in the new, he's looking at your heart###and so, i guess 0 that's what, what i mean *t*-1 by their character changes###and, you know, what i mean *t*-2, it's like * looking beyond what they're doing *t*-3 and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart *t*-1, what's the character showing me *t*-4 here.### and, those, and then any of,### if i don't think see, if i don't believe that there's not a character change and the authorities agree, that this person needs *-1 to be excused *-2, i believe 0 for murder, uh, rape, i even believe *ich*-3 incest, things, that *t*-4 will permanently damage, uh, the character of the child.###speakerb48.###uh-huh.###speakera49.###i believe 0 crimes against children *ich*-2 should be punished *-1 bu-, by, by death. i believe, sexual crimes, unless there's a true change of character.###speakerb50.###i tend *-1 to agree on that, very strongly.###speakera51.###and that's where we just have *-1 to, to trust the authorities *t*-2.###and they're not going *-1 to excuse people, if it was, was run *-2 like that,###i don't,
52723:18	i feel like that might be better, if it was run *-1 on a more scriptural basis, which *t*-2 would include, you know, you know, and * expediting the penalties and just getting it over with.	might	###and, you'd see the same kid who *t*-1 were back out there in two days.###speakerb78.###that's sad.###speakera79.###because, there's no, the answer is not being given *-1 to them, in the court system###and i think 0 initially, when our country was set *-1 up *t*-2, it was set *-3 up with god###and it was really an integral part,###and no,### you can't, you can't force people,###but i think 0 people are hurting###and they're out *-1 doing crack *-2 sitting on the street.###they were the kind of people that, i think mostly, we would want *t*-1 to receive it. if it *ich*-3 was presented *-1 0 * to see *t*-2.###i don't know,###i guess, 0 i'm kind of frustrated that, you know, we've gotten away from the christian basis that our court system was founded *-1 upon *t*-2.###i mean, it reeks of the bible, just, the whole thing, the whole system.###and, so i feel like if that was presented *-1 more openly, and not just * relying upon, and para-church ministry *-2 to come in and do it, that, that the system itself,### you know, you know what i mean *t*-1.###speakerb80.###yeah.###speakera81.
52766:30	uh, we try *-1 to go once, maybe twice a summer. uh, we, uh, just, you know, for like a short weekend or something.	maybe	###yeah,###i know,###you're right,###they would lobby that### and, and i see that,###and that's why, you know, i'm like, okay, what's my role in this thing *t*-1,, you know, what's my part *t*-2 *t*-3,###speakerb96.###yeah.###speakera97.###because i don't think 0 the system is going *-1 to get fixed *-2.###i think 0 it's crippled...###speakera1.###okay.###do you go *-1 camping very much?###speakerb2.###no,###i've haven't gone *-1 camping in years.###but it's is something that i've done *t*-1 in the past.###how about you?###speakera3.
53385:73	oh, um, uh, i usually don't get *-1 to hea-, hear any of the current events probably until about the ten o'clock news.	probably	###speakera243.### you, me too.###speakerb244.###you have a good time *-1 camping,###when you go next time *t*-1, * think of me.###speakera245.###thanks.###speakerb246.###speakera247.###okay.###* thank you.###speakerb248.###all right.###speakera249.###bye-bye.###speakerb250.###bye-bye.###speakera1.###* go ahead.###speakerb2.
53507:15	i mean, probably * would have paid the same amount	probably	### but, uh, you know, but we need good schools.###uh, we're more involved in that now.###and, i, i, i, i think 0 it's better for everybody if we had better schools.###speakera45.###yeah,###that's true.###speakerb46.###so,###speakera47.###i would think 0 they could find a better way 0 * to fund it *t*-1 though,###but they haven't for,###speakerb48.###no.###you know, i wish 0 they could have gotten a lottery.###speakera49.###well, they're struggling with it.###speakerb50.###yeah.###i think 0, you know, the lottery could have helped, with that.###i mean, it wouldn't have been as painful as what we would've paid *t*-1 in state income tax.
53547:24	i mean, because that would definitely look like another korea,	definitely	###speakerb58.###yes,### that's, that's sad.###speakera59.###speakerb60.###yeah.### they, uh, yeah, they had *-1 to choose between the better of the two, two bad situations,###and, uh, i don't know what i've would have done *t*-1 in the situation.###speakera61.###uh-huh.###speakerb62.###speakera63.###yeah,###it begins *-1 to make you wonder why we didn't go ahead and go on in and, finish the job while we were in there *t*-2.###speakerb64.###yeah.###speakera65.###speakerb66.###right.###but i understand why bush, you know, doesn't want *-1 to go in and, and uh, take sides *t*-2.
53738:34	i mean, that's, that might be the only thing.	might	###each individual child.###speakerb12.###some kids are going *-1 to be great with mechanical stuff.###other kids are going *-1 to be really into math,###some are really going *-1 to be heavy into reading.###speakera13.###right.###speakerb14.###instead of * pushing the scales too far either direction, i mean it *exp*-1's great * to be well rounded and hav-, be exposed *-2 to all this stuff.###speakera15.###yeah.###that's,###speakerb16.###but why * not hit the points 0 the kid's really interested in *t*-1 *t*-2?###because if he's interested, he's going *-1 to study it,###and he's going *-1 to learn it,###and he's going *-1 to remember it.###speakera17.###that's true.### the only, i think 0 the only thing that they would argue *t*-1 about that, is that, you know, every child needs *-2 to learn every subject.
53739:37	but, i mean, i, i definitely agree with you.	definitely	###speakerb12.###some kids are going *-1 to be great with mechanical stuff.###other kids are going *-1 to be really into math,###some are really going *-1 to be heavy into reading.###speakera13.###right.###speakerb14.###instead of * pushing the scales too far either direction, i mean it *exp*-1's great * to be well rounded and hav-, be exposed *-2 to all this stuff.###speakera15.###yeah.###that's,###speakerb16.###but why * not hit the points 0 the kid's really interested in *t*-1 *t*-2?###because if he's interested, he's going *-1 to study it,###and he's going *-1 to learn it,###and he's going *-1 to remember it.###speakera17.###that's true.### the only, i think 0 the only thing that they would argue *t*-1 about that, is that, you know, every child needs *-2 to learn every subject.###i mean, that's, that might be the only thing.
53755:8	i definitely agree.	definitely	###speakera17.###that's true.### the only, i think 0 the only thing that they would argue *t*-1 about that, is that, you know, every child needs *-2 to learn every subject.###i mean, that's, that might be the only thing.###but, i mean, i, i definitely agree with you.###uh,###speakerb18.###they need exposure to every subject.###they don't need *-1 to be masters of it,###speakera19.###right,###right.###that's true.###uh,###speakerb20.###everything 0 i learned *t*-1 about ancient rome ha-, has not helped me anywhere in, my adult life.###speakera21.###speakerb22.###speakera23.###yes,
53808:46	i saw something on the news, oh, i don't know, maybe two weeks ago.	maybe	###oh, yes.###definitely,###i agree.###yeah,###there's,###speakerb34.###you know, i mean, if they really wanted *-1 to get to the meat of the matter, i mean, there's, they make all these people out *-2 to be, oh,###they were great men,###and they're the father of the country and all this.###he had just as much dirt *ich*-1 on him as anybody else.###speakera35.###speakerb36.###if not more.###the man was not a saint.###speakera37.###yeah.###that's true,###yeah.###any way, this, this, um, school system thing,### i, i tell you,
53830:8	i definitely agree with parents.	definitely	###i don't know where you're from *t*-1,###but i'm from the dallas area.###and they were talking about the plano school system, that, they had one school that, uh, if the students did something wrong, i mean, whether it was behavioral or, uh, you know, they weren't learning properly or something. they took these students and put them basically in a closet. with no windows *t*-1.###they had, a, a table, or not a table, but a desk in this closet,###and they had *-1 to sit in there by themselves.###well, parents were getting really angry about this, because they said, why is my child being put *-1 in this closet *t*-2.###well, how is that helping my child, you know *t*-1.###and, uh, the, the thing, you know,###they said, well, we're giving them isolation time###and this helps them to think.###but a lot of kids,###i mean, if a child has, uh, claustrophobia, i mean, that's just going *-1 to terrify him, you know###and,###speakerb38.### if, if the isolation concept really works that good, why are our prisons overcrowded *t*-1?###speakera39.###uh, that's true.###that's true.###but, no,###i mean, they were, uh, i mean,
53838:50	i mean, either way. you know, i, i definitely had *-1 to disagree with that.	definitely	###they said, well, we're giving them isolation time###and this helps them to think.###but a lot of kids,###i mean, if a child has, uh, claustrophobia, i mean, that's just going *-1 to terrify him, you know###and,###speakerb38.### if, if the isolation concept really works that good, why are our prisons overcrowded *t*-1?###speakera39.###uh, that's true.###that's true.###but, no,###i mean, they were, uh, i mean,###i definitely agree with parents.###i think 0 that is a very wrong way 0 * to handle, uh, *-1 disciplining a child *t*-2.###* putting them in, i mean, they were, they were call-, they called them *ich*-1 their quiet rooms or their isolation rooms.###they didn't call them closets.###but they showed these rooms on, uh, you know, on the news###and, i mean, they looked like a closet *ich*-1 *ich*-2 to me. you know, with a desk in it, a real small.###but they said that one of the solutions 0 they came up with *t*-1 was *-2 to take the doors off of these isolation rooms.###i said, now what good does thi-, i mean, how is this helping *t*-1?
53899:15	so, they're definitely going *-1 to work towards *-2 being good, you know, rather than trying *-3 to act up and be bad, you know.	definitely	###speakera55.###yeah,###that's true.###speakerb56.###but you cut, you know,### the, the kid's having *-1 to give up his, quote, play time *-2 to pay his debt for what he did *t*-3 wrong.###speakera57.###well,###speakerb58.###but he's seeing something constructive come out of it.###speakera59.###um, i have *-1 to,###i think 0 one of the positive things, i mean, one of the things that *t*-1 can come out of, uh, is not just di-, discipline, okay?###but, okay,###for instance, one of the things 0 they do *t*-1 at, uh, my kids school, uh, they have what they call *t*-2, uh, * caught *-3 being good slips.###and when the kids are in halls and stuff *t*-1, and if they're being really good, i mean, just being excellent, they're not, you know, cutting up and so on. they're just standing in line, doing whatever they are supposed *-2 to *?* *t*-3, they get one of these * caught *-4 being good slips.###and then, when they collect them at the end of each week *t*-1, they get *-2 to go to this little, what they call *t*-3 their * caught *-4 being good store,###and then they get *-1 to spend these like money.###well, see, to me, that's positive reinforcement, is much better, much better than * trying *-1 to find ways 0 *-2 to discipline kids *t*-3, because they're going *-4 to be good and try and earn those things, you know, *-5 to get the positive part of it.###i mean, they'd ra-, much rather *ich*-2 go in the store and buy something than * be spanked *-1.
53909:22	, i mean, my kids definitely get spanked *-1 when they need they need *-2 to be spanked *-3 *t*-4.	definitely	###speakera59.###um, i have *-1 to,###i think 0 one of the positive things, i mean, one of the things that *t*-1 can come out of, uh, is not just di-, discipline, okay?###but, okay,###for instance, one of the things 0 they do *t*-1 at, uh, my kids school, uh, they have what they call *t*-2, uh, * caught *-3 being good slips.###and when the kids are in halls and stuff *t*-1, and if they're being really good, i mean, just being excellent, they're not, you know, cutting up and so on. they're just standing in line, doing whatever they are supposed *-2 to *?* *t*-3, they get one of these * caught *-4 being good slips.###and then, when they collect them at the end of each week *t*-1, they get *-2 to go to this little, what they call *t*-3 their * caught *-4 being good store,###and then they get *-1 to spend these like money.###well, see, to me, that's positive reinforcement, is much better, much better than * trying *-1 to find ways 0 *-2 to discipline kids *t*-3, because they're going *-4 to be good and try and earn those things, you know, *-5 to get the positive part of it.###i mean, they'd ra-, much rather *ich*-2 go in the store and buy something than * be spanked *-1.###so, they're definitely going *-1 to work towards *-2 being good, you know, rather than trying *-3 to act up and be bad, you know.###speakerb60.###i think 0 that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself.### we've been too long, there's been too much negative reinforcement.###how much, da-, like, the * caught *-1 being good slips.###how about, just the john q citizen out there on the street?###speakera61.###yeah,###well that's true.### i think, i think, 0 really though, i mean, that's one thing that
53979:18	it's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend.	maybe	###my spare time###speakerb8.###yeah.###speakera9.###i usually go *-1 do aerobics and read,###and that's, about it.###speakerb10.###yeah.###speakera11.###speakerb12.###yeah.###i understood that.### i'm, you know, i work full time###and i have two kids###so my spare time usually involves something with the kids.###speakera13.###yeah.###speakerb14.###you know, hobbies,### we, i, i can't really say that we have hobbies.
54139:27	but, but it's certainly something that *t*-1 has a lot of things 0 * to talk about *t*-2.	certainly	###well, * thank you.###speakera73.###okay.###i hope 0 you have a good rest of your weekend.###speakerb74.###thanks.###bye-bye.###speakera75.###okay.###bye-bye.###speakerb1.###well, this is a good subject, isn't it *?*?###speakera2.###yeah.###speakerb3.### it's, it's something that you can really talk about *t*-1.###speakera4.###yeah.###speakerb5.###um, i don't know what we're going *-1 to do *t*-2 about it,

55095:11	he's probably like a lot of quarterbacks, uh,	probably	###well, that, that says a lot for the, for his ability, though i think 0 *t*-1.###for staubach's, i mean.###speakera33.###well, yeah.###speakerb34.###speakera35.###you know, he was one of the few who *t*-1 come through in history that *t*-2 can really perform,###uh, we hope,###every team hopes 0 their current quarterback is going *-1 to pull them through.###in a way aikman has done some of that.###but, uh, the guy winds up *-1 getting hurt *-2 every other game.###speakerb36.###yeah,### i, i tell you,###it's difficult in that guy's position * coming into that because there, he was just so highly touted *-1 by the press and everybody expected so many big things, you know.###speakera37.###yeah,###they did.###they put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside.###uh, it *exp*-1's funny * watching them, them play,
55115:21	i think 0 they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year,	probably	###he's probably like a lot of quarterbacks, uh,###when the pressure is really on *t*-1 when it's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season *t*-2 is when the guys seem *-3 to really do their best *t*-4.###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###speakera39.###and i haven't quite figured that out,###if they figure 0 they have got it won *-1 or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters or, uh, if, uh, if something happens that that adrenalin starts *-2 flowing.###they say, hey, we got *-3 to do something now. and then start *-4 playing the game the way 0 the game should be played *-5 *t*-6 toward the last few minutes.###speakerb40.###yeah.###speakera41.###so, i don't know###i'm looking for a good year.###i guess 0 we're always looking for a good year.###speakerb42.###so, obviously though, do you think 0 they're going *-1 to do anything in the playoffs *-2 to make it to the super bowl this year###or who do you, who do you like *t*-1 to do that this year?###speakera43.###uh, no###i don't think 0 the cowboys have got a chance.
55117:11	they'll probably get everybody's hopes up and blow it toward the end.	probably	###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###speakera39.###and i haven't quite figured that out,###if they figure 0 they have got it won *-1 or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters or, uh, if, uh, if something happens that that adrenalin starts *-2 flowing.###they say, hey, we got *-3 to do something now. and then start *-4 playing the game the way 0 the game should be played *-5 *t*-6 toward the last few minutes.###speakerb40.###yeah.###speakera41.###so, i don't know###i'm looking for a good year.###i guess 0 we're always looking for a good year.###speakerb42.###so, obviously though, do you think 0 they're going *-1 to do anything in the playoffs *-2 to make it to the super bowl this year###or who do you, who do you like *t*-1 to do that this year?###speakera43.###uh, no###i don't think 0 the cowboys have got a chance.###i think 0 they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year,###and they'll get close to it.
55123:44	uh, i'm figuring either one either the eagles or possibly san francisco	possibly	###speakerb40.###yeah.###speakera41.###so, i don't know###i'm looking for a good year.###i guess 0 we're always looking for a good year.###speakerb42.###so, obviously though, do you think 0 they're going *-1 to do anything in the playoffs *-2 to make it to the super bowl this year###or who do you, who do you like *t*-1 to do that this year?###speakera43.###uh, no###i don't think 0 the cowboys have got a chance.###i think 0 they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year,###and they'll get close to it.###they'll probably get everybody's hopes up and blow it toward the end.###speakerb44.###so who's *t*-1 going *-2 to beat them?###who are they going *-1 to blow it to *t*-2?###speakera45.###uh, that's a good question.
55289:11	there's probably five or six, which *t*-1 would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs, that *t*-2 are in positions over some of these soviet states.	probably	###speakerb14.###i'm surprised 0 during this iraqi crisis we didn't have more incidents than they did.###these guys are top of the line.### when they, when they graduate from there *t*-1, they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world.###and they are very, very good at what they do *t*-1.###so until i see the entire, quote, old guard of the soviet military, of the soviet government completely roll over and disappear, *-1 preferably buried *-2, i still consider them a threat.###speakera15.###uh-huh.###speakerb16.###their military is different from ours, to where there are extremist gen-, generals that *t*-1 actually control tens and thousands of troops. that irregardless of what soviet policy is *t*-2, *t*-3 they're going *-4 to do what the general tells them *t*-5 *t*-6.###speakera17.###yeah.###i guess 0 that's what *t*-1 concerns me the most. is 0 they're, they're so unstable that somebody like that could make, uh, decisions that *t*-2 would jeopardize a lot of people.###speakerb18.###well, it *exp*-1's in-, interesting * watching the different soviet states, albania, lithuania, doing their little revolts down there.###speakera19.###uh-huh.###speakerb20.###each one of those sectors has got a soviet general over the troops that *t*-1 are there.###so far they haven't run into the real psychos yet.
55317:74	if the bombs don't get you, if the bullets don't get you, then, then the nerve gas definitely will get you.	definitely	###and they, would level entire areas.###okay,###you're from the dallas area, right?###speakera23.###uh-huh.###speakerb24.###okay,###you know, basically the size of, uh, the area around richardson?###speakera25.###yeah.###speakerb26.###you put five soviet hyundee helicopters in the air, they can level the entire area###and there won't be anything left * alive.###and they can do that in about four minutes.###speakera27.###huh.###speakerb28.###and they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by.###they used them in afghanistan, did re-, remarkably well considering the terrain 0 they were flying in *t*-1.###but on a highly populated area, like some of the soviet cities would be *?*, with the weaponry that *t*-1's attached *-2 on those things, there is no place 0 * to hide *t*-3.
55342:4	definitely.	definitely	###speakerb30.###were you,###have you,###i take it 0 you haven't spent any time in the military?###speakera31.###no,###i haven't *?*.###speakerb32.###as a civilian that *t*-1's never been attached *-2 to any form of the military, i know 0 a lot of this stuff that i was involved in *t*-1, never did make the newspapers.###speakera33.###uh-huh.###speakerb34.###but, during that same time frame, didn't you get some feeling, that, i mean, they're getting all these weapons and stuff?###didn't it *ich*-1 bug you a little bit why they kept *-2 coming up with all this stuff *t*-3?###speakera35.###you mean in the, in the most recent conflict?###speakerb36.###in any of them since eighty-one.###speakera37.###oh. yeah,
55445:13	but it's definitely a task.	definitely	###i have, uh, a stationary bike and, uh, a regular bike.###and when i can *?* *t*-1, i like *-2 to ride my regular bike outside, because it's so much nicer.###the stationary bike is, is so, uh, boring.###speakerb2.###boring.###speakera3.###but i have head phones,### and i, plus i have it, uh, in the living room###so i either watch t v##, or we have a fish tank,###speakerb4.###speakera5.###so i watch the fish, you know.###whatever i can do *t*-1 *-2 to keep myself occupied.### if, i like *-1 to have the t v on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied.###it kind of takes the time away###and i don't realize,### really, that's really the only time 0 i ever watch t v *t*-1, is when i'm on the bike *t*-2.### but, and then usually after i'm done *-1 riding the bike, just * to cool myself down, i usually take a walk, you know,###and that just kind of gets myself, uh, gets me, you know, to where i'm not quite as tired *t*-1 i guess 0 *t*-2.
55667:32	i guess then 0 the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you, wouldn't it *?*?	probably	### i have a, i have a bad back,###speakera89.###speakerb90.###so i'm very limited what i do *t*-1.###speakera91.###oh, okay.###speakerb92.###it's like i can walk,###but if i walk for more than fifteen minutes it's going *-1 to bother me.###speakera93.###um.###speakerb94.###especially when you're on cement or anything that *t*-1's hard *t*-2,###it will bother me.###speakera95.###then that would,###yeah.###speakerb96.###it will bother me.###speakera97.
55765:28	i think 0 i have gone home maybe once or twice *-1 slightly sore.	maybe	###so it's kind of nice.###speakera125.###wow.###that's,###speakerb126.###like i said, i like it.###i like the heat.###i like the,###i jump out of the swimming pool,###and i go into the hot tub.###speakera127.###oh.###speakerb128.###and i love it.###speakera129.###yeah.###that would be really nice.###speakerb130.###because i have n-, i have never,###* let me reword that,
55797:18	i'm considering *-1 maybe even buying one of those too.	maybe	###speakera135.###so you really do enjoy your exercise then, since your,###speakerb136.###it's fun.###it's fun.###uh, i've gotten on the bike.###and they've got, uh, the stepping bike, where you step *t*-1.###speakera137.###uh-huh.###speakerb138.###and i've enjoyed that, *-1 watching how well i can walk up and down stairs *t*-2.###speakera139.###that's, you know,### i wanted, i wanted *-1 to get one of those steppers when i bought the bike *t*-2,###speakerb140.###but most of the others to me are very dull.###speakera141.###but i got talked *-1 into the bike instead.###and i don't know,###i really wanted a stepper.

56847:60	maybe not in a, in a deep philosophical sense, but in a selfish sense, it probably would *?*.	probably	###yeah.###speakerb20.###i wish 0 we were given *-1 an opportunity * to vote on more things.###speakera21.###i do t-,###speakerb22.###i think 0 our elected officials say 0 they are speaking for us###but they're not speaking for me.###speakera23.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###yeah,###i wouldn't mind *-1 having, oh, more votes than i get *-2 to have *?*, frankly.###speakerb24.###that's true.###speakera25.###anyone who *t*-1 doesn't vote, it's fine with me as long as i can have their vote.###speakerb26.###speakera27.###that would make me happy though.
56934:7	and certainly that's true in the overall,	certainly	###i have people here that i know *t*-1 that *t*-2 have never registered *-3 to vote.###speakera49.###uh-huh.###speakerb50.###and i think, i think 0 they feel 0 they can criticize if they don't.###speakera51.###yeah,###i was sort of, s-,###speakerb52.###i told them 0 if they don't vote they don't have the right * to criticize.###speakera53.###well i,###that's how i feel *t*-1.###i mean, if yo-, if you vote and your guy looses well you leas-, you least tried###and you can say something###but if you don't vote, i sort of feel like, part of me, and it's kind of a nasty part of me feels like, well if you didn't vote, you get what *t*-1's coming to you, you know.###speakerb54.###that's right,###i feel th-,###speakera55.
56937:184	when they especially when someone, they,, they don't vote for someone because they don't like any of them and then the person gets in and they don't like him and he turns out *-1 to have been worse than her that they might have voted for *t*-2, or something like that *t*-3.	might	###speakerb50.###and i think, i think 0 they feel 0 they can criticize if they don't.###speakera51.###yeah,###i was sort of, s-,###speakerb52.###i told them 0 if they don't vote they don't have the right * to criticize.###speakera53.###well i,###that's how i feel *t*-1.###i mean, if yo-, if you vote and your guy looses well you leas-, you least tried###and you can say something###but if you don't vote, i sort of feel like, part of me, and it's kind of a nasty part of me feels like, well if you didn't vote, you get what *t*-1's coming to you, you know.###speakerb54.###that's right,###i feel th-,###speakera55.###and certainly that's true in the overall,###i mean no one individual 0 that's true for *t*-1###but for the population as a whole, i sort of feel that way.
56996:15	well, uh, maybe they should *?*,	maybe	###i'm interested.###speakera69.###no,###i'm not *?*.###speakerb70.###not,###okay,###i just wondered.###speakera71.### and, uh, so i'm, i'm really quite, quite curious, how that would work *t*-1, * to have both, i mean, you know,###and i believe in the, in a certain, uh,###soviet bloc countries you are, are obliged *-1 to vote too.###in fact, it *exp*-2 was even pretty much spelled *-1 out who you did vote for *t*-3, up until fairly recently###and, that's what i think of *t*-1 when i think of 0 you're obliged *-2 to vote *t*-3.###but when you actually, really are given *-1 as much choice as you are *?* in this country, with its two party system *t*-2, um,###i don't know,###i kind of,###part of me is wary###and part of me likes the idea of * having it be more of a duty, um.###speakerb72.
57037:24	maybe it should, maybe it should be *?*.	maybe	###that's considered *-1 a privilege, not a right.###speakerb78.###that is a privilege,###right,###tha-,###speakera79.###yeah,###but technically people, most people,###technically it's a privilege,###but most people think of it as a right.###i mean, in other words if the government denies you driving, denies you a driver's license, people get very upset.###but actually it's a privilege, which *t*-1 is allowed *-2 to be revoked *-3.###speakerb80.###it is *?*.###speakera81.###speakerb82.###that's correct.###speakera83.###and, fortunately voting isn't that.###speakerb84.
57106:83	and, there's a notion that somehow, if someone isn't as much as a government person, they're less corrupt and they're more likely *-1 to be good which *t*-2 is really strange,	likely	###and cases like that, he argues, need *-1 to be constrained *-2,### and, and actually i agree, except that i don't trust the people who *t*-1 are appointed *-2 to vote.###speakerb104.###sometimes i think 0 we have that right now, with congress.###speakera105.###yeah,###well, i, i mean, i feel that, i feel that wa-,###speakerb106.###i think 0 they're looking after their own self preservation more than they're actually looking after the good of the country.###speakera107.###yeah,###well their job is * to be reelected *-1, by in large,###and, so they work on that job.###and there's also an antigovernment mood in the country, you know, where government is misspending your dollars *t*-1### and, and they're all fools,###and you know, * throw, throw the bastards out,###that kind of thing.###speakerb108.###right.###speakera109.
57415:15	i think 0 maybe it was nine ninety-nine or something.	maybe	###so that, that has a lot * to do with it.###speakera103.###right.###speakerb104.###but, um,###well,###speakera105.###like i bought, i bought the most beautiful swe-, uh, sweater from, uh, i believe 0 it was *rnr*-1 ross * dress for less.###speakerb106.###uh.###speakera107.###and it wa-, it was really pretty,### it was just, you know, it was just plain, a plain, uh, ro-, you know, round, uh, necked, uh, sw-, sweater.###speakerb108.###uh-huh.###speakera109.###and it had, like, it was embellished around the, the top, you know,###it had, uh, leather, leather designs and, um, some other, other little things on it###and i just thought 0 it was so pretty###and i go-, i got it at a real good price,
57464:62	i haven't gotten really involved in anything, uh, extensive in car repairs in, oh, oh, probably a year or so.	probably	###yeah,###um, they don't really buy the first quality,###they buy the second.###and, uh, places like j c penney's that they'll reject the seconds,###they'll send them back every time.###speakerb122.###uh-huh.###speakera123.###but places like ross * dress for less and, uh, t j max.###speakerb124.###t j max does that,###speakera125.###uh-huh.###speakerb126.###yeah###we have a t j max over here###and, um,###speakera1.###i don't know what the,###the last thing 0 i've done *t*-1 as far as car repairs go is, is * change oil and filter an, and that kind of stuff.
57559:49	i mean, though for what you could get *t*-1 for one, you might as well drive it over a cliff.	might	###the hardest part about, uh, water pump changes is * getting all the junk off, before you can get too it.###speakerb26.###well that's true.###you're right, you know,###by the time 0 you've finally got down to it *t*-1,###i was hoping 0 i could remember where all those other things went *t*-1.###speakera27.###well that's kind of the way 0 i was *t*-1,###i tried *-1 to remember *ich*-3 as i took stuff off where it went *t*-2,###and i don't think 0 i had too many nuts and bolts left * over when i got it all put *-1 back together *t*-2.###speakerb28.###a few years ago i had an oldsmobile diesel###and, uh, the,###uh, it,###after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump *ich*-1 went out on it.###and, uh, i bought it when we were living in lubbock *t*-1,###when i came back here *t*-1, i brought the car back here###and, uh, i don't know,###diesels got pretty unpopular###and you couldn't sell the thi-,
57568:13	and that was probably one of the most miserable things 0 i had gotten into *t*-1 in a long time.	probably	###and i don't think 0 i had too many nuts and bolts left * over when i got it all put *-1 back together *t*-2.###speakerb28.###a few years ago i had an oldsmobile diesel###and, uh, the,###uh, it,###after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump *ich*-1 went out on it.###and, uh, i bought it when we were living in lubbock *t*-1,###when i came back here *t*-1, i brought the car back here###and, uh, i don't know,###diesels got pretty unpopular###and you couldn't sell the thi-,###i mean, though for what you could get *t*-1 for one, you might as well drive it over a cliff.###speakera29.###oh, yeah.###yeah.###speakerb30.###and, uh, the injector pump went bad###so i found a outfit down here 0 *t*-1 to rebuild it. and, uh, i-, reinstalled that###speakera31.###speakerb32.
57615:22	i don't notice it, probably because i don-,	probably	###and the ones in, in the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible 0 * to do anything with *t*-1.###speakera43.###well i,###speakerb44.###i've had a lot of good service out of that car,###but, uh, uh, i finally gave it to my son###and he drove it literally into the ground, you know.###speakera45.###yeah.###speakerb46.###he was out at tech###and he, he finished it off.###speakera47.### i'm, i guess 0 you're right### the, the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status.###i don't know exactly why.###one of the reasons is### i, i'm beginning *-1 to wonder is, where do you get gas at *t*-2.###i su-,###i don't know if it's still, uh, limited like it was *?*,
57626:7	but maybe because i'm not looking for it.	maybe	###and he, he finished it off.###speakera47.### i'm, i guess 0 you're right### the, the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status.###i don't know exactly why.###one of the reasons is### i, i'm beginning *-1 to wonder is, where do you get gas at *t*-2.###i su-,###i don't know if it's still, uh, limited like it was *?*,###i don't notice it, probably because i don-,###speakerb48.###what,###the availability?###speakera49.###huh?###speakerb50.###you mean the diesel availability?###speakera51.###yeah,### i don't, i don't notice
57824:28	so i guess 0 i've done probably, uh, i'd say seven or eight of them.	probably	###it's kind of like the inside dual on a truck.###you know, when one of them breaks *t*-1, it's not the outside one,###speakera119.###oh man.###speakerb120.### it's, it's the, it's usually that power steering *ich*-2 be-, or something that *t*-1's way back in there.###speakera121.###you bet,###everything else's got *-1 to come off first.###speakerb122.###everything's got *-1 to come off.###speakera123.###well, it *exp*-1's a pleasure * meeting you.###speakerb124.###yeah,###and we'll, uh,###how many times have you done this now *t*-1?###is this,###speakera125.###uh, i've got, uh, five stickers *ich*-1 here from t i,
57844:5	maybe they're burnt out or,	maybe	###so i guess 0 i've done probably, uh, i'd say seven or eight of them.###speakerb126.###yeah,###i hadn't, uh, hadn't, not gotten any calls here in the last, uh,###this is the first one in a week or so.###speakera127.###yeah,###i haven't gotten any calls in two weeks,###so i don't know, if, if it's tapering off, or what.###speakerb128.###if ta-, it's winding down or what.###speakera129.###i had a difficult time *ich*-1 the past couple of times of *-2 getting, uh, answers.###speakerb130.###* finding a taker.###speakera131.###so it sounds,###it's taken them ten, fifteen minutes at a time,###so, people are either not,###no-,
57859:16	and so there's probably a lot of things 0 i remember *t*-1 and a lot of things that i really didn't have a clue as to what *t*-2 was happening *t*-3.	probably	###speakera131.###so it sounds,###it's taken them ten, fifteen minutes at a time,###so, people are either not,###no-,###maybe they're burnt out or,###yeah.###speakerb132.###yeah,###well.###speakera133.###anyway * let you go.###thanks for * talking.###speakerb134.###okay,###all right.###bye-bye.###speakera1.###uh, i have, uh, i guess 0 *t*-1 a lot of thoughts about the vietnam war, um,### i, i guess 0 i feel like i was pretty young while it was going on
57863:25	um, * looking back, like maybe some of the things that i know *t*-1 now, i, i'm not sure 0 i do believe 0 it was worth the cost in dollars and lives.	maybe	###no-,###maybe they're burnt out or,###yeah.###speakerb132.###yeah,###well.###speakera133.###anyway * let you go.###thanks for * talking.###speakerb134.###okay,###all right.###bye-bye.###speakera1.###uh, i have, uh, i guess 0 *t*-1 a lot of thoughts about the vietnam war, um,### i, i guess 0 i feel like i was pretty young while it was going on###and so there's probably a lot of things 0 i remember *t*-1 and a lot of things that i really didn't have a clue as to what *t*-2 was happening *t*-3.###speakerb2.###yeah.###speakera3.
57875:28	you know, i just feel like maybe we went in *-1 to be policeman	maybe	###bye-bye.###speakera1.###uh, i have, uh, i guess 0 *t*-1 a lot of thoughts about the vietnam war, um,### i, i guess 0 i feel like i was pretty young while it was going on###and so there's probably a lot of things 0 i remember *t*-1 and a lot of things that i really didn't have a clue as to what *t*-2 was happening *t*-3.###speakerb2.###yeah.###speakera3.###um, * looking back, like maybe some of the things that i know *t*-1 now, i, i'm not sure 0 i do believe 0 it was worth the cost in dollars and lives.###that was one of the questions that she asked us *-1 to think about *t*-2,### because i, because we never went to war.###i don't think 0 we were committed to * winning it and getting out###and i, i feel like it went on and on.###speakerb4.###right.###speakera5.###and i, i guess 0 i see such a contrast like as opposed to the middle east war 0 we just had *t*-1, where president bush went out and got worldwide support for, for what *t*-2 was happening *t*-3.###speakerb6.###right.###speakera7.
57890:19	don't you think that maybe that's why we had it this time *t*-1?	maybe	###speakera5.###and i, i guess 0 i see such a contrast like as opposed to the middle east war 0 we just had *t*-1, where president bush went out and got worldwide support for, for what *t*-2 was happening *t*-3.###speakerb6.###right.###speakera7.###you know, i just feel like maybe we went in *-1 to be policeman###and i'm not sure 0 that's our role,###but.###speakerb8.###yeah,### i, i agree with that,### i was, i was fairly young at the time too,### i, i really don't have very many memories about it at all, in fact.###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###and, uh, my husband is a vietnam veteran###and i-, you know, he in * looking at the persian gulf war that *t*-1 just went on, he,### i-, it frustrates him because of the support that they have *t*-1 and the support that the vietnam vets did not have *t*-2, from the people or the administration, either one.###speakera11.
57892:17	but i feel like maybe the american people and, and the government are aware of the things that we did *t*-1 wrong that we didn't support that, that those,	maybe	###speakerb6.###right.###speakera7.###you know, i just feel like maybe we went in *-1 to be policeman###and i'm not sure 0 that's our role,###but.###speakerb8.###yeah,### i, i agree with that,### i was, i was fairly young at the time too,### i, i really don't have very many memories about it at all, in fact.###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###and, uh, my husband is a vietnam veteran###and i-, you know, he in * looking at the persian gulf war that *t*-1 just went on, he,### i-, it frustrates him because of the support that they have *t*-1 and the support that the vietnam vets did not have *t*-2, from the people or the administration, either one.###speakera11.###don't you think that maybe that's why we had it this time *t*-1?###i mean i do think that, i-, i-, it's been too long in * coming
57957:58	uh, you know whether it was justified or not, i know, that *t*-1 they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakera27.###and then he has backed out,###he has pulled out.###and i realize 0 they're still saying, well here you're encouraging us to get rid *-1 of saddam hussein,###so why aren't you helping us *t*-1?###and you see, i think 0 him going in and doing that would be putting us in another vietnam situation.###speakerb28.###i think 0 it would *?* too.###speakera29.###and i don't think 0 the u s will stand for it.###i don't think 0 he would do that,###speakerb30.###no,###speakera31.###uh, i think 0 we learned too much of the effects.###speakerb32.###yeah,###i agree with that.###speakera33.
57958:30	i, i feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing *-2 to try and help *-1 maintain the democracy over there and, and beat the communism,	maybe	###speakera27.###and then he has backed out,###he has pulled out.###and i realize 0 they're still saying, well here you're encouraging us to get rid *-1 of saddam hussein,###so why aren't you helping us *t*-1?###and you see, i think 0 him going in and doing that would be putting us in another vietnam situation.###speakerb28.###i think 0 it would *?* too.###speakera29.###and i don't think 0 the u s will stand for it.###i don't think 0 he would do that,###speakerb30.###no,###speakera31.###uh, i think 0 we learned too much of the effects.###speakerb32.###yeah,###i agree with that.###speakera33.###uh, you know whether it was justified or not, i know, that *t*-1 they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause.
58006:15	i think that maybe a lot of the arab countries that *t*-1 were so hateful towards the united states have come away with, uh, kind of a different attitude.	maybe	###i know.###speakerb46.### and, and tha-, that's what *t*-1 frustrates me more than anything.###speakera47.###and i, i believe that we have *-1 to have a military###and i believe that we have *-1 to have a defense *-2 to keep anybody else from *-3 walking in and doing it to us.###speakerb48.###right.###speakera49.###but i also believe that we need *-1 to turn so much of that inward.###speakerb50.###i think 0 there's a lot of waste### and, and they don't,### i-, if they could just cut out all the fat and, and get it lean, and start *-1 addressing some of the other issues, i think 0 *t*-2 we could take care of everything. and quit *-3 taking care of all these other countries all across the world, you know, who *t*-4 just end up *-5 using things against us later on anyway.###speakera51.###ye-,###speakerb52.###speakera53.###i know,###i do think that in the middle east war, um,
58010:20	uh, i think that maybe we're not their big bad enemy any more.	maybe	###and i, i believe that we have *-1 to have a military###and i believe that we have *-1 to have a defense *-2 to keep anybody else from *-3 walking in and doing it to us.###speakerb48.###right.###speakera49.###but i also believe that we need *-1 to turn so much of that inward.###speakerb50.###i think 0 there's a lot of waste### and, and they don't,### i-, if they could just cut out all the fat and, and get it lean, and start *-1 addressing some of the other issues, i think 0 *t*-2 we could take care of everything. and quit *-3 taking care of all these other countries all across the world, you know, who *t*-4 just end up *-5 using things against us later on anyway.###speakera51.###ye-,###speakerb52.###speakera53.###i know,###i do think that in the middle east war, um,###i think that maybe a lot of the arab countries that *t*-1 were so hateful towards the united states have come away with, uh, kind of a different attitude.###speakerb54.###uh-huh.###speakera55.
58278:23	except i think, that they probably just said well, we're just going *-1 to start *-2 using the things now	probably	###it *exp*-1's hard * to take it seriously.###speakerb24.###oh, yeah.###speakera25.###and as long as both were given *-1, you, basically, just don't read the kilometers per hour,###you just say, well look * read the miles per hour one,###the other one must be for someone else.###speakerb26.###that's right.###speakera27.###uh, i don't know,###i mean even britain has converted over###and we inherited this mess from them###and, uh,###speakerb28.###that's right,###it's all their fault.###speakera29.###well, i mean, it's more *ich*-1 our fault than theirs at this point because they, they saw the light, um,###i don't know why they we-, um, were more able than we were *?* *t*-1
58281:74	of course, * being part of the european community, if everybody else did it they, they were probably much more,	probably	###speakera25.###and as long as both were given *-1, you, basically, just don't read the kilometers per hour,###you just say, well look * read the miles per hour one,###the other one must be for someone else.###speakerb26.###that's right.###speakera27.###uh, i don't know,###i mean even britain has converted over###and we inherited this mess from them###and, uh,###speakerb28.###that's right,###it's all their fault.###speakera29.###well, i mean, it's more *ich*-1 our fault than theirs at this point because they, they saw the light, um,###i don't know why they we-, um, were more able than we were *?* *t*-1###except i think, that they probably just said well, we're just going *-1 to start *-2 using the things now###and you sort of have *-1 to force people to change since they don't want *-2 to.###speakerb30.
58285:30	that's, that's probably true	probably	###speakerb26.###that's right.###speakera27.###uh, i don't know,###i mean even britain has converted over###and we inherited this mess from them###and, uh,###speakerb28.###that's right,###it's all their fault.###speakera29.###well, i mean, it's more *ich*-1 our fault than theirs at this point because they, they saw the light, um,###i don't know why they we-, um, were more able than we were *?* *t*-1###except i think, that they probably just said well, we're just going *-1 to start *-2 using the things now###and you sort of have *-1 to force people to change since they don't want *-2 to.###speakerb30.###of course, * being part of the european community, if everybody else did it they, they were probably much more,###* is much more necessary for them than for us.###speakera31.###that's true,
58316:59	but human nature being such as it is *?*, i would think 0 it would take, probably, two or three years before people co-, could completely cut the cord.	probably	###* remember me getting a package of something that *t*-1 said one pound,###this is a package of dates mind you,### it's, was, presumably something 0 you weigh *t*-1 fairly precisely,###it said one pound###and then in parenthesis it said four hundred fifty-four point six grams.###speakerb34.###right,###right.###speakera35.###and, as near as i could tell, * seeing that was basically anti-metric propaganda###cause anyone who *t*-1 would say, well look i can either buy a pound of something at four hundred sixty-four point six grams which, of course, they couldn't weigh *t*-2 it out accurately anyway, um,###every time 0 i see something like that *t*-1 i think, well, that's, that's an anti-metric argument.###speakerb36.###yeah.###well, uh, i, i don't think 0 it'll, it could ever happen with, with a quick transition.###speakera37.###you don't?###speakerb38.###no.### i, i think 0 that would be the easiest way
58439:25	so we, we definitely have different tastes,	definitely	###when i was single *t*-2 we used *-1 to always cook, around the house.###speakera6.###yeah,### do, do you like *-1 to cook.###speakerb7.###huh, yeah,###i really like it,###speakera8.###yeah,###yeah.###speakerb9.###um, there's a few dishes,###like, i, i grew up with the, um, you know, * having polish and ukrainian food.###speakera10.###oh, really.###speakerb11.###and my wife, she likes italian and stuff,###speakera12.###oh.###speakerb13.
58929:11	you probably could *?*,	probably	###speakerb163.###yeah,### one of my, one of my friends here, he was just talking how he's thinking of *-1 leaving the company and going to dallas *t*-2,###* saying how,###speakera164.###oh, yeah,###no kidding.###well, things are doing pretty good down here,### we, we were, we tried *-1 to move over to raleigh last year###and there just was, there was so little, such little going on in raleigh, you know,###you couldn't get a job *-1 to save yourself over there###so we decided 0 we'll try in a couple of years,### but, but business is,###speakerb165.###yeah,###yeah.###we were saying 0 we could sell our house here and buy one down there###cash, you know.###speakera166.###yeah,
58930:8	you probably could *?*,	probably	###yeah,### one of my, one of my friends here, he was just talking how he's thinking of *-1 leaving the company and going to dallas *t*-2,###* saying how,###speakera164.###oh, yeah,###no kidding.###well, things are doing pretty good down here,### we, we were, we tried *-1 to move over to raleigh last year###and there just was, there was so little, such little going on in raleigh, you know,###you couldn't get a job *-1 to save yourself over there###so we decided 0 we'll try in a couple of years,### but, but business is,###speakerb165.###yeah,###yeah.###we were saying 0 we could sell our house here and buy one down there###cash, you know.###speakera166.###yeah,### you probably could *?*,
58949:23	well, uh, the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so.	definitely	### you probably could *?*,###you probably could *?*,###speakerb167.###well northern virginia.###okay.###speakera168.###okay,###well it *exp*-1's good * talking to you.###speakerb169.###nice * talking to you too.###speakera170.###* take care.###speakerb171.###bye, bye,###speakera172.###bye.###speakera1.###okay,###what do you think *t*-1 about it?###speakerb2.
59082:23	and, if i'd of probably had three or four children, i don't see how *t*-2 we could have made it, you know, without me working *t*-1.	probably	###and the books are outrageous. i mean, absolutely outrageous,###speakerb44.###oh, i know,###i know.###speakera45.###and they're getting worse.###uh, my daughter brought home a book *ich*-4 the other day that she was going *-1 to have *-2 to have *t*-3 for her, one of her next classes###and it was like ninety-six dollars.###speakerb46.###gee.###speakera47.###and this book is a little bitty skinny book.###speakerb48.###yeah.###speakera49.###i said my goodness, what is it, lined *-1 in gold, you know, uh.###speakerb50.###yeah.###speakera51.###but it is, it's getting worse,
59084:32	but that's, that's probably because, you know, if you had three, you, you know, would say, if i'd of had four.	probably	###oh, i know,###i know.###speakera45.###and they're getting worse.###uh, my daughter brought home a book *ich*-4 the other day that she was going *-1 to have *-2 to have *t*-3 for her, one of her next classes###and it was like ninety-six dollars.###speakerb46.###gee.###speakera47.###and this book is a little bitty skinny book.###speakerb48.###yeah.###speakera49.###i said my goodness, what is it, lined *-1 in gold, you know, uh.###speakerb50.###yeah.###speakera51.###but it is, it's getting worse,###and, if i'd of probably had three or four children, i don't see how *t*-2 we could have made it, you know, without me working *t*-1.###speakerb52.
59086:16	but in essence you probably would have worked out fine.	probably	###speakera45.###and they're getting worse.###uh, my daughter brought home a book *ich*-4 the other day that she was going *-1 to have *-2 to have *t*-3 for her, one of her next classes###and it was like ninety-six dollars.###speakerb46.###gee.###speakera47.###and this book is a little bitty skinny book.###speakerb48.###yeah.###speakera49.###i said my goodness, what is it, lined *-1 in gold, you know, uh.###speakerb50.###yeah.###speakera51.###but it is, it's getting worse,###and, if i'd of probably had three or four children, i don't see how *t*-2 we could have made it, you know, without me working *t*-1.###speakerb52.###but that's, that's probably because, you know, if you had three, you, you know, would say, if i'd of had four.###i guess 0 it's always * not, not being able *-1 to picture one more,
59202:11	they're probably going, oh, i bet 0 she can't get pregnant	probably	###here, it's your turn, you know.###speakera85.###yeah,###but, you know, that, now even###whenever i was coming up and everything *t*-1###and we got married *-1 right out of high school,###well a year after i got out of high school,###speakerb86.###uh-huh.###speakera87.###and, uh, i didn't have kids for four and a half years###but that was because i wanted *-1 to work###and i wasn't ready for kids.###speakerb88.###yeah,###i think 0 that's what it is *t*-1,###i'm not *?* either.###speakera89.###and, everybody thought, oh, my gosh, what *t*-1 is the matter with her, you know.###speakerb90.
59228:32	now, she says that, you know, maybe when she's thirty *t*-1 she might want a child then.	maybe	###speakerb92.###yeah.###speakera93.###well you don't just get ready.###but i was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that *t*-1 married during my time, they had kids within a year.###speakerb94.###yeah.###speakera95.###and i just was not ready for kids.###i wanted *-1 to get out and work a little bit###and i wanted *-1 to travel and stuff like that, which we did *t*-2.###and, uh, kids didn't fit in right then,###but, it's getting more and more like that where there's more and more couples *t*-1###and, really, if you don't want the kids, then it's not the time 0 * to have,###i don't care what anybody tells you *t*-1.###speakerb96.###right.###speakera97.###and i think that more and more the attitude's getting that a way.###because that's like my daughter
59228:55	now, she says that, you know, maybe when she's thirty *t*-1 she might want a child then.	might	###speakerb92.###yeah.###speakera93.###well you don't just get ready.###but i was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that *t*-1 married during my time, they had kids within a year.###speakerb94.###yeah.###speakera95.###and i just was not ready for kids.###i wanted *-1 to get out and work a little bit###and i wanted *-1 to travel and stuff like that, which we did *t*-2.###and, uh, kids didn't fit in right then,###but, it's getting more and more like that where there's more and more couples *t*-1###and, really, if you don't want the kids, then it's not the time 0 * to have,###i don't care what anybody tells you *t*-1.###speakerb96.###right.###speakera97.###and i think that more and more the attitude's getting that a way.###because that's like my daughter
59338:67	um, i guess 0 on a one, a scale of one of ten i'm probably around a two in terms of fair * restricting guns	probably	###speakerb128.###right.###speakera129.###so, uh, more and more of our hospitals, especially, over here are getting them###and then some of the bigger companies,###but it's mainly the hospitals.###speakerb130.###yeah,###i don't know if the t i in dallas does or not.### i know, i know 0 nobody around here does, it,### we're, it's too small around here.###speakera131.###oh really.###speakerb132.###yeah.###speakera1.###well, um, i'm, uh, pretty pro gun control over all.### i, uh, i've had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control###and, uh, i must say that there are a couple of arguments against, uh, strong gun control which i find *t*-1 very compelling, although most the people who *t*-2 argue gun control with me i find, uh, 0 *t*-3 use sort of canned arguments, you know, sort of the n r a slogan arguments###and, um, uh, see i've been very frustrated when i do debate with people about it *t*-1.
59365:70	and on top of that *-1 spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military, as a green beret, i definitely respect the power of weaponry.	definitely	###uh-huh.###speakerb4.###i hope 0 you're ready for this.###speakera5.###um, uh, i'll give it a try.###i've got my texan stereotypes in place.###speakerb6.###well, i'm not your stereotypical texan.###i was raised *-1 around guns, hunting.###speakera7.###uh-huh.###speakerb8.###so i don't have a fear of fire arms in any respect.###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.### i resp-, i respect them and what their capabilities are *t*-1.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.
59469:18	i mean, i certainly feel that if, if, we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm *t*-1	certainly	###speakera39.###speakerb40.###speakera41.###uh-huh.###speakerb42.###speakera43.###yeah.###speakerb44.###i'd said about an eight.###speakera45.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###well, we can could be,###speakerb46.###i said 0 the restrictions 0 i would like *-1 to see *t*-2 on, for anybody, whether it being for handgun, a rifle, a shotgun,###i would like *-1 to see them go through either,###i'd like *-1 to see a law enforcement agency, not n r a,###but whether it be the, your state police or your county police for you to be able purchase a handgun. you got *-1 to go through their course and get certified *-2 that you know how * to properly handle the weapon *t*-1, how * to safely handle the weapon *t*-3, how * to properly maintain it *t*-4, the three basics.###speakera47.###well, that makes a lot of since to me.
59470:17	but, uh, i certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility * to know how * do, use it safely *t*-2 as someone learns how * to drive *t*-1, if not more so.	certainly	###speakerb40.###speakera41.###uh-huh.###speakerb42.###speakera43.###yeah.###speakerb44.###i'd said about an eight.###speakera45.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###well, we can could be,###speakerb46.###i said 0 the restrictions 0 i would like *-1 to see *t*-2 on, for anybody, whether it being for handgun, a rifle, a shotgun,###i would like *-1 to see them go through either,###i'd like *-1 to see a law enforcement agency, not n r a,###but whether it be the, your state police or your county police for you to be able purchase a handgun. you got *-1 to go through their course and get certified *-2 that you know how * to properly handle the weapon *t*-1, how * to safely handle the weapon *t*-3, how * to properly maintain it *t*-4, the three basics.###speakera47.###well, that makes a lot of since to me.###i mean, i certainly feel that if, if, we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm *t*-1
59632:56	well as, as someone who *t*-2 would, would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander, i feel more comfortable with people having blades because, uh, you're not going *-1 to get bullets flying around *-3 killing people instantly	possibly	###speakera105.###uh-huh.###speakerb106.###say 0 a person, uh, uh, get,###all of a sudden my combat in me goes up###and say 0 i've got the vibes, 0 this guy's fixing *-1 to do something,###i go ahead and pull my piece.###speakera107.###uh-huh.###speakerb108.###and i make * sure 0 this persons sees it so that he's got now doubt that i will use it on him and i will use it right then.###speakera109.###uh-huh.###speakerb110.###if he doesn't back up at that point he deserves what he gets *t*-1 because i have sent the clearest signal 0 you mess with me, you mess with my family, i'm going *-2 to dust you.###as it stands now i've got *-1 to do that with a blade.###and the only reason 0 i feel confid-, com-, com-, comfortable *-2 doing that *t*-3 is because of the training 0 i've had *t*-1.###speakera111.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.
59647:8	they probably, need *-1 to change it somehow, uh,	probably	###as it stands now i've got *-1 to do that with a blade.###and the only reason 0 i feel confid-, com-, com-, comfortable *-2 doing that *t*-3 is because of the training 0 i've had *t*-1.###speakera111.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###well as, as someone who *t*-2 would, would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander, i feel more comfortable with people having blades because, uh, you're not going *-1 to get bullets flying around *-3 killing people instantly###and, uh,###speakerb112.###well, if i'm the one doing the shooting i don't miss.###that's the kind of training 0 i've had *t*-1.###i mean...###speakera1.###well, i don't, i mean, i don't know what you think *t*-1 about the, subject,### i'd, the, i had never really thought of what they said *t*-2 before about * allowing the, the sentencing to, uh, to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that.###i've been kind of *-1 sitting here thinking about that a little bit while i was waiting for them to phone somebody,###and i don't know that that's not a good idea.###speakerb2.###that's not a bad idea###i,###um, uh, that, you know,
59649:87	we've just got too many people in there, and, uh, mumblex, are putting too many, uh, people *ich*-1 in jail that *t*-2 probably don't need *-3 to be there	probably	###speakera111.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###well as, as someone who *t*-2 would, would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander, i feel more comfortable with people having blades because, uh, you're not going *-1 to get bullets flying around *-3 killing people instantly###and, uh,###speakerb112.###well, if i'm the one doing the shooting i don't miss.###that's the kind of training 0 i've had *t*-1.###i mean...###speakera1.###well, i don't, i mean, i don't know what you think *t*-1 about the, subject,### i'd, the, i had never really thought of what they said *t*-2 before about * allowing the, the sentencing to, uh, to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that.###i've been kind of *-1 sitting here thinking about that a little bit while i was waiting for them to phone somebody,###and i don't know that that's not a good idea.###speakerb2.###that's not a bad idea###i,###um, uh, that, you know,###they probably, need *-1 to change it somehow, uh,###the whole system needs changing,
59701:37	and they were told *-1 that, uh, he would probably serve three, of the fifteen, and that he had three previous convictions.	probably	###and, he was a courier.###speakerb12.###right.###speakera13.###and, uh, they, he's, he sat on that jury###and they found him guilty,###and they went through the sentencing phase and everything###and, uh, you know, they were told *-1 that, you know, during the trial that this is this guy's first offense###and he's got this clean record,### and, and they ended up,###the jury, you know, decided, hey, it's time 0 * to crackdown here *t*-1, you know,###and it was time 0 * to do this drug thing *t*-1###and * let's crackdown###and * let's really,###and they sentenced him to fifteen years, you know, which they thought first offense, okay, this is, they thought that that was, *t*-1 that was a good thing.###speakerb14.###uh-huh.###speakera15.###and they sentencing him to fifteen years###and, um, after it was all over, uh, the jud-, they sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers,, * let me come over in just a second, okay, and sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers
59736:10	the judge might know	might	###speakera23.### and so, you know, we'll give him fifteen which *t*-1 will teach him a lesson###but it's not just, you know, horrible, since it was first offense###speakerb24.###yeah.###speakera25.###and he'd been convicted *-1 three times before, you know,###speakerb26.###oh.###speakera27.### and, and the jury was very upset###and my husband came home, a home, * very upset,###i mean, he felt like that, that they had been tricked *-1, you know,###speakerb28.###right.###speakera29.### and so something,###i wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if some of that would change, you know.###speakerb30.###yeah,
59749:13	well, we definitely need a change in the system	definitely	###speakerb28.###right.###speakera29.### and so something,###i wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if some of that would change, you know.###speakerb30.###yeah,###the judge might know###or at least it, it *exp*-1 wouldn't hurt * to switch over there and see if it worked any better,###if it didn't we can come back for something else###or,###speakera31.###that's true.###that's very true.###speakerb32.### or, or what we've got *t*-1,###so.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.
59795:21	and, and maybe so,	maybe	###so.###speakera45.###that's very true.###speakerb46.###yeah.###speakera47.###yeah,###i was talking to a friend of mine about this the other day###and i said, you know, 0 i understand that there are a lot of countries that *t*-1 rely on the united states, * to### and, and the, and the people in those countries rely on our money * to survive###speakerb48.###uh-huh.###speakera49.###but i really believe that we need *-1 to take care of ourselves,###speakerb50.###right.###speakera51.###i mean, we,### and, and the-,###i know 0 people say, oh, 0 it *exp*-1 would be cruel * to, you know, pull our aid from these other countries
59850:12	and, * maybe let the judge have a opportunity 0 * to make, a decision *t*-1.	maybe	###and i, i feel sorry for them###and i know 0 they're suffering###and i know 0 they're dying everyday,###but we've got, you know, kids *ich*-2 here in the united states that *t*-1 are dying everyday, too. you know, and being, abused and neglected *-3###speakerb68.###sure.###speakera69.###speakerb70.###oh.###speakera71.###and, you know, i don't know.###i just have this problem with, uh, * trying *-1 to heal the world when you're so sick yourself *t*-2, you know,###speakerb72.###you bet.###speakera73.###so.###speakerb74.###right.###well, we seem *-1 to agree on the jury thing### and, uh, but, uh, we'll need an unanimous verdict
59906:4	probably,	probably	###yeah,### we had cat, you know, my family had cats when we were growing up *t*-1 the whole time until my mom developed an allergies,###speakerb6.###uh-huh.###speakera7.###so, i mean, i'm used, i'm used to *-1 having cats around,###i like them.###speakerb8.###yeah,###i like *-1 having ca-, cats around or pets around in general### i, i favor dogs over cats actually###but,###speakera9.###oh, see, i'm not, uh, i'm not a dog person at all.###speakerb10.###oh, i'm, i'm a dog person.###i had,###i guess 0 it depends on what you had *t*-1 when he were a kid *t*-2, right?.###speakera11.###yeah,
59926:22	it was like, hey, maybe you're still allergic to the dog.	maybe	###probably,###i was allergic to dogs when i was a kid *t*-1, in fact,###speakerb12.###uh-huh.###speakera13.###i may still be *?*,###um, we,###speakerb14.###but not cats.###speakera15.###that, um,###i wonder sometimes.###speakerb16.###uh-huh.###speakera17.###um, but we, um, we house sat for a, um, my, um, my wife's boss a couple weeks ago###and, um, uh, he has a dog and everything,### we were, you know, we were sitting the dog and everything###and, uh, i felt like just miserable all weekend###and it really didn't dawn on me until sunday,
60149:33	i could see some *-1 having, maybe some of the tropical fish, that *t*-2 are really, really pretty	maybe	###but i've just never s-, seen the attraction of * having fish.###it's not as much fun.###speakerb82.###well, a friend of mine had, um, an eel,###speakera83.###an eel?###speakerb84.###and then he had a, um,###i forget what type of fish it was *t*-1,###it was one of these fish that i-, it would eat, *t*-1 it ate a big other fish and things like that.###there would be sort of moby fish in a tank.###speakera85.###oh, now we really get sick.###speakerb86.###yeah,###and it,### i, i couldn't see *-1 having fish like that.###speakera87.###yeah.###speakerb88.
60272:59	it *exp*-1's not fair to a pet *ich*-2 * to have a pet here, or certainly, certainly not a dog,	certainly	### and but,###speakera123.###yeah,### i, i, i have friends with hamsters and gerbils###and they, they tell me the same thing.###speakerb124.###uh-huh.###speakera125.###i just,###again it gets into vivant much fun,, you know what, i guess 0 they can be *?*.###i,###speakerb126.###actually it was more fun than you would think. yeah, * starting from the beginning###but, um,###yeah,###we live, also live in the city now, actually in manhattan.###speakera127.###okay.###speakerb128.###and so it *exp*-1's almost impossible * to,
60272:67	it *exp*-1's not fair to a pet *ich*-2 * to have a pet here, or certainly, certainly not a dog,	certainly	### and but,###speakera123.###yeah,### i, i, i have friends with hamsters and gerbils###and they, they tell me the same thing.###speakerb124.###uh-huh.###speakera125.###i just,###again it gets into vivant much fun,, you know what, i guess 0 they can be *?*.###i,###speakerb126.###actually it was more fun than you would think. yeah, * starting from the beginning###but, um,###yeah,###we live, also live in the city now, actually in manhattan.###speakera127.###okay.###speakerb128.###and so it *exp*-1's almost impossible * to,
60315:37	last time 0 i was there *t*-1 was fall so probably wasn't that bad.	probably	###we were wondering if they, uh, they had any special law for the horses in central park.###speakerb138.###right,###no,###they don't.###i should make you,###speakera139.###of course, not.###speakerb140.###they have, um, the bags behind them###but i think 0 they're actually supposed *-1 to, mumblex keep them, yeah, keep them clean###speakera141.###* hit the bags.###speakerb142.###but, oh, gosh, i can't even walk by central park yeah when summertime,###just the smell *ich*-1 is so bad, of the horses.###speakera143.###oh, god, i can't, haven't been up there,###speakerb144.###speakera145.
60565:40	and there's lots and lots of companies that *t*-1 have maybe not in the de-, the defense area but manufacturing in general.	maybe	### there's, you know, there's benefits###and there's things that *t*-1 weren't as good,###speakera57.###yeah.###speakerb58.###but as an overall package, i'd say 0 i'm pretty happy *ich*-1 so far with the way 0 it's turned out *t*-2.###speakera59.###good,###good.###well, it hasn't been a long time mumblex t i###or i, i'm significantly shaken *-1 by the situation, but not devastated *-1.###speakerb60.###uh-huh.###speakera61.###speakerb62.###right.###speakera63.###speakerb64.###uh-huh.###well, the one thing i guess 0 *t*-1 at least in your favor is the, the fact that, that is more in the support of the manufacturing
60573:124	and, and i seem rather happy about it *ich*-2 most of the time, *-3 just, just to know, what's, possibilities *t*-1 are, you know, what *t*-4 might happen.	might	###good.###well, it hasn't been a long time mumblex t i###or i, i'm significantly shaken *-1 by the situation, but not devastated *-1.###speakerb60.###uh-huh.###speakera61.###speakerb62.###right.###speakera63.###speakerb64.###uh-huh.###well, the one thing i guess 0 *t*-1 at least in your favor is the, the fact that, that is more in the support of the manufacturing###and there's lots and lots of companies that *t*-1 have maybe not in the de-, the defense area but manufacturing in general.###speakera65.###* to tell you the truth, i'm, i'm, i'm not really worried.###speakerb66.###uh-huh.###that's great.###that's good.###speakera67.
60705:7	and maybe i'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if i don't get laid *-1 off between now and then.	maybe	###momentum is, uh, driving force in our lives.###speakerb114.###uh-huh.###speakera115.### but, so, yeah,###i'm looking as, as a opportunity.###speakerb116.###well, that's good,###you've got a good attitude about it.###speakera117.### and, and i'm looking at it as a change.###speakerb118.###uh-huh.###speakera119.###and i'm looking at it as, as an adventure.###speakerb120.###right,###there you go *t*-1.###that's the way 0 * to do it *t*-1.###speakera121.
60799:62	you know, wh-, when you consider, you know, 0 it's probably not radioactive *t*-1	probably	###speakerb20.###oh.###speakera21.###and i'm like, if they're getting away with it, can you imagine,###speakerb22.###right.###speakera23.### that's a, that's a pillsbury plant###i can't imagine plants,###speakerb24.###i wouldn't have thought that pillsbury could, would, the, i mean, or even had chem-, you know, well,###those chemicals would not,###speakera25.###yeah,###they have chemicals that they use *t*-1 *-2 to refine their flours with *?* and stuff, you know 0 *t*-3 to, to break the flours down###speakerb26.###yeah.###speakera27.###and then they, they also do testing there,###and i don't,
60853:15	it *exp*-2's probably a lot easier *ich*-4 * to detect things that *t*-1 go into the ground than it *exp*-3 is maybe *?* * to just,	probably	###speakerb40.###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###but, um, we, we're on the southwest side of houston###we don't have that much as far as, uh, * aiming in the plants over on this, uh,###the we-, east side does.###speakera43.###uh-huh.###speakerb44.###we've got imperial sugar### but, uh, and they're, you know, they're right there on the creek also###and, uh, they've been there for years.###speakera45.###yeah.###speakerb46.###and, uh,###speakera47.###but,###i mean, you think about it, it, you know,
60853:77	it *exp*-2's probably a lot easier *ich*-4 * to detect things that *t*-1 go into the ground than it *exp*-3 is maybe *?* * to just,	maybe	###speakerb40.###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###but, um, we, we're on the southwest side of houston###we don't have that much as far as, uh, * aiming in the plants over on this, uh,###the we-, east side does.###speakera43.###uh-huh.###speakerb44.###we've got imperial sugar### but, uh, and they're, you know, they're right there on the creek also###and, uh, they've been there for years.###speakera45.###yeah.###speakerb46.###and, uh,###speakera47.###but,###i mean, you think about it, it, you know,
61160:42	and, i would think, you know, 0 he might, i mean, he might could get hurt *-1 by a car or something.	might	###and so this is just really strange, you know because,###speakerb10.###what kind of a dog is he *t*-1?###speakera11.###um, he's part golden lab and part, uh,, * let's see, alaskan,###no, not alaskan.###i always forget.###speakerb12.###yeah.###speakera13.###uh, australian shepherd.###speakerb14.###oh,###speakera15.###and, yeah,###speakerb16.###boy, he's a big one.###speakera17.###he's pretty big.###that's why it *exp*-2 really surprises me, you know, that he hasn't come back, because, like i said, he's never gone away like this before *t*-1,
61160:64	and, i would think, you know, 0 he might, i mean, he might could get hurt *-1 by a car or something.	might	###and so this is just really strange, you know because,###speakerb10.###what kind of a dog is he *t*-1?###speakera11.###um, he's part golden lab and part, uh,, * let's see, alaskan,###no, not alaskan.###i always forget.###speakerb12.###yeah.###speakera13.###uh, australian shepherd.###speakerb14.###oh,###speakera15.###and, yeah,###speakerb16.###boy, he's a big one.###speakera17.###he's pretty big.###that's why it *exp*-2 really surprises me, you know, that he hasn't come back, because, like i said, he's never gone away like this before *t*-1,
61304:10	you most likely will *?*.	likely	###speakerb60.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera61.###you know, he's just always been right there when he gets out *t*-1.###speakerb62.###oh.###speakera63.###you know, it's the first time 0 he's ever been gone like this *t*-1.###speakerb64.###oh, that's really too bad,###that's awful,###well,###speakera65.###uh, i, i just knew today, uh, you know, that we looked at the pound, and that we just went all over the place,###and i knew 0 we were going *-1 to find him, you know,###and when we didn't *t*-1 it was, like, oh, no,.###so i don't know.###speakerb66.###well, i, i'll, i hope 0 you'll find him.
61338:30	i, we will probably will put some things up. some posters and stuff up.	probably	###speakerb70.###uh-huh,###yeah.###speakera71.###you know, but we just don't have a whole lot.###we have him on film, you know, on the video camera.###speakerb72.###uh-huh,###uh-huh,###yeah.###speakera73.###you know, but you can't put that on the,###speakerb74.###no,###you sure can't *?*.###speakera75.###you know, so, so, i don't know,###speakerb76.###oh, dear.###speakera77.
61342:31	and hopefully that will help, you know, maybe around the neighborhood.	maybe	###you know, but we just don't have a whole lot.###we have him on film, you know, on the video camera.###speakerb72.###uh-huh,###uh-huh,###yeah.###speakera73.###you know, but you can't put that on the,###speakerb74.###no,###you sure can't *?*.###speakera75.###you know, so, so, i don't know,###speakerb76.###oh, dear.###speakera77.### i, we will probably will put some things up. some posters and stuff up.###speakerb78.###well, that's good.###speakera79.
61427:19	and, i think 0 maybe he would *?* if it came real close,	maybe	###speakera103.###so that would make you really, tend *-1 to worry about them, you know, if they're not right there###speakerb104.###yeah.###speakera105.###speakerb106.###yeah.###well, but he's a real feisty guy.###he fights with other cats in the neighborhood because he doesn't want them on our property.###speakera107.###is that right?###speakerb108.###he's,###cats are really almost more territorial than, than dogs are *?*.###they just really do not want other animals on their property.###they're very, very### he, he just###any cat that *t*-1 comes near, and even a dog he won't, he won't jump at them or anything,###but he'll sit###and he'll watch,
61558:21	i guess 0 that's probably true.	probably	###so i can't,### i, i, i just have not,###i don't understand, you know, because it's, like, he's got a good home, you know,###he's got,###i mean, we have two kids, you know, that *t*-1 just love him a lot,###speakerb152.###yeah,###yeah.###speakera153.###you know, it's like we can't understand why he kept *-1 wanting *-1 to get out *t*-2, you know,###we just couldn't *?*,###speakerb154.###well, you know, that, animals are like that.###they like *-1 to roam and investigate. and see what *t*-2's going on.###speakera155.###yeah.###i guess 0 that's,###speakerb156.###speakera157.###yeah,
61738:29	well, actually one other thing 0 i might ought *-2 to mention *t*-1 is that they are actually getting quite cheap.	might	###and if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending letters###or if you don't want *-1 to build a data base * to keep track of the nuts and bolts in your garage,###whatever### there, your issue is then there really,###speakerb18.###well, uh, space is a handicap with me,###i live in a motor home.###speakera19.###oh, i see###well.###speakerb20.###and i'm preparing for retirement.###speakera21.###i see###well, congratulations on that.###speakerb22.###and i'm not to far from it###another year and a half.###speakera23.###yeah,
61741:4	definitely,	definitely	### there, your issue is then there really,###speakerb18.###well, uh, space is a handicap with me,###i live in a motor home.###speakera19.###oh, i see###well.###speakerb20.###and i'm preparing for retirement.###speakera21.###i see###well, congratulations on that.###speakerb22.###and i'm not to far from it###another year and a half.###speakera23.###yeah,###well, actually one other thing 0 i might ought *-2 to mention *t*-1 is that they are actually getting quite cheap.###speakerb24.###yes,
61801:5	probably the way 0 * to do it if you really wanted *-1 to buy one *t*-2 is 0 there's a magazine called * computer shopper.	probably	###but i'm, i'm, that does amaze me.###speakera39.###yeah,###the prices had plummeted,###you can buy the computer the guts just the guts with the power supply, the box and the mother board of a type of computer called * an eighty, eighty-eight, for about two hundred dollars.###speakerb40.###uh-huh.###speakera41.###speakerb42.###huh.###speakera43.###and then the keyboard is another fifty,###the monitor with the card that * drives *t*-1 is another hundred###and then the disk drive is two fifty.###speakerb44.###well, what, what is a a good brand a inexpensive *t*-1.###speakera45.###well, that's that's the deal is 0 you're not buying brands now,###you're buying these knock offs,###so there's,
61810:13	and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages.	probably	###huh.###speakera43.###and then the keyboard is another fifty,###the monitor with the card that * drives *t*-1 is another hundred###and then the disk drive is two fifty.###speakerb44.###well, what, what is a a good brand a inexpensive *t*-1.###speakera45.###well, that's that's the deal is 0 you're not buying brands now,###you're buying these knock offs,###so there's,###probably the way 0 * to do it if you really wanted *-1 to buy one *t*-2 is 0 there's a magazine called * computer shopper.###speakerb46.###uh-huh.###speakera47.###it's a big magazine,###it's twelve inches acro-, narrow, the narrow side and seventeen inches the tall side###speakerb48.###oh, wow.###speakera49.
61827:11	it's probably a half a dozen companies *ich*-2 around the world that *t*-1 are making those mother boards, the main computer, the circuit board.	probably	###speakerb48.###oh, wow.###speakera49.###and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages.###but the book is, the magazine is full of these mail order, computer mail-order houses###and they're all competing with each.###speakerb50.###uh-huh.###speakera51.###so you just flip through there until you find a eighty, eighty-eight computer### that that's called, it's the original p c.###so it's,###we call the t i, i'm sorry an i b m p c compatible.### and you'll find all these things and you'll find the monitors forty dollars and the card that *t*-1 drives the monitor that *t*-2 goes in the back of the board for twenty-five dollars which *t*-3 is amazing to me.###speakerb52.###uh.###speakera53.###and you mix and match###and then you do it by mail-order.###but there's no real brands
61938:8	they certainly are *?*.	certainly	###speakera91.###yeah.###speakerb92.###i just run a printout every week### and and it puts me right up-to-date what i'm, what i have *-1 to do *t*-2, what i have *-3 to ship *t*-4, what i should be expecting *t*-5 to be returned *-7.###speakera93.###uh-huh.###speakerb94.###so a,### it it is handy.###speakera95.###right.###speakerb96.###and i must admit that up until i did start *-1 using one, uh, it was, i had very little interest in computers.###speakera97.###yes.###speakerb98.###but they are amazing.###speakera99.###yeah,
61979:29	and i don't know that it *exp*-1 might do them a little bit of good * to see the world from a different perspective.	might	###huh?###okay.###speakerb2.###i don't know how much *ich*-1 i know *t*-2 about this subject.###speakera3.###well, i don't know if i know anything or not,###speakerb4.###yeah.###speakera5.###but i've, i've got some opinions on it.###speakerb6.###okay.###* go ahead.###speakera7.###see those type of people that, that *t*-2 have the most opinions, ones that *t*-1 don't know anything.###speakerb8.###yeah.###speakera9.###well, uh, i've had teenagers###and i now have grandchildren that *t*-1 are teenagers,
62033:57	i think 0 that's a good way for people to, you know, maybe get people to come back to these small towns *-3 to work by *-4 helping people that *t*-1 normally might not be able *-2 to go to college and get the type of degree 0 they want *t*-5.	maybe	###yeah,###she only taught there one year###but i,###speakera19.###but she got credits for it?###speakerb20.###uh-huh.###speakera21.###that's very interesting.###speakerb22.###and, um, i think 0 it would be,###i know that also one of my cousins who, uh, *t*-1 he is in like the therapy type thing###and he was, um,###some group paid part of his college income###but then he was required *-1 to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at, uh, uh,###i mean, it's a nursing home or something like that.###speakera23.###huh.###speakerb24.###so, you know, if,
62033:124	i think 0 that's a good way for people to, you know, maybe get people to come back to these small towns *-3 to work by *-4 helping people that *t*-1 normally might not be able *-2 to go to college and get the type of degree 0 they want *t*-5.	might	###yeah,###she only taught there one year###but i,###speakera19.###but she got credits for it?###speakerb20.###uh-huh.###speakera21.###that's very interesting.###speakerb22.###and, um, i think 0 it would be,###i know that also one of my cousins who, uh, *t*-1 he is in like the therapy type thing###and he was, um,###some group paid part of his college income###but then he was required *-1 to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at, uh, uh,###i mean, it's a nursing home or something like that.###speakera23.###huh.###speakerb24.###so, you know, if,
62100:10	but it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that *t*-4 have everything *ich*-2 given *-1 to them that they want *t*-3 to see what it's like *t*-6 if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want *t*-5 when you want it *t*-7.	definitely	###speakerb44.###* make them more self-supporting?###speakera45.###yes.###they,###speakerb46.###yeah.###speakera47.###it's not a program 0 *t*-1 to teach them *-2 to use the american money,###it's a program 0 *t*-3 to teach them *-4 to be more self-reliant.###speakerb48.###right.###yeah.###speakera49.###and, yes,###you're right,###i think 0 it's a sixties program.###i think 0 it was one of kennedy's hot points that he,###that was his big deal.###speakerb50.
62138:7	and maybe this is why this has died out *t*-1.	maybe	###mandatory just like, like the draft.###speakerb58.###speakera59.###speakerb60.###speakera61.###no.###speakerb62.###i don't know that that would work if, somebody's, was, didn't really want *-1 to be there and didn't have,###speakera63.###every time 0 you,###speakerb64.###speakera65.###they could buy their way out.###speakerb66.###yeah,###i mean, there would be loopholes just like there is *?* in anything else.###speakera67.###right,###you know, they, they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat.###but,, i'm wondering if there's another issue here,
62198:105	down here with the peace corps we're talking about all these people that *t*-1 aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that i think 0 *t*-2 probably need help and, could be helped *-3 *t*-4.	probably	###sad little things. uh, i felt sorry for them. because their society isn't there anymore,###and their belief system and a-, all their structured of theirs, all the structures of their society are gone, essentially.###speakerb80.###yeah.###speakera81.###and they're just kind of more like a side show than anything else###and that's sad.###speakerb82.###yeah.###speakera83.###but i don't think 0 there's any way 0 you could go, uh, the peace corps could go in and rescue those people *t*-1,###and i don't think 0 you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either.###speakerb84.###yeah.###speakera85.###so, i, i'm wondering if the peace corps is, really an effective tool.###speakerb86.###well,###speakera87.###speakerb88.
62211:7	and maybe rather than * just, require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like, um, during college, you know, * maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required *-1 to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the united states *t*-2.	maybe	###yeah.###speakera85.###so, i, i'm wondering if the peace corps is, really an effective tool.###speakerb86.###well,###speakera87.###speakerb88.###down here with the peace corps we're talking about all these people that *t*-1 aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that i think 0 *t*-2 probably need help and, could be helped *-3 *t*-4.###speakera89.###good point.###speakerb90.###speakera91.###we've got enough without lea-, without a passport###there's plenty.###speakerb92.###yeah.###speakera93.###yes.###i think 0 we ought *-1 to worry about our own species.###speakerb94.
62211:55	and maybe rather than * just, require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like, um, during college, you know, * maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required *-1 to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the united states *t*-2.	maybe	###yeah.###speakera85.###so, i, i'm wondering if the peace corps is, really an effective tool.###speakerb86.###well,###speakera87.###speakerb88.###down here with the peace corps we're talking about all these people that *t*-1 aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that i think 0 *t*-2 probably need help and, could be helped *-3 *t*-4.###speakera89.###good point.###speakerb90.###speakera91.###we've got enough without lea-, without a passport###there's plenty.###speakerb92.###yeah.###speakera93.###yes.###i think 0 we ought *-1 to worry about our own species.###speakerb94.

62217:8	there probably are *?*, you know,	probably	###speakerb88.###down here with the peace corps we're talking about all these people that *t*-1 aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that i think 0 *t*-2 probably need help and, could be helped *-3 *t*-4.###speakera89.###good point.###speakerb90.###speakera91.###we've got enough without lea-, without a passport###there's plenty.###speakerb92.###yeah.###speakera93.###yes.###i think 0 we ought *-1 to worry about our own species.###speakerb94.###and maybe rather than * just, require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like, um, during college, you know, * maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required *-1 to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the united states *t*-2.###speakera95.###i wonder now in,###and i've been out of school too long * to answer this,###but i wonder if there aren't some sociology courses.###speakerb96.
62220:11	that's probably like	probably	###good point.###speakerb90.###speakera91.###we've got enough without lea-, without a passport###there's plenty.###speakerb92.###yeah.###speakera93.###yes.###i think 0 we ought *-1 to worry about our own species.###speakerb94.###and maybe rather than * just, require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like, um, during college, you know, * maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required *-1 to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the united states *t*-2.###speakera95.###i wonder now in,###and i've been out of school too long * to answer this,###but i wonder if there aren't some sociology courses.###speakerb96.###there probably are *?*, you know,###for###but i'm sure,
62280:83	so, we're a little fa-, you know, farther removed from like dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing *t*-1.	probably	###speakerb110.###yeah,###i mean it's,###speakera111.###speakerb112.###true.###yeah.###speakera113.###i think 0 that's a lot more realistic.###uh, i, i think that we should be spending more time### and, and again i don't think 0 the, the peace corps is, is as successful now simply because it's not. it doesn't fit the circumstance anymore.###speakerb114.###yeah.###speakera115.###uh, we've got plenty,###in fact, we've got far too many.###you're in, uh, what r-, flower mound?###speakerb116.###flower mound,###yeah.
62378:29	these things won't make any sense to you probably	probably	###well, we bought a computer because my husband needed *-1 to use it * to do some work for a consulting project,###and we called up the company and asked them details on it.###we bought it sort of, your not a name brand because the clones are so much cheaper.###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb30.###and we called up the company that somebody else 0 we knew *t*-1 had dealt with *t*-2,###and they were very happy with the system,###and they felt 0 they've gotten a good price.###and we went in,###we explained what we needed *t*-1###and yes###we had *-1 to go across the george washington bridge to new jersey *-2 to get, to meet these people.###speakera31.###uh-huh.###speakerb32.###and so we went there,###we told them about the stuff###and the guy said, uh, that the computer would fit our needs.###and we,
62425:8	they probably didn't know what they were talking about *t*-1.	probably	###but we tried *-1 to figure out whether we could put three in because we really need *-2 to be able *-3 to put at least three in.###speakera41.###huh.###speakerb42.###and,###speakera43.###oh, no,###the computer was supposed *-1 to have two.###speakerb44.###well, it has them###but the problem is that you can't put the type of card that we need *t*-1 to put in it, in it. and even though they told us in advance that you could *?*,###speakera45.###oh, i see.###speakerb46.###they told us 0 there would be no problem because, you know, the salesman just doesn't really know.###speakera47.###i see.###speakerb48.###speakera49.###in some ways it has more *-2 to do with the people who *t*-1 sold it.
62587:50	i think 0 this is a, i think 0 this is maybe a name brand	maybe	###speakera103.###so, uh,###speakerb104.###what brand is it *t*-1?###do you know?###speakera105.###yeah,###so i, i wish 0 i could tell you###i really don't know which brand it is *t*-1.###it's,###speakerb106.###but i was wondering like, you know###in our case where we knew 0 we were buying a copy *t*-1###we weren't buying, on i b m p c###speakera107.###yeah.###speakerb108.###and i was wondering if you,###speakera109.###no,
62588:23	and i suspect that it's probably, just a fluke, you know.	probably	###so, uh,###speakerb104.###what brand is it *t*-1?###do you know?###speakera105.###yeah,###so i, i wish 0 i could tell you###i really don't know which brand it is *t*-1.###it's,###speakerb106.###but i was wondering like, you know###in our case where we knew 0 we were buying a copy *t*-1###we weren't buying, on i b m p c###speakera107.###yeah.###speakerb108.###and i was wondering if you,###speakera109.###no,### i think 0 this is a, i think 0 this is maybe a name brand
62681:79	and it kind of has *-1 to start from the top and, and go clea-, or from the bottom maybe and go clear up.	maybe	###speakera139.###well, they may cost a little more,###but they don't have *-1 to take them to the shop every other day.###speakerb140.###yeah,###i had a toyota###and i loved it.###speakera141.###yeah.###speakerb142.###my toyota did, really well.###speakera143.### it does the, it did a good job,###speakerb144.###speakera145.###so, part of it is that we need *-1 to develop more of a, of a pride in, in, uh, the kinds of things 0 we do *t*-2 so we make them better.###speakerb146.###good.###yeah.###speakera147.
62748:24	it probab-, it probably basically goes right back into the h-, home though unfortunately.	probably	###speakerb166.###because the companies that, *t*-1 let, give the attitude that, well, you know,###you're the last one hired *###so you'll be the first one fired *,###speakera167.###speakerb168.###and we just want you to do your day's work,###speakera169.###yeah.###speakerb170.###and we don't really care about you, as an individual.###speakera171.###yeah.###speakerb172.###when you've got that type of attitude on it *t*-1, the people don't care, about their work.###speakera173.###no.###speakerb174.###and so,###speakera175.
62882:30	i think 0 i've been *?* two maybe three times the month of april,	maybe	###speakerb34.###because i teach school,###and last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class.###we went in *-1 together and hired a private instructor,###and she came to our school twice a week.###speakera35.###uh-huh.###speakerb36.###and, i, i was,###i would go faithfully,###and then i missed once.###speakera37.###speakerb38.###then i went back again a couple times and missed another time, and then kept *-1 missing and never went back again.###speakera39.###uh-huh.###speakerb40.###i think, 0 if you, you just have *-1 to stick with it.###speakera41.###oh, yeah.
63067:99	so, you know, you, not only, you know, you're not only doing something *-1 to keep yourself fit, but you're probably prolonging your life.	probably	###well, i just got over the flu,###and i'm still kind of draggy###so i better *-1 not go.###speakerb92.###it's kind of a vicious circle isn't it *?*?###speakera93.###yeah,###it really is *?*.###speakerb94.###yeah,###i find, too, that i have more energy when i exercise *t*-1,###and, you know, it *exp*-1's silly * not to *?*,###but, i don't know,###it's just a put off.###i don't know why i don't do more *t*-1,### and i, and i know that it's good for my health.###i know, you know, from everything that you read *t*-1 and you see *t*-1 on television now, 0 exercise is so important to good health.###speakera95.###right.###speakerb96.
63084:25	so i think 0 a tuesday thursday might be a little bit better.	might	###speakera95.###right.###speakerb96.###so, you know, you, not only, you know, you're not only doing something *-1 to keep yourself fit, but you're probably prolonging your life.###so.###speakera97.###right.###speakerb98.###there's no reason that we shouldn't do it *t*-1,###but i don't know.###speakera99.###it *exp*-1's just hard * to make yourself go.###and i, i think 0 one thing 0 i don't like *t*-1 about aerobics is that after i'm finished it's kind of late at night,###and i've been sweaty,### and, and it, you know,###i don't really feel like *-2 going in the grocery store *-1 all sweaty or running errands.###speakerb100.###yeah.###speakera101.###so it kind of kills the evening for * doing errands.
63088:57	of course, i feel like once i've done it, if i'm sweaty i might as well do an extra thirty minutes, because you've already kind of shot your night.	might	###so.###speakera97.###right.###speakerb98.###there's no reason that we shouldn't do it *t*-1,###but i don't know.###speakera99.###it *exp*-1's just hard * to make yourself go.###and i, i think 0 one thing 0 i don't like *t*-1 about aerobics is that after i'm finished it's kind of late at night,###and i've been sweaty,### and, and it, you know,###i don't really feel like *-2 going in the grocery store *-1 all sweaty or running errands.###speakerb100.###yeah.###speakera101.###so it kind of kills the evening for * doing errands.###so i think 0 a tuesday thursday might be a little bit better.###speakerb102.###yeah.###speakera103.
63106:86	but i'm glad 0 it's not too totally cheap, because if it was too cheap i would talk myself out of *-1 going more, probably.	probably	###yeah.###speakera103.###of course, i feel like once i've done it, if i'm sweaty i might as well do an extra thirty minutes, because you've already kind of shot your night.###speakerb104.###right.###speakera105.###but, um, so i'm kind of glad 0 they have a longer class on tuesday, thursday now that i can just kill two nights, and and, uh, get a reasonable amount of workout in.###speakerb106.###yeah.###speakera107.###speakerb108.###does it cost the same for just two nights###or,###speakera109.###no,###it's less expensive.###speakerb110.###well, that's good, too.###speakera111.###this one was only forty-five dollars.
63154:31	they make it as easy *ich*-1 as they possibly can *?* for you.	possibly	###speakerb120.###yeah,###and then they hire private instructors?###speakera121.###uh-huh.###speakerb122.###oh, that's great.###speakera123.###and they have ceiling fans in the rooms,###and it's, it's a pretty nice setup.###um, and of course it's real convenient, because it is right there at work.###i think 0 if i had *-1 to come home and then go somewhere, i'd never make it.###speakerb124.###yeah.###speakera125.###and just the fact that i can go straight from my desk over to the, the recreation center and do it helps a lot.###speakerb126.###uh-huh.###yeah,###i can see 0 that would be, uh, easy.
63161:11	they have probably, ooh, i'd say *rnr*-2 fifteen different, fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that *t*-1 are running,	probably	###speakera123.###and they have ceiling fans in the rooms,###and it's, it's a pretty nice setup.###um, and of course it's real convenient, because it is right there at work.###i think 0 if i had *-1 to come home and then go somewhere, i'd never make it.###speakerb124.###yeah.###speakera125.###and just the fact that i can go straight from my desk over to the, the recreation center and do it helps a lot.###speakerb126.###uh-huh.###yeah,###i can see 0 that would be, uh, easy.###they make it as easy *ich*-1 as they possibly can *?* for you.###speakera127.###oh, yeah.###speakerb128.###well, um, do a lot of people take advantage of it?###speakera129.###quite a few do.
63322:32	the, uh, i think 0 maybe there's where the problem came in *t*-1, you know.	maybe	###speakera23.###when we finally out that liters was about a quart *t*-1, there's about four liters in a gallon###so you can figure out what you're actually paying *t*-1 for it.###speakerb24.###right.###it *exp*-1's kind of hard for me to believe that this day and age,###i don't know,###when i was growing up *t*-1, we were talking metric system in school.###i mean, not, not at first,###speakera25.###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###but by the time 0 i was in fifth or sixth grade *t*-1 anyway.###speakera27.###yeah.###oh.###speakerb28.###i would expect people with any kind of buying power over the age, you know, under the age of thirty or so, to have some idea what it is *t*-1, anyway.###a liter's about a quart.###speakera29.
63532:15	i thought 0 maybe they would convert to, uh, metric back when they went to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit *t*-1, because what is it *t*-2 fifty-six or fifty-seven's a hundred, uh, qua-, a hundred kilometers,	maybe	###part of it's built *-1 in canada.###matter of fact, the thing is, 0 i always say 0 it's built *-1 off shore, you know, because it was assembled *-2 in canada.###the only thing that *t*-1 was in it was built * in the u s was the, uh, differential,###and it was built *-1 in buffalo, new york.###but it's got the hardest combination of, uh, metric###and, most of the body parts seem *-1 to be metric,###and most of the engine parts seem *-1 to be s a e,###so. it's just crazy.###speakerb96.###right.###it just gets bad,###now, you got *-1 to, you got *-2 to have one, and not mix them up.###speakera97.###yeah.###speakerb98.###because you're never going *-1 to get to one, one system if you still got a, got a mix.###and of course, here that, that would involve * changing road signs all across the country, you know,###miles per hour to kilometers per hour, and the whole nine yards.###kind of hard 0 * to do *t*-1 gradually.###speakera99.
63881:18	i mean, i might not have that much,	might	###i don't have any little tiny kids,###speakera99.###uh-huh.###speakerb100.###but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now, in five years, when they get bigger *t*-1, it'll work a little bit more, too.###speakera101.###yeah.###speakerb102.###speakera103.###true.###speakerb104.###because it's,###we've all got *-1 to do it right now.###i just,###i really amazed *-3 to find out that, what is it *t*-1, eighty per cent are filled *-2 now, in, in garbage fills.###in five years we're supposed *-1 to be at max.###speakera105.###uh-huh.###speakerb106.###i don't think 0 i can keep my own garbage.
64131:7	but maybe that's what *t*-1 rounds it, i don't know.	maybe	###so it had come, it's a drop of water that *t*-1 had come through quite a few rain clouds apparently.###is that correct?###speakerb87.###uh, i don't know how hail is formed *-2 *t*-1 * to tell you the truth.###speakera88.### i think, i think 0 that's,###speakerb89.###speakera90.###speakerb91.###you don't think 0 it's cold enough, you know * to,###speakera92.###it's not *?* on the ground,###but in the clouds it is *?*.###speakerb93.###right,###* must be *?*.###speakera94.###speakerb95.###i guess,###and then, i think, you know, 0 all that falling would warm it up and melt it,
64249:41	but if i were *-1 to live some place else, it certainly meets my standards.	certainly	###uh-huh.###but you're not living there right now.###speakera134.###no,###i'm going *-1 to lease it.###speakerb135.###oh, i see.###speakera136.### it's, it's investment property.###speakerb137.###i see.###speakera138.###but it is really, it's a very nice place.###uh, i, i would cheerfully live there.###of course it's not my home,###and i've lived in my home in, well, almost ten years,###and, you know, i've got everything just exactly like i want it *t*-1.###speakerb139.###right.###speakera140.
64369:9	maybe, maybe i'm used to texas.	maybe	###speakerb177.###speakera178.###yes###speakerb179.###okay,###i know where that is *t*-1.###speakera180.###beyond thousand oaks.###speakerb181.###i know where mumblex valley is *t*-1,###i've been out there before,###sure.###speakera182.###you don't think 0 that's strange looking.###speakerb183.###i didn't notice anything strange, i guess about it.###speakera184.###oh, okay###speakerb185.###speakera186.
64369:17	maybe, maybe i'm used to texas.	maybe	###speakerb177.###speakera178.###yes###speakerb179.###okay,###i know where that is *t*-1.###speakera180.###beyond thousand oaks.###speakerb181.###i know where mumblex valley is *t*-1,###i've been out there before,###sure.###speakera182.###you don't think 0 that's strange looking.###speakerb183.###i didn't notice anything strange, i guess about it.###speakera184.###oh, okay###speakerb185.###speakera186.
64561:35	because baltimore will play more, uh, what *t*-1 might be considered *-2 m-, a little bit more progressive?	might	###speakerb38.###yeah,###yeah.###speakera39.###i'm the same way.###yeah.###it's funny, uh, depending on where you live *t*-1,### i, i, i commute back and forth between baltimore and a rural town called * salisbury, which *t*-1 is two and a half hours away,###speakerb40.###uh-huh.###speakera41.###and the difference in the radio with popular music, is totally different, you know,###speakerb42.###uh-huh.###speakera43.###when,###speakerb44.###oh, really?###speakera45.###yeah,
64582:167	if, you know, like when the doors movie came out *t*-1, you know, doors was really on the radio *ich*-3 there, you know. where, you know, you'd hear was-, one or two of their more famous songs, maybe top forty in baltimore *t*-2,	maybe	###speakerb46.###uh-huh.###speakera47.###and as soon as you go down to salisbury, this town that *t*-1's, you know, uh, two and a half hours away in the suburbs or whatever, uh, in a real rural balt-, uh, maryland, they, it turns into ber-, basically classic rock.###speakerb48.###yes?###speakera49.###speakerb50.###yeah?###speakera51.###and they don't, you know.###speakerb52.###oldies or what?###speakera53.###yeah,###mostly oldies.###speakerb54.###yeah.###speakera55.###but classic rock, you know, with,
64859:36	the n-, the next time, uh, probably a year and a half from now, we're going *-1 to try *-2 to build.	probably	###and so, uh,###speakera41.###with openness and light?###speakerb42.###yeah###that's,###speakera43.###i understand that,###i would love that too.###speakerb44.###uh, our, our last house wasn't too bad,###but it was just too traditional,###speakera45.###uh-huh.###speakerb46.###and so, if, uh,###speakera47.###yeah,###this is very traditional.###speakerb48.
64946:29	and the, the housing market probably still going *-1 to even go lower.	probably	###right,###uh-huh.###speakerb80.###so,###speakera81.###i was just reading an article, uh, that there were nineteen thousand properties available in texas, uh, for sale by the reso-, resolution trust com-, corporation?###speakerb82.###oh, yes.###speakera83.###repossessed.###speakerb84.###yes,###and if you get in the, if, if you can find one in the right area you can really pick up a steal.###speakera85.### i, i guess so.###speakerb86.###speakera87.###speakerb88.###uh, we, we really didn't go that route and didn't look.###uh, but, uh, the planning of them
65116:20	i pro-, probably should *?*.	probably	### and, and, of course, * being a woman, i like romance novels and stuff like that a whole lot.###i just,###i really enjoy that because it's kind of a, a getaway type thing.###speakera13.###uh-huh.###speakerb14.###so i, i read a lot of that.###but i also love sports.###and, uh, uh, i, i don't have time 0 * to read *t*-1 in,###but i do read sports illustrated * i-, during the, the year because my son gets that.###speakera15.###uh-huh.###speakerb16.###and, uh, but, uh, i don't read a lot of nonfiction,###and i really should *?* because there's so many self-improvement books out right now that *t*-1 would, would be, benefit me greatly,###but i just don't.###speakera17.###uh-huh.###yeah,### i, um, i don't really,
65247:36	well, i mean 0 he's doing all right, probably.	probably	###is that right?###speakera55.### wh-, which, you know,###when i read it *t*-2, i should have realized that because, i mean, it had foster's style written *-1 all over it.###speakerb56.###is that right?###speakera57.###yeah.###speakerb58.###uh-huh.###well, i, i've never read anything of his,###but i've heard about him.###but wouldn't you think 0 he would,###does he get some royalties from that, hopefully?###speakera59.###oh, i'm sure 0 he does.###speakerb60.###well, i would think 0 he would *?*.###speakera61.###i'd hope so.
65285:14	so you're probably, uh, a baltimore fan *ich*-1, right, an oriole fan?	probably	###right,###right.### i, in fact, i'm a sports fan, period.###speakera67.###uh-huh.###speakerb68.###we,###i mean, th-, that's why i like *-1 to read sports illustrated * so much *t*-2###because there's everything in it.###speakera69.###yeah.###i had a, uh, had a subscription to that last year,###but i'm, uh, i'm mostly a baseball fan.###so i'm, i'm not, as inter-, you know,###speakerb70.###oh.###speakera71.###the other stuff is interesting###but, um, i was mostly interested in the baseball stuff.###speakerb72.
65537:21	and it's takes us maybe, uh, we-, well, thirty-five to forty minutes *-1 to get there from plano, which *t*-2 is not too bad at all.	maybe	###speakera161.###uh-huh.###speakerb162.### and, and they,###it would have been devastated *-1,###they would have collapsed.###so i'm kind of glad 0 they're staying there. because it's right in the middle of fort worth-dallas,###and, you know,###speakera163.###yeah.### that's, that's what i'd always heard *t*-1,###i've, uh,###speakerb164.###yeah.### we, you know, we, i like it there.###and i think 0 dallas has enough *ich*-3 0 * to offer *t*-1 that they don't have *-2 to hog everything.###so, i'm glad that they're staying in arlington.###speakera165.###uh-huh.###speakerb166.
65600:7	so maybe i will *?*.	maybe	###uh-huh.###speakerb182.###and he reads everything 0 he gets, he gets his, get his hands on *t*-1.###he's reading a dick vitelle book right now because he's a real big dick vitelle fan.###speakera183.###um. huh.###speakerb184.###he's a basketball fan because he, he plays for the high school 0 he goes to *t*-1###and uh, * just loves d-, dick vitelle, which not many people do *t*-1.###speakera185.###speakerb186.### so, but he's reading it,###and he's r-,###and he says, he's so interesting, mom.###you just can't believe all the things 0 he's done *t*-1.###speakera187.###speakerb188.###and he's really enjoying that.###and i,###and he said, mom, you need *-1 to read it after i get finished *-2.
65675:30	they think 0 they need *-1 to, maybe have, uh, you know, private, you know, business, private enterprise come in.	maybe	###* have private enter-, enterprise do it?###speakerb8.###you mean the prisons?###speakera9.###uh-huh.###they're already talking about it.###i mean, they're talking about, uh, * having it, uh, as a, you know, business. uh, * to, uh, you know, * to, so, the, you know, the government doesn't have *-1 to deal with it.###speakerb10.###i hadn't heard that.###speakera11.###but, uh, yeah,###because i think 0 it's all funded, either state or federally funded### so, or, uh, obviously.###speakerb12.###right.###speakera13.### so, but, uh, but see they're, they don't have enough, uh, uh, you know, there's, there's not enough room in these prisons and that, and that, uh, * to continue *-1 funding it.###speakerb14.###but to me it,###speakera15.
65787:53	but, uh, you know, i think, 0 uh, they, maybe they need *-2 to, uh, help *-3 promote that more. give incentives like, uh, if they do bring somebody on, they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is *t*-1, you know, for them to train people, you know, stuff like that.	maybe	###yes.###speakera39.###okay.###speakerb40.###wow!###speakera41.###mumblex###yeah,###it was a cordless phone,###and all of a sudden we had a bad, uh, frequency *ich*-1 there or something.###so we had some interference,###so i changed that.###speakerb42.###yeah.###it sounded 0 you were calling from around the world somewhere.###speakera43.###anyway, so, uh,###speakerb44.###well,###speakera45.
66002:25	because we never know when we might, you know, get laid *-3 off or something *t*-4.	might	###speakerb49.###it's like, * let's see if we can get her to run up her bills.###speakera50.###speakerb51.###but it's hard,###i mean, it's, it *exp*-2's tempting when you see something *t*-1 * to say," well, i'll just charge it."###and sometimes i'll do that,###but usually i, i will try *-1 to pay everything off the next month###or the ones that *t*-1 usually have an outstanding balance all the time, i'll, i'll pay more than the minimum payment.###speakera52.###uh-huh.###speakerb53.###speakera54.###uh-huh.###speakerb55.###just i fe-, i feel like even that little bit helps.###speakera56.###right.###well, you know, the way 0 the economy's going *t*-1 and inflation and the recession and all that, i think 0 we, we really need *-2 to try *-3 to stay out of debt as much as possible.### that's, that's why i've, i've really started *-1 to try *-2 to, to pay off mine and get out of debt *t*-3.
66014:51	and i think 0 they're getting ready *-2 to, to probably sell us *ich*-1 out, our division.	probably	###speakera54.###uh-huh.###speakerb55.###just i fe-, i feel like even that little bit helps.###speakera56.###right.###well, you know, the way 0 the economy's going *t*-1 and inflation and the recession and all that, i think 0 we, we really need *-2 to try *-3 to stay out of debt as much as possible.### that's, that's why i've, i've really started *-1 to try *-2 to, to pay off mine and get out of debt *t*-3.###because we never know when we might, you know, get laid *-3 off or something *t*-4.###speakerb57.###i know it.###speakera58.###especially me.###i work for texas instruments,###and they've had, had a lot of, of, uh, you know, layoffs lately.###speakerb59.###well, i work for t i too.###speakera60.###you do?###speakerb61.
66034:23	it, it certainly is *?*.	certainly	###and i think 0 they're getting ready *-2 to, to probably sell us *ich*-1 out, our division.###speakera62.###where are you *t*-1?###speakerb63.###in johnson city, tennessee.###speakera64.###johnson city,###uh-huh.###i know 0 they're selling out somebody in colorado springs.###speakerb65.###yeah.###speakera66.###speakerb67.###yeah.### they just, they just announced that, didn't they *?*?###speakera68.###yeah.###speakerb69.###so, i mean, it's, it's kind of a bad time 0 * to be a slave to your credit cards *t*-1.###speakera70.
66118:8	you might even find 0 somebody's been reporting on you	might	###right.###speakerb95.###that's scary.###speakera96.###speakerb97.###speakera98.###a-, a-,###and, anyway, we need *-1 to watch our credit reports and all that kind of,###speakerb99.###that's something 0 i never thought about *-4 getting, you know, checking with *t*-2 *-3 to see what, what your credit report looked like *t*-1.###speakera100.###uh-huh.###well, you know, you, you can do that.###i believe 0 it costs about ten dollars.###speakerb101.###* might be worth it for peace of mind.###speakera102.###oh, yeah.###it is *?*,###it is *?*.
66120:41	you know, you, i mean you might think 0 you're paying something on time	might	###that's scary.###speakera96.###speakerb97.###speakera98.###a-, a-,###and, anyway, we need *-1 to watch our credit reports and all that kind of,###speakerb99.###that's something 0 i never thought about *-4 getting, you know, checking with *t*-2 *-3 to see what, what your credit report looked like *t*-1.###speakera100.###uh-huh.###well, you know, you, you can do that.###i believe 0 it costs about ten dollars.###speakerb101.###* might be worth it for peace of mind.###speakera102.###oh, yeah.###it is *?*,###it is *?*.###you might even find 0 somebody's been reporting on you###and you didn't even know it.
66228:32	so that's, that's probably the worst thing 0 i've ever had *t*-1 happen with a credit card.	probably	###speakera142.###uh-huh.###speakerb143.###i had ordered a sofa and had filled out the paperwork,###but they weren't supposed *-1 to process it until they delivered it.###speakera144.###uh-huh.###speakerb145.###and i changed my mind,###speakera146.###uh-huh.###speakerb147.###but then they went ahead and charged it on my account.###speakera148.###oh.###speakerb149.###and it *exp*-2 took me about eighteen months *-1 to get that, all of that mess off of my account.###speakera150.###wow!###speakerb151.
66310:109	um, i think if they, if they started *-1 executing them on a regular basis, uh, that i think 0 it might make a difference.	might	###and it was just, uh, amazing to me,###and of course they made a big deal out of the, the few that *t*-1 got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of *-2 getting out, and being rearrested *-2 an.###speakerb24.###yeah.###speakera25.###speakerb26.### isn't, isn't maryland where the famous willy horton case was *t*-1.###speakera27.###uh, i can't remember.###* refresh my memory.###speakerb28.### it was, uh, that was the one that *t*-1 was used *-2 so much in the campaign. in the politica-, in the presidential race.###uh, may, it may not have been maryland.###it may have been massachusetts,###i don't remember.###speakera29.###um, i don't remember myself.###speakerb30.###anyway, well the question is, you know, do you think, 0 i-, it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime or do you think 0 it can *?* if it's done *-1 right?###speakera31.
66366:13	well at least maybe the guy 0 they cross *t*-1 next time is going *-2 to *?*.	maybe	###i think 0 they've got over a hundred dead already this year.###speakerb42.###last year it was d c,###i guess 0 baltimore caught them.###speakera43.###well, it's kind of, it's kind of moved up###and you have *-1 to remember that it, it, it, uh, there's, i think, x number of people out there that *t*-2 are going *-3 to commit murders,###speakerb44.###uh-huh.###speakera45.###and, uh, once you kill off a few of them,###speakerb46.###yeah.###speakera47.###i mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that, i mean pretty soon you run out of people 0 * to murder *t*-1.###speakerb48.###yeah,###the only consolation is 0 so many of the murders are, you know, the, the violent people going against each other###and so they, you know,###society's not going *-1 to put them to death,
66518:30	well the thing 0 i'd be most likely *-1 to attach the death penalty to *t*-2 is the violence.	likely	###and that w-,### i, i've never been on a jury,###i've never had that experience,###i'm not sure 0 i'd look forward to *-1 making that kind of decision about a man's life.###speakera91.###yeah,###yeah,###well, it, it, it went pretty, pretty quick from what he said *t*-1.###speakerb92.###uh-huh.###speakera93.###but i mean there's, there's, there's a lot of other crimes out there, i mean besides murder,###i think, uh, 0 now if you're dealing drugs now, caught more than twice or something, uh, it, there's, uh, a death penalty associated * with it.###speakerb94.###uh-huh.###speakera95.###speakerb96.###yeah.###speakera97.###speakerb98.
66527:26	and the people 0 i'd most likely want *-1 to sentence *t*-2 to death are the people that *t*-3 just show a really low regard for human life.	likely	###uh-huh.###speakera93.###but i mean there's, there's, there's a lot of other crimes out there, i mean besides murder,###i think, uh, 0 now if you're dealing drugs now, caught more than twice or something, uh, it, there's, uh, a death penalty associated * with it.###speakerb94.###uh-huh.###speakera95.###speakerb96.###yeah.###speakera97.###speakerb98.###well the thing 0 i'd be most likely *-1 to attach the death penalty to *t*-2 is the violence.###i mean, ye-,###i can handle people, people selling drugs, you know,### it's, it's wrong,###but it, it's not worth somebody getting executed *-1 for *?*.###but we hear so much about the violence and how it *exp*-1's not safe * to walk the streets because somebody, you know, these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing.###speakera99.###uh-huh.###speakerb100.
66973:59	i, uh, ride bicycles,, uh, fifteen, twenty miles, i don't know, maybe three times, maybe four times a week.	maybe	###it only takes one time.###speakera131.###that's right.###speakerb132.###it *exp*-1's a hard lesson * to learn.###speakera133.###there's only one crazy out there, you know, * to make any difference.###speakerb134.###yeah,###yeah,###you know, it goes all over###well, you got the.###speakerb1.###uh, so what do you do *t*-2 *-1 to exercise?###speakera2.###uh, s-,###i, uh, weight train, uh, three days on and one day off.###speakerb3.###uh-huh.###speakera4.
66973:69	i, uh, ride bicycles,, uh, fifteen, twenty miles, i don't know, maybe three times, maybe four times a week.	maybe	###it only takes one time.###speakera131.###that's right.###speakerb132.###it *exp*-1's a hard lesson * to learn.###speakera133.###there's only one crazy out there, you know, * to make any difference.###speakerb134.###yeah,###yeah,###you know, it goes all over###well, you got the.###speakerb1.###uh, so what do you do *t*-2 *-1 to exercise?###speakera2.###uh, s-,###i, uh, weight train, uh, three days on and one day off.###speakerb3.###uh-huh.###speakera4.
67062:44	so i began a program couple, i don't know probably three or four weeks ago	probably	###speakerb25.###how about you,###what kind of biking do you do *t*-1?###speakera26.###uh, well, actually my wife just got me into it###and i did an, did an internship at the institute for aerobics research in dallas, the cooper clinic,###speakerb27.###uh-huh.###speakera28.###and i learned all the health benefits of, you know,###i was a solid weight trainer,###speakerb29.###uh-huh.###speakera30.###and all 0 i did *t*-1 was weights and aerobic exercise###and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need *-1 to do it,###so, once i got into this, uh, internship, i learned all the physiological ad-, advan-, advantages to it,###speakerb31.###uh-huh.###speakera32.
67151:15	i mean, maybe it's because of the winters. uh, or maybe just because, you know, there's, there's a lot more flat lands, you know, out in the west.	maybe	###um.###speakera58.###bicycling is really big here.###i didn't know that, and, you know, until i came down here, and, kind of caught the fever.###speakerb59.###wow.###speakera60.###speakerb61.###yeah.###speakera62.###because i lived in indiana all my life###and, you know, you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that, *t*-1 or above the age of fifteen or something,###speakerb63.###uh-huh.###speakera64.###but, other than that it's nothing up there like it is *?* down here.###speakerb65.###yeah,###i'm not sure why that is *t*-1.###i mean, generally in the midwest it seems *-1 to be less, much less.
67151:44	i mean, maybe it's because of the winters. uh, or maybe just because, you know, there's, there's a lot more flat lands, you know, out in the west.	maybe	###um.###speakera58.###bicycling is really big here.###i didn't know that, and, you know, until i came down here, and, kind of caught the fever.###speakerb59.###wow.###speakera60.###speakerb61.###yeah.###speakera62.###because i lived in indiana all my life###and, you know, you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that, *t*-1 or above the age of fifteen or something,###speakerb63.###uh-huh.###speakera64.###but, other than that it's nothing up there like it is *?* down here.###speakerb65.###yeah,###i'm not sure why that is *t*-1.###i mean, generally in the midwest it seems *-1 to be less, much less.
67216:30	i've, i've definitely noticed 0 it's had a good effect on my pulse rate, my resting pulse.	definitely	###no,###i haven't *?*,###no.###speakera84.###because it really, from what i understand *t*-1, it really improves your, uh, cholesterol###speakerb85.###um.###speakera86.###and, you know, it, uh, it kind of knocks down two of the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which *t*-1 is, uh, uh, low cardiovascular fitness, and also, uh, you know, the cholesterol.###speakerb87.###uh-huh.###speakera88.###it gives you increased h d ls and decreases your l d ls.###speakerb89.###oh, that's great.###speakera90.###yeah,###so...###speakerb91.###yeah,
67427:28	and i felt, felt probably worse for them than, than for me because, oh gosh they, the, uh, this fellow's wife who *t*-1 was, uh, watching the dog, pro-, she, i think 0 *t*-2 she loved that dog more than i did	probably	###and, uh, he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing###and then he got hit *-1 by a cadillac.###speakerb31.###oh no.###speakera32.###so, i couldn't believe it.### that was, that was really hard.###speakerb33.###oh, gee.###speakera34.###and that was even harder for,###i was on a business trip at the time###and the dog was being house sit *-1, or dog sit *-1, whatever, by some friends of mine down the street,###speakerb35.###uh-huh.###speakera36.###so they just felt absolutely awful.###speakerb37.###oh, i bet.###speakera38.
67597:21	and up here the water's probably about forty degrees right now.	probably	###he first jumped in###and i,### he's, he's just about a year old himself and never had really,###i don't think 0 he'd swum before.###speakerb91.###really.###speakera92.###but he jumped in, in the, the river.###speakerb93.###did puppy go to?###speakera94.###well the puppy jumped in the, into some of the pools but not into the,###i was careful *-1 to keep her away from the, the fast moving water,###speakerb95.###oh, that's good,###yeah.###speakera96.###'cause if she fell in then i'd of been, had *-1 to go in after her.###speakerb97.###speakera98.
67798:9	maybe, maybe if i went back and took a sociology class now they'd say 0 it is a deterrent.	maybe	###we seem *-1 to be degenerating here,###so.###speakerb161.###speakera1.###what's the, uh,### in texas law has a, uh, what does it have *t*-1, it has a death penalty doesn't it?###speakerb2.###oh, yes,###yeah.###they just, uh, started it again, too just late, or, within the past few years.###you know for quite some time, just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty.###speakera3.###but now it's coming back into favor.###speakerb4.###uh, yes.###well, they find 0 it is more deterrent.###speakera5.###well, my sociology class at s m u's taught us that it was not a deterrent.###uh, but now that's just what they said *t*-1.###uh, i don't know
67798:17	maybe, maybe if i went back and took a sociology class now they'd say 0 it is a deterrent.	maybe	###we seem *-1 to be degenerating here,###so.###speakerb161.###speakera1.###what's the, uh,### in texas law has a, uh, what does it have *t*-1, it has a death penalty doesn't it?###speakerb2.###oh, yes,###yeah.###they just, uh, started it again, too just late, or, within the past few years.###you know for quite some time, just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty.###speakera3.###but now it's coming back into favor.###speakerb4.###uh, yes.###well, they find 0 it is more deterrent.###speakera5.###well, my sociology class at s m u's taught us that it was not a deterrent.###uh, but now that's just what they said *t*-1.###uh, i don't know
67895:21	i think 0 i'd probably do it	probably	###* let's have it, put them all, give them all a shot, get rid *-1 of them.###speakera33.###well, well, i guess, though, 0 where i would have a problem with it if i were on the jury that, that, *t*-3 put, that *t*-1 handed down the death sentence because it *exp*-2 was my judgement 0 the person's guilty.###speakerb34.###why should they be sit-, sitting in, uh, prison getting their college degree *t*-1.###speakera35.###speakerb36.###uh-huh.###speakera37.###now that's tougher.###it *exp*-1's easier * to say it on the telephone and everyone agree that, yeah, the death penalty's the way 0 * to go *t*-2,###it's a deterrent to crime,###they shouldn't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway.###but * to be the actual one of the ones that *t*-1 decide, that would be tougher for me.###speakerb38.###yes,###very true.### i, uh, i agree with you there.###uh, uh-huh.###speakera39.
67932:15	but i want, maybe	maybe	###or rather than * have a warped mind it was just the only way 0 * to get whatever they wanted *t*-1 *t*-2.###speakerb44.###yeah###well, uh, uh-huh.###speakera45.###and they, they wanted something worse than they, more than they respect the human life.###speakerb46.###yeah,###exactly.###well, anyhow i guess 0 we both agree that, that it is, it should be in effect.###speakera47.###speakerb48.###speakera49.###* hang them.###speakerb50.###speakera51.###yeah,###i agree 0 it should be in effect.###also i agree 0 there should be a lot of care in the enforcement, uh,###so i guess 0 i would say 0 i want it to be in effect
67949:7	and maybe, now, i don't remember if this *ich*-3 is texas or not, that *t*-1 has something about 0 all drug dealers can be sentenced *-2 to the death sentence.	maybe	###i agree 0 it should be in effect.###also i agree 0 there should be a lot of care in the enforcement, uh,###so i guess 0 i would say 0 i want it to be in effect###but i want, maybe###well, i'd, i, now i have a problem with this, too.###i think 0 our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance.###speakerb52.###oh, that's true.###well now any, uh, just * believe 0 in just about any state in the union, uh, uh, a death, uh, or, uh, yeah, death verdict is an automatic, uh, appeal.###speakera53.###that's correct.###it is *?*,###it is *?*.###speakerb54.###and, uh, uh, yes,###i'm inclined *-1 to agree with you.###i think so,###there should be a limit as to the number of appeals.###speakera55.###now, there's some,
68001:33	i, i think 0 it certainly should be one of the options.	certainly	###speakera69.###is that how it's worded *-1 *t*-2?###i knew 0 it was there###but, i, i,### or p-, or is it proposed###or is it passed?###speakerb70.###i do believe 0 that's in.###uh, i wouldn't swear to it myself.###speakera71.###i believe 0 it is *?*,###speakerb72.###but i thought 0 it, i thought 0 it was in effect.###speakera73.###i believe 0 you're right, though.###i think 0 it is *?*.###and i have *-1 to agree with that.###speakerb74.###uh-huh.###speakera75.
68030:15	and the youngest is probably twenty-seven, twenty-eight.	probably	###speakera79.###but it just touches so many young people.###um.###well, my children are about in the same age bracket.###speakerb80.###oh, it does.###uh, i have four sons myself,###and the youngest is twenty-eight,###speakera81.###speakerb82.###so they are all pretty well grown up###and they all went through it, you know, * going through high school and everything###and * knock wood that, uh, they have not,###well i won't say 0 they didn't try it, uh,###i wouldn't know,###but, uh, they,###i doubt very much that they're, they're using it now.###in fact i'm sure 0 they don't.###speakera83.###i think, 0 * let's see, the oldest is thirty-two
68305:21	but, uh, more than likely the people that *t*-1 are on the, the jury know what they're doing *t*-2.	likely	###speakerb6.###uh, i don't, i don't even think that it should be unanimous either. uh,###speakera7.###well, what about the idea that one is only guilty, uh, when *-1 proven *-2 guilty beyond a reasonable doubt *t*-3?###i thought 0 that was the point of, uh, a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt.###speakerb8.###uh-huh.###speakera9.###speakerb10.###right.###speakera11.###but, if there are some people who *t*-1 don't agree uh, then there must be, it seems *-2 to be 0 there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people.###speakerb12.###exactly.###speakera13.###speakerb14.###uh-huh.###uh, i don't know.###i, uh,### you, you rarely hear, you hear, of course 0 there's cases where someone has been put *-1 in, in, in, uh, prison, uh, *-2 falsely accused *t*-3
68375:8	i definitely feel like we need *-1 to keep it at least unanimous because, uh, you know, there's the classic sort of * to kill a mockingbird kind of story where you get, you know, jury which *t*-2 can have all kinds of prejudices and things that, a judge at least officially isn't supposed *-3 to have *t*-4. though, of course they can *?*, too *t*-5.	definitely	###speakera29.###yeah,### i, i was called *-1 once,###but i was out of the country,###and apparently i, apparently they thought 0 i served###so i didn't, i didn't make any noise about it.###speakerb30.###speakera31.###i came back###and they said 0 the record showed 0 i served,###but i was out of the country at the time,###so i'm pretty sure 0 i didn't.###uh,###speakerb32.###yeah.### i, uh, i don't know,### i think 0 the, i guess 0 there's a lot of problems with the legal system.###speakera33.###yeah,###well, i, i, i don't know,
68474:28	i guess 0 it's just that maybe people are, you know, upset at court, you know.	maybe	###they're not looking for someone who *t*-1's going *-2 to be the most reasoned or sensible or rational juror.###neither side wants that.###they want *-1 to find a juror that *t*-2's going *-3 to, uh, be most persuadable by their arguments, you know.###speakerb60.###exactly.###speakera61.###uh, i wish 0 it were a little bit harder * to not serve on juries actually.###i mean, i know, 0 it, it, it's tricky because i know, you know, an awful lot of intelligent people who *t*-1 just, well i'm too busy *-1 to serve on a jury,###speakerb62.###uh-huh.###speakera63.###so i'll tell them that###and they won't, or just, you know, just answer one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that, you know,###speakerb64.###oh, yeah.###well,###speakera65.###they just say do you believe in such and such.###uh,###speakerb66.
68668:31	we're going *-1 to get down, probably down norfork sometime this summer, *-1 just to see why, catch a football game actually.	probably	###speakerb54.###uh-huh.###speakera55.###so, uh, where else did we go *t*-1, uh,###we've gone to richland, last year and, uh, had a good time, down there.###speakerb56.###oh, did you?###speakera57.###speakerb58.###did you go, to williamsburg,###speakera59.###speakerb60.###have you been down there?###speakera61.###uh, my girlfriend has *?* with her sisters###but i haven't been, down there.###speakerb62.###uh-huh.###speakera63.###uh, i hear 0 that's nice.
68734:26	and that's enough for, uh, probably another twenty years.	probably	###oh, okay,###i didn't know that.###yeah,###i think, uh, 0 they do the whole with, you know, * paying,###speakerb84.###yeah.###speakera85.###they really did throw away a lot of money *-1 to get, getting one thing or another,###speakerb86.###yeah.###speakera87.###but they had a good time###so.###speakerb88.###we really didn't do that really this time,###we just, uh, visited around.###speakera89.###uh, uh,###speakerb90.###we've done it a couple of times
68784:30	we've been *?* two or three times and probably go back again this winter.	probably	###but there was another, um, another amusement park down there, busch gradens, uh,###there was nobody there when we were there *t*-1,### we got, we won a log floating ride like five straight times,###we just get, get done with them###and they go, oh, do you want *-1 to go again,###speakerb100.###speakera101.###sure.###speakerb102.###have you ever,###you've never been down to epcot at florida and disney###speakera103.###no,###i'd like *-1 to *?*, sometime###speakerb104.###that's good,###speakera105.###but,###speakerb106.### we, we really enjoy that,
69011:21	i was thinking 0 i might be minor league	might	###speakera197.###or, uh,###speakerb198.###no,###uh-huh,###nope,###not too much into sports.###speakera199.###except our outside mumblex, though.###speakerb200.###just walking###that's all.###speakera201.###oh, i don't think 0 there are any,###* traveling that was in my early teens down in that area###and i'm know real sure 0 there are *?*, um,###speakerb202.###no professionals.###speakera203.###when, uh,
69087:27	i guess 0 if i did, maybe i would *?*	maybe	###speakera7.###um,###speakerb8.###speakera9.### and, and they did a full blood screen on me,###but they didn't call that a drug test.###so tha-,###i think 0 they checked for drugs.###they just don't tell you 0 they did.###speakerb10.###yeah.###speakera11.###speakerb12.### i had, i've had, uh, two or three drug tests that i had *-1 to get *t*-2 before i could start *-3 working at a job uh, different jobs.###speakera13.###uh-huh.###speakerb14.###i had one at t i and then one at another engineering company.###and, really, i mean, i don't mind them.###i don't do drugs anyway.
69096:13	but that would probably bother me *-4 to wake up one day and find out halfway through the day that you're going *-1 to be drug tested *-2 and you didn't know about it.	probably	###speakerb10.###yeah.###speakera11.###speakerb12.### i had, i've had, uh, two or three drug tests that i had *-1 to get *t*-2 before i could start *-3 working at a job uh, different jobs.###speakera13.###uh-huh.###speakerb14.###i had one at t i and then one at another engineering company.###and, really, i mean, i don't mind them.###i don't do drugs anyway.###i guess 0 if i did, maybe i would *?*###but, um, i don't know.###i know a girl that,###she's a nurse,###and they get drug tested *-1 randomly.###i've, never been randomly drug tested *-1.###speakera15.###uh-huh.###speakerb16.
69220:13	and that's probably the biggest problem 0 there is *t*-1.	probably	###i guess 0 it comes with the turf.###speakerb62.###yeah.###i guess so.###i guess 0 if you're going *-1 to do it you need *-2 to suffer the consequences.###speakera63.###yeah.###man.###and, in terms of drugs, they're illegal.###so you're, you're breaking the law anyway.###speakerb64.###that's true.###speakera65.###speakerb66.###that's true.###speakera67.###probably the, the biggest problem with those is 0 they don't do a real good job of, of *-1 assessing for alcohol.###speakerb68.###that's true.###speakera69.
69551:10	uh, maybe,	maybe	###it's a little *ich*-1 north of indianapolis, about an hour.###speakera61.###yeah,###yeah,###it's very pretty country in there i think 0 *t*-1,###it's gorgeous.###speakerb62.###uh-huh,###so.###speakera63.###well i,###uh, when is your next one, uh, scheduled now *t*-1.###speakerb64.###well it's like, the last one was my high school graduation###the next one was when i graduated from college *t*-1,###so i guess about two more years.###speakera65.###yes, well,###and do you think 0 you'll have a baby 0 * to take *t*-1 back with you.###speakerb66.
69558:4	probably.	probably	###uh-huh,###so.###speakera63.###well i,###uh, when is your next one, uh, scheduled now *t*-1.###speakerb64.###well it's like, the last one was my high school graduation###the next one was when i graduated from college *t*-1,###so i guess about two more years.###speakera65.###yes, well,###and do you think 0 you'll have a baby 0 * to take *t*-1 back with you.###speakerb66.###uh, maybe,###i don't know,###speakera67.###maybe.###speakerb68.###two more years,###i don't know,
69569:34	and ha-, then all of your family probably has not met your husband.	probably	###and do you think 0 you'll have a baby 0 * to take *t*-1 back with you.###speakerb66.###uh, maybe,###i don't know,###speakera67.###maybe.###speakerb68.###two more years,###i don't know,###probably.###speakera69.###i mean you need another milestone, you know.###speakerb70.###yeah,###i guess 0 that's, that's what,###i mean i've been married now for about nine months###so that was another milestone, i guess 0 *t*-1.###speakera71.###yes,###well i'm sure,
69623:37	well, um, i think 0 we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes.	probably	###are they getting all the data 0 they need *t*-1?###speakera85.###well, i don't know, uh,### i, i have a hard time getting, uh, people on the telephone.###speakerb86.###oh really.###speakera87.###uh-huh, * getting through to anybody.###sometimes i call off and on all day,###speakerb88.###huh.###speakera89.###but anyway, uh, i guess 0 we're supposed *-2 to be *-1 talking about family reunions aren't we *?*.###speakerb90.###speakera91.###but i got off that.###speakerb92.###well we've kind of exhausted everything i guess 0 *t*-1.###speakera93.###yes,
69637:7	and maybe i'll talk to you again.	maybe	###speakera91.###but i got off that.###speakerb92.###well we've kind of exhausted everything i guess 0 *t*-1.###speakera93.###yes,###well, um, i think 0 we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes.###speakerb94.###oh, okay.###speakera95.###and, uh, uh, we both look forward to * going to our next reunions, i'm sure 0 *t*-1.###speakerb96.###oh yeah.###speakera97.###but it *exp*-1 has been fun * talking to you.###speakerb98.###well you too.###speakera99.###* thank you.###speakerb100.
69860:64	and the water in medina lake and that area was really going down, that they were considering that they might have *-1 to do water rationing	might	###and there's a section in south dallas that *t*-1's had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain.###speakerb74.###uh-huh.###well, we could use some rain up here.###we're like in the bottom of the fourth year of drought, up here###speakera75.###really.###speakerb76.###and they had a pretty good early spring###and we got quite a bit of rain,###but it wasn't enough * to offset what they lost *t*-1 over the last four years.###speakera77.###uh-huh.###speakerb78.### and, uh, so they're still talking water rationing this summer,###so it would seem strange because in san antonio,###we had lived out, um, west of san antonio, in castroville,###speakera79.###uh-huh.###speakerb80.
70163:32	so that's, that's maybe not so typical,	maybe	###hopefully, eventually, we'll move in a larger home.###the only thing that i don't like *t*-1 also is 0 the rooms are so small.###you know, it *exp*-1's very difficult * to arrange furniture and things like that,###so.###are your rooms in your house bigger since it's a sixties home?###because it seems like then, that they built the homes *-1 much larger###is that true?###speakerb20.###yeah.###and they've got better closet space.###speakera21.###yeah.###speakerb22.###mumblex new houses that i've seen *t*-1.###speakera23.###yeah.###yeah.###that's really it.###that's a plus.###at least we do have like three walk-in closets here.
70188:21	i mean, i got probably the biggest,	probably	###yeah.###it really does, except when you have *-1 to fill them up *t*-2###and then you get those visa bills in.###and,###speakerb26.###yeah.###speakera27.###so anyway, um, anything else about the area, about, um,###you know, can you compare yourself to any thing around there.###speakerb28.###most of the neighborhood 0 i'm in *t*-1 is pretty typical.###this whole neighborhood was built *-1 between sixty and sixty-five.###speakera29.###yeah.###so it's, it's,###speakerb30.###everybody has got a mumblex, pretty good size yard,###speakera31.###yeah.###speakerb32.
70301:34	but, uh, since that's over with now, maybe i can, i can get this yard in shape.	maybe	###yeah.###speakerb58.###if i want *-1 to work in the flower beds,###speakera59.###yeah.###it sounds like you enjoy *-1 working outside as well.### i, i,###speakerb60.###very much.###speakera61.###yeah.###i really do enjoy that.###but i haven't planted anything yet###or, you know, i usually have gotten flowers coming out the gazoo,###but i, i haven't done that, yet.###i've had finals this week.###so, uh, you know, i'm just kind of trying * to, trying *-1 to stick in with that,###speakerb62.###huh-uh.###speakera63.
70354:11	you could probably do that.	probably	###speakera75.###that's true.###that's true.###my dad is a farmer###so, i've heard him talk about that forever.###i guess 0 it works,###but, um, you have *-1 to really wash your vegetables after that###so it won't make you sick.###* let's see###what else do you do *t*-1 to your house?###speakerb76.###well, i've done some rewiring on it.###speakera77.###yeah.###speakerb78.###eventually, if we stay here, i'm going *-1 to have *-2 to rewire the entire house.###speakera79.###oh, really.###do you plan on like *-1 adding any rooms or,###you have enough space
70357:39	i've talked about *-1 adding at least one more room and definitely adding another bath on.	definitely	###my dad is a farmer###so, i've heard him talk about that forever.###i guess 0 it works,###but, um, you have *-1 to really wash your vegetables after that###so it won't make you sick.###* let's see###what else do you do *t*-1 to your house?###speakerb76.###well, i've done some rewiring on it.###speakera77.###yeah.###speakerb78.###eventually, if we stay here, i'm going *-1 to have *-2 to rewire the entire house.###speakera79.###oh, really.###do you plan on like *-1 adding any rooms or,###you have enough space###you could probably do that.###or is it,###speakerb80.
70617:112	well, i found, uh, that, in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget *t*-6 was not where we were concerned *-5 *t*-2, but where maybe our friends *ich*-1 were concerned *-4 and our relatives and parents *t*-3.	maybe	###speakerb64.###and we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all,###but it seems like there's, um, times when we just have *-1 to get out *t*-3 where we'll go and like get a baby-sitter and we'll go and we'll blow, you know, fifty, sixty dollars in one night * going out *-2 to eat, going to a show or doing something *t*-4, you know.###speakera65.###well, i think 0 that's important for your budget * to be realis-,###for it to work though, you have *-1 to do something.###speakerb66.###yeah,###that's the hard part because when we sit down *-1 to make it *t*-2, we try *-3 to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put a certain amount in savings every week###and then it's not really that realistic###because we do find that we want *-1 to go and do something or splurge for, you know, birthday for somebody###or, you know, even we, we even do things real frugally for the kids,###we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they don't know the difference at this age, you know, whether they're jordache new or whether they're, you know, something###speakera67.###of course not.###speakerb68.###and they're both boys###so they just mumblex one year after the other in each other's clothes,###so. but, um, that's the hardest part for us is that it's really, um, you know, budgeting and some extra things, you know, for-, that *t*-1 are more, you know, nonessential items.###speakera69.
70750:32	well, i'm sure that, uh, probably every person in this country would agree with you on that. because everybody has a different idea of where the money should go *t*-1.	probably	###good luck###and * don't spend any money this weekend.###speakera113.###oh, i know###we'll have *-1 to stay home and mow the yard.###speakerb114.###oh, boy.###speakera115.###bye-bye.###speakerb116.###bye.###speakera1.###i pay a good deal of taxes i guess 0 *t*-1, because i, i make a fair amount of money,###and, uh, the taxes that i pay *t*-1, um, i guess 0 *t*-3 as a, as a general statement, i feel i, i guess 0 i get my money's worth for *t*-2.###speakerb2.###okay.###speakera3.###i'm not sure *ich*-1, though, whether i feel,###i guess 0 i am sure that i feel that, in general, though, uh, the allocation, uh, of the taxes in certain areas, i-, isn't correct.###speakerb4.
70774:251	why i, i'm, i'm a little concerned about *t*-2 today is that this, uh, rather, uh, quick and, and easy, i don't know, i shouldn't say easy, rather quick victory in the, in, in the, uh, mideast, uh, uh, over the, uh, iraqis, uh, might lead us into, uh, a false sense *ich*-1 of security that we can do that against any other foe.	might	###well, i, i,###lately, i guess, um, uh, or, at least for the last twenty years or so, i've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost, uh, defense items, at least in the last ten years, have been, uh,###there's been and extraordinary amount of money spent * there,###and i'm not really sure that, that we've gotten our money's worth there, uh, regardless of the outcome of the desert storm, uh, desert shield, uh, situations.###speakerb8.###uh-huh.###speakera9.###speakerb10.###yeah.###speakera11.###uh, i guess 0 my particular beef is that * having participated in the mi-, military off and on over the, over the years of *-2 being called *-1 back and things of that nature, is, uh, i've found that, you know, there's an extraordinary amount of waste.###i take that as a, as a given in any military operation###and###speakerb12.###oh yeah,###no argument here.###speakera13.###yeah,###and i gue-,### i, i should imagine that, that, that what the, what the problem,
71208:5	maybe this climate is a little better.	maybe	###uh-huh.###speakerb60.###but i like the vinca which *t*-1 is something 0 i hadn't,###they look sort of like impatiens,###you know, but they're not quite###and they're better for the sun areas.###um, and, of course, you know, the, mine are old theory ordinary flowers, marigolds and, and that sort of thing.###speakera61.###yes.###speakerb62.###in my,###speakera63.###do you have trouble with red spider on marigolds?###speakerb64.###no.###i don't.###speakera65.###maybe it's,###speakerb66.###i don't know,
71448:8	i probably couldn't do that because of my knee.	probably	### it's, uh, it's a new, uh, form i think 0 *t*-1,###uh, it's like low impact aerobics###but at, it...###speakera7.###oh, instead of *-1 hopping and jumping you just step###and...###oh, okay.###speakerb8.###uh-huh.###yeah,###speakera9.###speakerb10.### you, you have a step###and you literally step up on the step and move your arms,### it's, it's, it's, it's new,###speakera11.###huh.###speakerb12.###it's fun.###speakera13.
71582:38	and we had about, when i was there *t*-1, maybe thirteen hundred people.	maybe	###because i work some weird hours and do some traveling.###speakerb58.###uh-huh.###speakera59.###speakerb60.###no,###some, um,###i walk a lot because, uh, you know, *-1 being in, in school we,###speakera61.###yeah.###speakerb62.###i don't know if your campus was anything like ours,###but our parking lot's in one end of the, of the campus###and the school, the buildings are all at the other end,###so.###you ut-,###speakera63.###no,###i didn't have, well, much of a problem### we, mumblex i guess 0 i went to a small baptist school
71647:41	i'd be afraid,, afraid 0 i probably forgot how * to ride a bike *t*-1, you know.	probably	###what###just, because yo-, you don't like *-1 to *?* or because, because you won't be able *-2 to *?*.###speakerb80.### i'm,, i'm afraid 0 i won't be able *-1 to *?*.###speakera81.###oh, if you do, if you do aerobics you shouldn't have any problem *-1 running.###speakerb82.###i wish 0 i'd###speakera83.###speakerb84.###yeah.###i hope not. um,###speakera85.### we've, we ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough.###speakerb86.###uh-huh.###i don't even own a bike,###i think 0 the last time 0 i was on a bike *t*-1 when i was about twelve *t*-2,###so.###uh, i don't know,
71814:37	i'm, i guess 0 i probably put on about ten, nine or ten pounds, since i stopped *-2 playing, which *t*-1 was about four years ago.	probably	###but just i've never used those machines###i just use the regular machines and the free weights, you know, like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights.###speakera141.###yeah.###speakerb142.###just * to do, you know, some bicep, tricep exercises.###sit-ups, of course.###speakera143.###yeah,### that's, that's where i'm really starting *-1 to get noticeable *t*-2,###speakerb144.###uh-huh.###speakera145.###i'm just getting real soft in the middle.###speakerb146.###oh, yeah,###i think 0 that's, uh, number one problem with everyone.###speakera147.###uh-huh.###i haven't really started *-1 to put on a lot of weight
71967:67	but realistically that's, i'm, i'm realizing 0 that's probably not going *-1 to be possible, um, for middle-class people to be able *-2 to live just on one income.	probably	### they are, th-, they're all, um,### it's, and it's, i think 0 it's kind of a new movement###it's going back towards, you know,###women have come into the work force in the last twenty, thirty years###and now they're wanting *-1 to go back to the old days where, you know, women stayed home with the kids, you know, and try *-2 to give the kids quality time *t*-3.###speakera21.###uh-huh.###speakerb22.###and i, i think that in the future you're, i think 0 you're going *-1 to see a lot more, um, women choosing * to not work after they have a baby.###speakera23.###yeah.###speakerb24.###um, i think 0 with, uh, the, uh, the work force with the, the salaries that### a lot of, a lot of the women that i work for *t*-1 have husbands who *t*-2 are, um, vice-presidents of companies###and i think 0 with, uh, um, this, it seems like it's more the upper-class people,###speakera25.###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###um, i don't see it as much, the, like in my situation where i don't, i don't have children yet *t*-1,###but ideally i would like *-1 to be able *-2 to stay home with my kids.
72057:5	maybe that's contributed *-1 to a lot of the problems that we see *t*-2 all the time,	maybe	###uh-huh.###speakerb52.###i think 0 morally, um, it seems like there was, peo-, people were a lot better back then as far as hig-, higher standards.###speakera53.###true.###well, the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of * being the father figure###and with women working so much they're kind of pulled *-1 out of it too.###speakerb54.###yeah.###speakera55.###so, kids are raised *-1 around their friends and by the media.###speakerb56.###yeah,###that's true.###speakera57.###and that's, you know, that's contributed *-1,###speakerb58.###and i think, i think 0 you're going *-1 to see a lot more of that in the future.###speakera59.###yeah,
72123:105	i guess unless, unless there's a, a major swing in the change of what *t*-1's important to people, you know, probably keep * going downhill.	probably	###yeah.###speakera73.###you know, you create a bigger, bigger family, generation after generation but not really on purpose.###speakerb74.###yeah.###speakera75.###so. it's not, not a real functional situation anyway.###so, you know, i don't know 0 it's, i don't know that that trend's going *-1 to change the single parent type families###and the mumblex families, as long as we've got so many other crazy things going on in society.###speakerb76.###yeah,### i, i think that eventually the, the family unit's just not going *-1 to even exist anymore.###mumblex like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that i think 0 there's going *-1 to be more single parent families than there are, um, you know, two parent families.###speakera77.###uh-huh.###speakerb78.###that's pretty sad.###speakera79.###yeah,###it is *?*,
72356:5	maybe i have a problem.	maybe	###right.###see that's the other problem 0 i have *t*-1.###if i start into something and i really enjoy what i'm reading *t*-1, then i have a terrible time * getting away from it too.###speakera65.###uh-huh.###speakerb66.###i'll stay up until two or three o'clock in the morning, you know, because i'm so engrossed in it###and then before you know it, it's time 0 * to get up and go to work *t*-1.###you know, that type of thing.###speakera67.###yeah.###speakerb68.###that's why### i, i don't know### i'm, i'm kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that *t*-1.###even if i'm, uh, doing something like an afghan, if i'm close to the end, sometimes i'll, do the same thing.###speakera69.###uh-huh.###speakerb70.###i don't know what you would call it *t*-1,
72767:9	maybe not, maybe they're not really concerned about *-1 getting paid	maybe	###speakerb40.###uh-huh.###speakera41.###i guess for that very reason that, that, uh, if you're not real conscious of what you're doing *t*-1, it's just too much by the time 0 you get,###speakerb42.###uh-huh.###speakera43.###well, if you got a bunch of cards, you get a bunch of bills every month###speakerb44.###uh-huh.###speakera45.###and for some strange reason those people think 0 they need *-1 to get paid *-2.###speakerb46.###i know,###isn't that funny?###speakera47.###yeah.###speakerb48.###speakera49.###and i give them,
72767:19	maybe not, maybe they're not really concerned about *-1 getting paid	maybe	###speakerb40.###uh-huh.###speakera41.###i guess for that very reason that, that, uh, if you're not real conscious of what you're doing *t*-1, it's just too much by the time 0 you get,###speakerb42.###uh-huh.###speakera43.###well, if you got a bunch of cards, you get a bunch of bills every month###speakerb44.###uh-huh.###speakera45.###and for some strange reason those people think 0 they need *-1 to get paid *-2.###speakerb46.###i know,###isn't that funny?###speakera47.###yeah.###speakerb48.###speakera49.###and i give them,
72891:78	um, years ago, well, th-, i had my visa card through this bank in oklahoma city for, oh, probably fifteen years,	probably	###speakera101.###i don't want *-1 to have *-2 to mess with it.###you know you carry around a wallet full of credit cards,###speakerb102.###uh-huh.###speakera103.###and, uh, one of these days it's going *-1 to all be full.###speakerb104.###a girlfriend of mine found a,###it was a visa or mastercard,###she found an ad for one *ich*-1 in like a good hou-, housekeeping magazine for eleven percent.###speakera105.###oh, that's not bad.###speakerb106.###mumblex###shoot i need one of those.###speakera107.###yeah.###no,###if they don't say, no annual membership on them, i'll throw them away.
72999:13	well, we certainly found that to be true.	certainly	###i do have friends that *t*-1 have children,###yes.###speakerb4.###and what do they say *t*-1 about * finding adequate child care?###speakera5.###they,###speakerb6.###i think 0 that may be the key word.###speakera7.###i think 0 that's correct.###they're, uh, relatively nonexistent from, uh, from what i hear *t*-1 from my friends.###it seems like, uh, even when they have consulted day care centers that *t*-1 are quote unquote reputable, that *t*-2 are sort of like a chain, if i can use that word *t*-4 uh, still you have *-3 to deal with the people that, you know, *t*-5 happen *-6 to be operating it locally###speakerb8.###right.###speakera9.###and, uh, it's just a matter of, of trust, you know,###i think 0 they feel that these people are, um, under qualified basically and underpaid *-1,###and i think 0 that sort of goes hand in hand###so it's, it's difficult for them.###speakerb10.
73049:76	so, um, i can see where someone, you know, in a position like that, in a live-in capacity, would definitely be the way 0 * to go *t*-1 if you're, you're lucky enough *-3 to have the financial mumblex 0 * to be able *-2 to do that *t*-4 *t*-5.	definitely	###and that worked for a while,###but they were really, adequate ones were really tough 0 * to find *t*-1.###speakera27.###i'm sure 0 that's true.###speakerb28.###it takes that mixture of a very mature college student, who *t*-2 wants *-1 to do something and yet is willing *-1 to give the time, and the interest to the children.###speakera29.###huh-uh.###speakerb30.###speakera31.###right.###speakerb32.###speakera33.###right.###i do have a friend that, uh, uh,###she and her roommate became live-in care givers###and they loved it.###they had stayed with this family from the time 0 these children were small, you know, four or five years old *t*-1, up until they were well into grade school.###and, uh, she was paid *-1 very well because they, the parents trusted them###and they, you know, had done such a good job.
73085:13	well, it certainly is *?*. uh,	certainly	###speakerb40.###mumblex.###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###much as other cultures disagree *?*, our lives don't revolve around our children.###speakera43.###yeah.###yeah.###and that's, that's, that's bad 0 * to have *-2 to admit *t*-1, too,###but, uh, you know, it's just, 0 there's so much pressure when you're talking about two people that *t*-1 work outside the home *t*-2### and, and i think 0 that is one reason why i continue *-1 to be without children *t*-2.###i,###it's just such a responsibility### and, and when i've had friends that *t*-1 have said *t*-2,###when you hear people say, it, it alters your life forever *t*-1,###please * take heed,###well, i realize 0 that's true###so it's, uh, such a responsibility.###speakerb44.
73127:41	it's a matter *ich*-2 not necessarily, uh, that she *ich*-3 might want *-1 to stay home or he, as well,	might	###speakera55.###sure.###sure.###sure.###speakerb56.###there are those times when i think, gee, if i didn't have children i could be out *-1 playing bridge or golf *t*-2.###speakera57.###right.###right.###right.###right.###but, you know, it's funny.### i did, i had a friend that *t*-1 said, you know, before we always said 0 we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other###and she got older###and she said, but you know, we never do those things anyway.###so why, why am i waiting, you know *t*-1,### it's, it's just the way 0 your attitude changes *t*-1###and you mature i suppose 0 *t*-1.###but the thing about the child care i, you know, i have friends that *t*-1 struggle financially### and, and they both do have *-2 to work.
73176:18	i think 0 that might be part of the problem with some people. you know,	might	###huh-uh.###speakerb70.###they are not all things to all people or all children.###speakera71.###right.###speakerb72.###speakera73.###right.###right.###yeah.###speakerb74.###the ones that *t*-1 are good with babies tend *-2 not to be good with toddlers.###speakera75.###huh-uh.###speakerb76.###speakera77.###huh-uh.###i think 0 it takes a,###i don't know,###i think 0 your patient level must, needs *-1 to increase as the child gets older.
73247:60	i guess 0 you find out that you're a much stronger person than you thought *?*, maybe.	maybe	###right.###right.###speakerb98.###we are being cooperative,###what *t*-1's wrong with you?###speakera99.###right.###right.###speakerb100.###you don't understand this.###speakera101.###huh-uh.###speakerb102.###that's just the way 0 their minds work *t*-1.###and it's almost everyday.###speakera103.###that's amazing.###it *exp*-1's amazing that people actually,###the stamina that you must, you know, draw *t*-1 from yourself *-2 to deal with it.###it must be interesting.
73442:58	you know, uh, as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job 0 * to do *t*-1.	definitely	###speakerb16.###i lived in akron, ohio.###speakera17.###oh, did you?###i'm from mumblex, illinois,###so.###speakerb18.###oh.###speakera19.### how long, how long you been in dallas *t*-1?###speakerb20.###oh, about eight years.###speakera21.###oh, really?###speakerb22.###in fact in the eight years 0 i've been here *t*-1 it seems to me 0 it gets more and more, gets *-2 to be more and more restrictive place 0 * to live *t*-3. i think,###speakera23.###yeah, uh###speakerb24.###speakera25.
73451:7	and maybe that has a lot 0 * to do *t*-1 with it.	maybe	### how long, how long you been in dallas *t*-1?###speakerb20.###oh, about eight years.###speakera21.###oh, really?###speakerb22.###in fact in the eight years 0 i've been here *t*-1 it seems to me 0 it gets more and more, gets *-2 to be more and more restrictive place 0 * to live *t*-3. i think,###speakera23.###yeah, uh###speakerb24.###speakera25.###you know, uh, as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job 0 * to do *t*-1.###speakerb26.###yeah,###i think 0 it's,###crime has gone, got a lot worse in the last last ten, fifteen years,###speakera27.###oh, yeah,###i agree.###speakerb28.
73454:23	i, i definitely think 0 that has gotten a lot worse,	definitely	###speakera21.###oh, really?###speakerb22.###in fact in the eight years 0 i've been here *t*-1 it seems to me 0 it gets more and more, gets *-2 to be more and more restrictive place 0 * to live *t*-3. i think,###speakera23.###yeah, uh###speakerb24.###speakera25.###you know, uh, as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job 0 * to do *t*-1.###speakerb26.###yeah,###i think 0 it's,###crime has gone, got a lot worse in the last last ten, fifteen years,###speakera27.###oh, yeah,###i agree.###speakerb28.###and maybe that has a lot 0 * to do *t*-1 with it.###speakera29.###yeah,
73610:11	i've probably seen him around.	probably	###speakera81.###are you really *.###what floor?###speakerb82.###two.###speakera83.###i'm on the seventh floor.###speakerb84.###well,###speakera85.###how about that.###well, it's a small world.### so, so * let's see,###second floor, you work with, uh, linear.###speakerb86.###yeah.###speakera87.### do you. do you, uh, do you know alec morton?###speakerb88.###yeah,
73704:19	* catch them next year probably.	probably	###and he's from that area,###and, uh, he works over in the park, park central building i think 0 *t*-1###but, uh, i haven't talked to him in a while,###but, um, yeah,### he, he misses it.###he used *-1 to go back twice *rnr*-2 or three times *rnr*-2 a year, you know, because he missed it.###* sounds like you haven't been back there in a while.###speakerb114.###no,###i haven't been back in fi-, ten, fifteen years.###speakera115.###you still have relatives back there###or,###speakerb116.###yeah,###i do,###i just haven't had a chance * to get back.###speakera117.###oh.###speakerb118.
73717:16	well my kids are probably needing me to go	probably	###speakerb116.###yeah,###i do,###i just haven't had a chance * to get back.###speakera117.###oh.###speakerb118.###* catch them next year probably.###speakera119.###really.###well, * let's see,### how, how long are we supposed *-1 to talk here *t*-2?###speakerb120.###i don't know,###i think 0 we ran out of social, social changes 0 * to talk about *t*-1,###speakera121.###speakerb122.###so.###speakera123.###yeah,
73873:114	i think 0 the other thing is that, uh, we have taken some rather drastic turns in our, in our education and the way 0 we approach things *t*-1 as of maybe starting back when, when i'm number one, you know, and, uh, uh, uh, * worrying about self and not, uh, seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family *t*-2.	maybe	###yeah,###but, you know, it's, it is interesting,###uh, they're so many mor-,###they're different kind of dangers *ich*-2 that *t*-1 face young people now and social pressures,###uh, the pressures of drug is so much,###the prevalence is so much greater,###speakera45.###uh-huh.###speakerb46.### the, the kinds of diseases that you've got *t*-1 out the, uh, um,###speakera47.###uh-huh.###speakerb48.###i mean the consequences is###so much of what *t*-1's going on, is so much more serious then when we were younger *t*-2.###speakera49.###i think 0 that's true,###i think 0 that's true.###speakerb50.###speakera51.
73952:93	uh, you know, with farming being so mechanized, uh, people working on the family farm which *t*-1 was a traditional american way that becomes less and less likely,	likely	###speakera81.###no,###there's so much more, then that###it starts, *-1 very much deeper then that###speakerb82.###yeah.###speakera83.###i think that too.###i see some flickers of, of, uh, of good directions turning,###speakerb84.###no.###speakera85.###but whether they're soon enough and fast enough i don't know *t*-1,###it's just,###speakerb86.###of course, life is a lot more complicated too in ways,###um, the kinds of jobs that people need *-1 to be trained *, for *t*-2 now.###speakera87.###right.###speakerb88.
73986:8	it certainly is *?*.	certainly	###speakerb94.###speakera95.###and there's so much, so, so many people on the lower end of those who, who *t*-1 are going *-2 to be the, the drop outs and the, and the poor and the homeless and whatnot,###speakerb96.###and you worry when, you know these the sex and drugs on the young children and the unborn children,###speakera97.###speakerb98.###speakera99.###yeah,###that's just another,###speakerb100.###uh, in terms of what it's going *-1 to mean *t*-2 to a society, in the future it's a###speakera101.###yeah.###speakerb102.###some ways it's rather frightening,###speakera103.###it really is *?*### it's just, it just is almost overwhelming sometimes when you think, of, of the jobs that *t*-1 is out there *-2 to be done *-3, in order * to flip things back around *-6 the way 0 they needed *-4 to be *t*-5 *t*-7,###speakerb104.
74141:14	well i think probably that *t*-1 we've just about.	probably	###and yet, you know, we have *-1 to make that choice###i think 0 twenty, thirty years ago a lot of women, just didn't have *-1 to make that choice.###speakera159.###yeah.###speakerb160.###speakera161.###i think 0 that's right.### what was, what was your name *t*-1 again?###speakerb162.###well, i,###linda lee.###speakera163.###linda.###speakerb164.###uh-huh.###speakera165.###okay.###speakerb166.###and your name was *?*?###speakera167.
74163:8	i certainly do.	certainly	###well i enjoyed, *-1 talking with you.###speakera169.###i'm going *-1 to, change the world###speakerb170.###speakera171.###but, uh,###speakerb172.###well, i enjoyed *-1 talking with you.###speakera173.###yes,###it *exp*-1's nice * talking to you, too.###speakerb174.###okay.###speakera175.###bye now.###speakerb176.###bye-bye.###speakerb1.###well, kathleen, do you believe that there is a problem with our public school system?###speakera2.
74257:23	but i believe that there's definitely a basic perception and image problem with the fact of * even being a teacher.	definitely	###have you done anything like that?###anything political?###speakerb35.###well, my mother was on the school board. as we were coming up.###speakera36.###uh-huh.###speakerb37.###and, uh, that, basically, is the extent to which our, our family has been directly, you know,###they've always been involved.###my parents through the, the p t a organization.###and my mother was on the school board for eight years.###speakera38.###uh-huh.###speakerb39.###but, uh, that was, that's the extent of which i guess 0 that's more than, than some people, less than others.###speakera40.###that's more than a lot.###speakerb41.###i would, uh, tend *-1 to agree with you that there is a problem.###the methods of * correcting it i haven't thought through *t*-1 quite to the detail which you have *?* *t*-2.
74300:17	maybe not the four years definitely.	definitely	###so we'd have *-1 to have some way 0 * to, uh, reward and recognize the teachers who *t*-2 are doing a good job and give them a, a pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money *t*-3.###speakerb53.###speakera54.###speakerb55.###uh-huh.###speakera56.###speakerb57.### it, unfortunately, it's a, and it's a business or an occupation that the results are not as tangible as other ones *t*-1###speakera58.###uh-huh.###yeah.### it's, it *exp*-1's hard * to tell.###speakerb59.###so it's very, it *exp*-2's very difficult * to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one, other than i guess how, you kn-, how a person scores *t*-1 in the beginning before the class and then after the class.###you know, if there's some gauge that they could make *t*-1.###speakera60.###yeah.###speakerb61.###uh, also, i've alw-, i've thought around about the idea of * making teaching and the,###before you can get a certificate, you have a, a certain residency period. so much like a doctor.
74312:15	i thought that maybe something.	maybe	###speakerb59.###so it's very, it *exp*-2's very difficult * to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one, other than i guess how, you kn-, how a person scores *t*-1 in the beginning before the class and then after the class.###you know, if there's some gauge that they could make *t*-1.###speakera60.###yeah.###speakerb61.###uh, also, i've alw-, i've thought around about the idea of * making teaching and the,###before you can get a certificate, you have a, a certain residency period. so much like a doctor.###maybe not the four years definitely.###but some certain type of, of position where you're overseen *-1 *t*-2 * to begin with.###speakera62.###yeah.###now that's a very good suggestion.###speakerb63.###uh, just something 0 *t*-1 to, i-,###rather than * throw someone in, into that environment, uh, you know, it###speakera64.###yeah.### i don't think 0 student, i don't think 0 student teaching is enough.###speakerb65.
74315:67	at least what i used *-2 to observe *t*-3 in student teaching, was that some college kid who *t*-1 might not be all that bright * to begin with, was thrown *-7 into a class room with a teacher who *t*-4 was harried and overworked and, uh, had too many kids 0 * to handle *t*-5 and too many things 0 * to do *t*-6 and too many interruptions * to pay much attention to the student teacher.	might	###speakera60.###yeah.###speakerb61.###uh, also, i've alw-, i've thought around about the idea of * making teaching and the,###before you can get a certificate, you have a, a certain residency period. so much like a doctor.###maybe not the four years definitely.###but some certain type of, of position where you're overseen *-1 *t*-2 * to begin with.###speakera62.###yeah.###now that's a very good suggestion.###speakerb63.###uh, just something 0 *t*-1 to, i-,###rather than * throw someone in, into that environment, uh, you know, it###speakera64.###yeah.### i don't think 0 student, i don't think 0 student teaching is enough.###speakerb65.###i thought that maybe something.###speakera66.###i think that,
74397:13	well, * definitely is a national problem if, that they need *-1 to address *t*-2.	definitely	###and all 0 you had *-1 to do *t*-2 is * just get your share of those adopted * in the individual school districts.###speakerb95.###uh-huh.###speakera96.###speakerb97.###huh.###speakera98.###and, you know, a third of the texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks.###speakerb99.###sure.###sure.###speakera100.###and then the states that *t*-2 either don't adopt on a state wide basis or don't have as many kids, just have *-3 to follow along and take what texas gets *t*-1.###speakerb101.###right.###speakera102.###mumblex california is the biggest for elementary schools###but texas, uh, adopts state wide all the way through the twelfth grade.###speakerb103.###i see.
74404:17	and i hope 0 maybe we're going *-1 to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid *-2 to it with, uh, reagan's, uh, new education secretary and, uh, you know, trying * to do some, uh, trying *-3 to produce some new programs anyway.	maybe	###and, you know, a third of the texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks.###speakerb99.###sure.###sure.###speakera100.###and then the states that *t*-2 either don't adopt on a state wide basis or don't have as many kids, just have *-3 to follow along and take what texas gets *t*-1.###speakerb101.###right.###speakera102.###mumblex california is the biggest for elementary schools###but texas, uh, adopts state wide all the way through the twelfth grade.###speakerb103.###i see.###well, * definitely is a national problem if, that they need *-1 to address *t*-2.###speakera104.###yep.###* sure is *?*.###speakerb105.###* definitely is *?*.###speakera106.
74459:17	we kind of need maybe one more room.	maybe	###oh really,###what kind of square footage?###speakera7.###oh, i wouldn't know,###i measured it one time, because i was, uh, we had saw some termites###speakerb8.###uh.###speakera9.###and we thought about *-2 getting it sprayed *-1.###i think 0 it was like,###i can't remember,###i'm sorry###speakerb10.###that's okay,###that's okay.###speakera11.###it's big enough for us, though.###speakerb12.###uh-huh.###speakera13.
74765:19	your husband probably knows.	probably	###i mean, he, he well he said 0 he went up in the attic and looked around###and he was like, oh my god,###he says, * looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there.###and we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in *t*-1 because the roof was so sorry,###speakera113.###uh, * was a what,###speakerb114.###the roof was really sorry.###i mean when we moved in *t*-1, we had no idea how bad it was *t*-2.###speakera115.###uh-huh.###speakerb116.###it was a wood shingle roof,###and we,###the first year 0 we were living there *t*-1, we had *-2 to replace the roof.###speakera117.###well he put,###which###i heard 0 it *exp*-1's a law that you're only allowed *-2 to have three layers of shingles.###is it three or five,
74767:8	he probably knows,	probably	###he says, * looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there.###and we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in *t*-1 because the roof was so sorry,###speakera113.###uh, * was a what,###speakerb114.###the roof was really sorry.###i mean when we moved in *t*-1, we had no idea how bad it was *t*-2.###speakera115.###uh-huh.###speakerb116.###it was a wood shingle roof,###and we,###the first year 0 we were living there *t*-1, we had *-2 to replace the roof.###speakera117.###well he put,###which###i heard 0 it *exp*-1's a law that you're only allowed *-2 to have three layers of shingles.###is it three or five,### your husband probably knows.###speakerb118.
74861:8	you might as well *?*	might	###oh.###speakera141.###the fire alarm went off for some reason.###it shorted it out, or something.###speakerb142.###oh, yeah,###that will happen.###speakera143.###so she woke up with about six feet of water in her house.###speakerb144.###oh, my lord.###speakera145.###no,###not six feet###but,###speakerb146.###but it's quite a bit, quite a bit,###you know that,###speakera147.###yeah
74947:119	and, i can very clearly remember 0 ten years ago i was just beginning *-1 to explore *-2 computerizing my office and, and trying *-1 to find out what kinds of computers *t*-3 might be useful	might	###so we,###speakera169.###you all did it yourselves?###speakerb170.###what, uh, the walk?###speakera171.###the home improvements.###speakerb172.###oh yeah,###yeah,###he see he does this for a living,###speakera173.###uh-huh.###speakerb174.###i mean this is what,###speakera1.###it seems to me that one of the biggest differences is the computer revolution.###speakerb2.###yeah.###speakera3.
74963:111	i, i've seen that just in the last, uh, even five years *ich*-2 how much they've in-, uh, increased in use *t*-1. or probably eight years,	probably	###it seems to me that one of the biggest differences is the computer revolution.###speakerb2.###yeah.###speakera3.###and, i can very clearly remember 0 ten years ago i was just beginning *-1 to explore *-2 computerizing my office and, and trying *-1 to find out what kinds of computers *t*-3 might be useful###and we did end up with, uh, i b m, p c --s, which i now would not have chosen *t*-1,###speakerb4.###really?###speakera5.###but that was before the macintosh.###speakerb6.###yeah.###speakera7.###and twenty years ago i was, uh, in graduate school *-1 pecking out a dissertation on a manual typewriter.###speakerb8.###oh, i know it.###speakera9.###so i would say 0 that's one of the largest changes in, at least in my life.###speakerb10.###yeah,
74992:12	well, very possibly.	possibly	###speakerb14.###speakera15.###right.###speakerb16.###and, uh,###speakera17.###yeah,###thirty years ago i, i had a college job, uh, *-1 working as a programmer###and we had *-1 to write code in binary and, uh, have it punched *-2 in on those little cardboard cards which, i don't think 0 *t*-3 exists anymore.###speakerb18.###i know.###speakera19.###speakerb20.###no.###speakera21.###you never see one of those punch cards anymore.###speakerb22.###uh, i think 0 t v has a lot 0 *t*-1 to do with the changes, too. don't you?###in, like, people's attitudes.###speakera23.
74994:10	uh, certainly in the last thirty i would say 0 *t*-1 there have been significant changes. even, even the change from black and white to color television.	certainly	###right.###speakerb16.###and, uh,###speakera17.###yeah,###thirty years ago i, i had a college job, uh, *-1 working as a programmer###and we had *-1 to write code in binary and, uh, have it punched *-2 in on those little cardboard cards which, i don't think 0 *t*-3 exists anymore.###speakerb18.###i know.###speakera19.###speakerb20.###no.###speakera21.###you never see one of those punch cards anymore.###speakerb22.###uh, i think 0 t v has a lot 0 *t*-1 to do with the changes, too. don't you?###in, like, people's attitudes.###speakera23.###well, very possibly.###uh, i'm not sure 0 in the last ten years it's been very different from before.
75061:11	that's certainly, a difference.	certainly	###uh-huh.###so, what was our question about *t*-1,###decline in socio-,###speakera41.###* wasn't the decline so much.###i think 0 they just said the changes in, uh, social, social changes in the united states.###speakerb42.###yeah.###speakera43.###how was life different ten, twenty, or thirty years ago *t*-1.###so,###speakerb44.###well, i can't really remember back that far,###but ten years ago, uh, i don't know. i'd say, like *rnr*-1 in the nineteen seventies you remember how *t*-2 kids would walk around with a m, what do you call those *t*-3, little a m radios *t*-4###speakera45.###yes.###speakerb46.###and now people have jam box with c d players in them, you know. and, hand held t v --s and car phones.###speakera47.###yes.
75155:79	you think 0 that's caused a lot of pressure *ich*-1 on, like younger kids today, * to make choices that they probably shouldn't have *-2 to make *t*-3?	probably	###oh, wow.###speakera77.###speakerb78.###uh-huh.###speakera79.###uh, but i went *-1 to work as an editor and writer,###so, uh, uh, the, ten years ago i was working in the medical center, uh, *-1 publishing a journal and writing about medical topics.###speakerb80.###yeah.###speakera81.###and, * let's see,###twenty years ago, i guess 0 we're were just beginning *-1 to get into what they were calling *t*-2 the, uh, the sex revolution where, uh after the pill###speakerb82.###yeah.###speakera83.###and, uh, uh, * freed people up from worries about, uh, illegitimate pregnancy###and, i guess 0 in the seventies is the, the time when that was supposed *-1 to have exploded *t*-2.###thirty years ago there was no pill.###speakerb84.###uh-huh.
75173:57	in my day, we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected 0 *t*-1 might be, sleeping with their boyfriends.	might	###speakerb84.###uh-huh.###you think 0 that's caused a lot of pressure *ich*-1 on, like younger kids today, * to make choices that they probably shouldn't have *-2 to make *t*-3?###speakera85.###yes.###speakerb86.###speakera87.###i do.###i really do.###i have, uh, four kids in college right now, children and stepchildren###speakerb88.###yeah.###speakera89.###and i know that the expectation for them was, uh, * to have sex and, much earlier, than the expectation when i was in college *t*-1.###speakerb90.###uh-huh.###speakera91.###speakerb92.###yeah.###speakera93.
75180:12	but, they certainly didn't expect everybody to *?*	certainly	###i do.###i really do.###i have, uh, four kids in college right now, children and stepchildren###speakerb88.###yeah.###speakera89.###and i know that the expectation for them was, uh, * to have sex and, much earlier, than the expectation when i was in college *t*-1.###speakerb90.###uh-huh.###speakera91.###speakerb92.###yeah.###speakera93.###in my day, we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected 0 *t*-1 might be, sleeping with their boyfriends.###speakerb94.###yeah.###speakera95.###speakerb96.###yeah.###speakera97.
75185:10	and i certainly know from *-1 talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays.	certainly	###speakera89.###and i know that the expectation for them was, uh, * to have sex and, much earlier, than the expectation when i was in college *t*-1.###speakerb90.###uh-huh.###speakera91.###speakerb92.###yeah.###speakera93.###in my day, we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected 0 *t*-1 might be, sleeping with their boyfriends.###speakerb94.###yeah.###speakera95.###speakerb96.###yeah.###speakera97.###but, they certainly didn't expect everybody to *?*###and it was really only, uh, acceptable if you were engaged and planning *-1 to get married *-2 in, in the relatively near future.###speakerb98.###uh-huh.###speakera99.
75198:8	i certainly wouldn't have been able *-1 to twenty years ago tell you what, uh, my kids were likely *-2 to be like *t*-3.	certainly	###yeah.###speakera97.###but, they certainly didn't expect everybody to *?*###and it was really only, uh, acceptable if you were engaged and planning *-1 to get married *-2 in, in the relatively near future.###speakerb98.###uh-huh.###speakera99.###and i certainly know from *-1 talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays.###speakerb100.###oh, yeah.###it's kind of scary when i think of what *t*-2 will happen in twenty years, you know, when i have kids and they're grown *t*-3 and, uh, just kind of some of the changes that *t*-1 will happen even more *t*-4###so.###speakera101.###and i guess 0 the answer, is, is, * stay flexible because nobody can predict what *t*-1's going *-2 to happen in twenty years.###speakerb102.###* seems like it can't get much worse.###speakera103.###speakerb104.###yeah.###speakera105.
75198:66	i certainly wouldn't have been able *-1 to twenty years ago tell you what, uh, my kids were likely *-2 to be like *t*-3.	likely	###yeah.###speakera97.###but, they certainly didn't expect everybody to *?*###and it was really only, uh, acceptable if you were engaged and planning *-1 to get married *-2 in, in the relatively near future.###speakerb98.###uh-huh.###speakera99.###and i certainly know from *-1 talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays.###speakerb100.###oh, yeah.###it's kind of scary when i think of what *t*-2 will happen in twenty years, you know, when i have kids and they're grown *t*-3 and, uh, just kind of some of the changes that *t*-1 will happen even more *t*-4###so.###speakera101.###and i guess 0 the answer, is, is, * stay flexible because nobody can predict what *t*-1's going *-2 to happen in twenty years.###speakerb102.###* seems like it can't get much worse.###speakera103.###speakerb104.###yeah.###speakera105.
75267:10	uh, probably the biggest thing 0 we've got *t*-1 going now is the robberies	probably	###uh, i was almost thirty before i got off this continent.###speakerb126.###yeah.###speakera127.###and, uh, both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school *t*-1.###speakerb128.###yeah.###i know 0 that's what, uh, what my family was talking *t*-1 when i picked up and moved to texas from indiana *t*-2###and they were like, well, you know, twen-, thirty years ago we wouldn't have done that, you know.###speakera129.###uh-huh.###speakerb130.###and, uh, especially * come home every couple months.###speakera131.###yeah.###speakerb132.###you know, and,###speakera1.###okay.###uh, far as, you know, crime in the cities, i'm sure, 0 like in yours it's pretty, pretty bad.
75268:13	and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have *t*-1.	probably	###speakerb126.###yeah.###speakera127.###and, uh, both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school *t*-1.###speakerb128.###yeah.###i know 0 that's what, uh, what my family was talking *t*-1 when i picked up and moved to texas from indiana *t*-2###and they were like, well, you know, twen-, thirty years ago we wouldn't have done that, you know.###speakera129.###uh-huh.###speakerb130.###and, uh, especially * come home every couple months.###speakera131.###yeah.###speakerb132.###you know, and,###speakera1.###okay.###uh, far as, you know, crime in the cities, i'm sure, 0 like in yours it's pretty, pretty bad.###uh, probably the biggest thing 0 we've got *t*-1 going now is the robberies
75275:13	but i'd probably say 0 that's roughly right.	probably	###and they were like, well, you know, twen-, thirty years ago we wouldn't have done that, you know.###speakera129.###uh-huh.###speakerb130.###and, uh, especially * come home every couple months.###speakera131.###yeah.###speakerb132.###you know, and,###speakera1.###okay.###uh, far as, you know, crime in the cities, i'm sure, 0 like in yours it's pretty, pretty bad.###uh, probably the biggest thing 0 we've got *t*-1 going now is the robberies###and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have *t*-1.###speakerb2.###uh-huh.###speakera3.###how about you?###speakerb4.###uh, well, i don't actually live in the city,
75277:79	but i, i think 0 with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff i'd say 0 probably the police department would claim 0 the number one crimes, crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution, uh, and sale of drugs.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakerb130.###and, uh, especially * come home every couple months.###speakera131.###yeah.###speakerb132.###you know, and,###speakera1.###okay.###uh, far as, you know, crime in the cities, i'm sure, 0 like in yours it's pretty, pretty bad.###uh, probably the biggest thing 0 we've got *t*-1 going now is the robberies###and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have *t*-1.###speakerb2.###uh-huh.###speakera3.###how about you?###speakerb4.###uh, well, i don't actually live in the city,###but i'd probably say 0 that's roughly right.###i mean crimes against property seem *-1 to outnumber crimes against life,
75277:125	but i, i think 0 with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff i'd say 0 probably the police department would claim 0 the number one crimes, crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution, uh, and sale of drugs.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakerb130.###and, uh, especially * come home every couple months.###speakera131.###yeah.###speakerb132.###you know, and,###speakera1.###okay.###uh, far as, you know, crime in the cities, i'm sure, 0 like in yours it's pretty, pretty bad.###uh, probably the biggest thing 0 we've got *t*-1 going now is the robberies###and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have *t*-1.###speakerb2.###uh-huh.###speakera3.###how about you?###speakerb4.###uh, well, i don't actually live in the city,###but i'd probably say 0 that's roughly right.###i mean crimes against property seem *-1 to outnumber crimes against life,
75280:17	prob-, probably right, if you look at it from that stand point.	probably	###speakera131.###yeah.###speakerb132.###you know, and,###speakera1.###okay.###uh, far as, you know, crime in the cities, i'm sure, 0 like in yours it's pretty, pretty bad.###uh, probably the biggest thing 0 we've got *t*-1 going now is the robberies###and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have *t*-1.###speakerb2.###uh-huh.###speakera3.###how about you?###speakerb4.###uh, well, i don't actually live in the city,###but i'd probably say 0 that's roughly right.###i mean crimes against property seem *-1 to outnumber crimes against life,###but i, i think 0 with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff i'd say 0 probably the police department would claim 0 the number one crimes, crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution, uh, and sale of drugs.###speakera5.###uh-huh.
75316:33	our major crimes in our immediate town, uh, is probably robberies, house robberies	probably	###yeah.###speakera11.###how far out from the city, i mean, do you,###speakerb12.###i'm about fifteen miles out.###speakera13.###about fifteen miles.###i live in a little suburb, uh, which *t*-1 is, i guess 0 *t*-2 from dallas is twelve miles or so###speakerb14.###uh-huh.###speakera15.###but it's pretty congested.###we are considered *-1 in the country,###speakerb16.###um.###speakera17.###but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country.###speakerb18.###um.###speakera19.
75345:59	uh, i would say 0 the majority of it's happening during the day, uh, between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon.	probably	###but, uh, right now our neighborhood is running about, uh, eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed *-1, sometime during their, their, uh, existence in that neighborhood.###speakerb24.###wow.###speakera25.###speakerb26.###that's huge.###speakera27.###and since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or, you know, uh, burglar alarms uh, and including the out, uh, the outer perimeter type, uh, devices, sensors and things like that.###speakerb28.###uh-huh.###speakera29.###speakerb30.###uh-huh.###speakera31.###it's cut back, you know, considerably,###but it, it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood,###so it still, uh, remains city wide, pretty, pretty high.###speakerb32.### are there, are there any theories on why this is happening *t*-1?###speakera33.
75363:38	uh, so, uh, i would say 0 that's probably their prime motivation.	probably	### are there, are there any theories on why this is happening *t*-1?###speakera33.###uh, i would say 0 the majority of it's happening during the day, uh, between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon.###speakerb34.###uh-huh.###speakera35.###most,###speakerb36.###but why?###why is it happening *t*-1?###speakera37.###well, most families, most families are young###and both people are working.###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###speakera39.###so they're happening during the hours 0 they're gone from work *t*-1.###speakerb40.###uh-huh.###speakera41.
75390:28	i think 0 they could, uh, definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use *t*-1.	definitely	###um.###speakera45.###uh, you get a few of them that *t*-1 are a little bit sloppier, uh, *-2 just taking, uh, you know, just junk items that they, they can just get, you know, ten to twenty bucks for *t*-3 real quick.###speakerb46.###uh-huh.###speakera47.###probably the biggest items that, uh, that you get *t*-1 in our neighborhood, or, would be the high classed automobiles,###the, you know, mercedes, volvos, things that they can get, you know, big dollars for *t*-1 and the jewelry are the major targets,###speakerb48.###uh-huh.###speakera49.###guns, that sort of stuff.###speakerb50.###um.###speakera51.###very few, you know, penny, penny ante stuff.###speakerb52.###well, what do you think 0 *t*-1 can be done *-2 * to reduce that sort of crime?###speakera53.###well, uh, the police force, for one,
75424:23	that would be, certainly be a deterrent.	certainly	###speakerb60.###but, i mean, that's going *-1 to tend *-2 to,###i mean it seems to me 0 that sort of approach will tend *-1 to simply make the cost of * committing the crime slightly higher,###in other words, you've increased the probability of somebody being caught *-1 a little bit.###the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place *t*-1.###speakera61.###well, the,###course in our particular state, uh, we have the prison overcrowding, whatever,###so they're giving the early release, uh,###speakerb62.###right.###they're doing that in our state, too.###speakera63.###yeah,### and, and it's,###i think 0 what they need *-1 to do *t*-2 is * stop *-3 building more jails and start *-3 giving stiffer sentences, uh,###but for the,###speakerb64.###so you think 0 that would be a deterrent?###speakera65.
75492:16	well, you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something, right, and try *-1 to get money from him	probably	###uh-huh.###speakera89.###speakerb90.###right.###speakera91.###speakerb92.###wow.###speakera93.###and, you know, he was out within two months because of the parole system.###so what, what,###speakerb94.### did you, did you sue him under the civil system?###speakera95.###do what now?###speakerb96.###did you sue him under the civil system?###speakera97.### n-, no.###i'm not real familiar with that.###speakerb98.
75594:61	and that, that's a deterrent, too. if you think 0 the home owner might be armed, right, and awake	might	###right.###speakera131.###course it doesn't always work out in their favor.###speakerb132.###right.###speakera133.###but, uh, nevertheless, i think 0 people are just getting fed up and saying, you know, you can't arrest all of us,###speakerb134.###uh-huh.###speakera135.### you can, you know, you can get some of us,###speakerb136.###right.###speakera137.###you can't get all of us.###speakerb138.###uh-huh.###speakera139.###uh, and we're beginning *-1 to see more and more of that.###speakerb140.
75602:38	that's, i mean that's certainly a possibility in, in,	certainly	###uh-huh.###speakera135.### you can, you know, you can get some of us,###speakerb136.###right.###speakera137.###you can't get all of us.###speakerb138.###uh-huh.###speakera139.###uh, and we're beginning *-1 to see more and more of that.###speakerb140.###and that, that's a deterrent, too. if you think 0 the home owner might be armed, right, and awake###speakera141.###yeah.###speakerb142.###here you break in,###and you're going *-1 to get shot *-2.###speakera143.###yeah,
75616:25	uh, i would say 0 probably eighty percent of them that *t*-1 are caught *-2, they're from places like up in oklahoma, and louisiana, arkansas, you know, across the, the border.	probably	###yeah.###speakerb142.###here you break in,###and you're going *-1 to get shot *-2.###speakera143.###yeah,### that's, i mean that's certainly a possibility in, in,###we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in, you know, during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot *-1 to death *t*-2.###speakerb144.###uh-huh.###speakera145.###and, uh, it helps for a while###speakerb146.###uh-huh.###speakera147.###but then just another different set of people come in,###and most of the people are transients from out, outside of the state.###speakerb148.###huh.###speakera149.
75712:16	and, as you probably heard from the, in the dallas and texas area period the housing market is just unreal.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakera15.###but it *exp*-4 must be interesting now * trying *-1 to do something to a basic ranch, style home. uh, after *-2 having a one that *t*-3 was historical looking.###speakerb16.###it is *?*.###speakera17.###speakerb18.###it is *?*.###speakera19.###speakerb20.###yeah.###speakera21.###speakerb22.### that's, that's true.###when, uh, i met my husband *t*-1, he was living in an apartment at the time### and, and, uh, the town that i was living in *t*-1 only about eighty miles from here.###so, uh, you know, i, we,###really it was just###the market was so good,###we hadn't really planned on *-1 buying
75726:10	well, maybe you can, uh, make that one charming and, and make a little bit money, uh,	maybe	###when, uh, i met my husband *t*-1, he was living in an apartment at the time### and, and, uh, the town that i was living in *t*-1 only about eighty miles from here.###so, uh, you know, i, we,###really it was just###the market was so good,###we hadn't really planned on *-1 buying###and, as you probably heard from the, in the dallas and texas area period the housing market is just unreal.###i mean you can get things for such a song.###speakera23.###yes.###speakerb24.###so, that's, that's really why we ended up in a house like this *t*-1.###this is not what we, you know, what we want *-1 to stay in *t*-2 forever, because i have *-3 to have my, i've found that after *-4 doing this other house, i have *-5 to have my hands into stuff###and, you know, i'm always just wanting *-1 to paint and, and wallpaper and redo and redo,###speakera25.###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###so, uh, you know, i, i'm ready *-1 to get ahold of another one that i can have a little more input into *t*-2###so,###speakera27.
75796:41	for instance, one thing that i did *t*-1 that *t*-2 might even be a good suggestion for you uh, was something 0 i did *t*-3 on the outside.	might	###i spent almost three years *-1 redoing.###speakerb52.###oh, yeah.###speakera53.###and i considered it a full time job###speakerb54.###oh, it is *?*,###yeah.###speakera55.###and when we did, uh,###we kind of had planned this, uh, trek to the east, because we're both originally from this part of the country.###speakerb56.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera57.###speakerb58.###i see,###uh-huh.###speakera59.###and so, i think 0 some of the things that i did *t*-1 paid off.
75986:11	that's probably, because they had, you know	probably	###speakerb140.###yeah.###speakera141.###speakerb142.###i see.###speakera143.###because when you start *t*-1###and we put them on a base of four inches of s-, sand###speakerb144.###okay,###yeah.###speakera145.###and then we, uh, we swept sand in between,### but but it *exp*-1 was an error * to, to leave like an eighth of an inch or whatever.###speakerb146.###uh-huh.###speakera147.###you just put them together as close as you can *?*.###speakerb148.###as tight as you can *?*.
76012:86	if they have problems with, uh, sand bugs of some kind i think 0 *t*-3 all 0 they need *t*-1 to do *t*-4 is probably *-2 put some insecticide down in there on a, oh, a fairly regular basis, for a while anyway.	probably	###speakerb150.###but, uh, they just, they just haven't brought themselves to do it.###speakera151.###yeah,###well,###speakerb152.###so,###speakera153.###and i also used a rubber hammer, a lot, *-1 to, uh, you know,###speakerb154.###uh-huh.###speakera155.###speakerb156.###uh-huh.###speakera157.###if it wasn't quite level or something, i'd just get that, rubber hammer and, uh, and, and prob-, you know,###speakerb158.###right.###speakera159.###i think that they could,
76077:13	it might, it might do it,	might	###i think 0 in this area or most all areas they use, you know, for ticks and fleas.###speakerb180.###yeah.###speakera181.###and you know, they're, awful hard 0 * to do anything with *t*-1.###speakerb182.###right.###speakera183.###speakerb184.###oh, that's true.###that's true.###but my, my dad farms###and, you know, she's always telling him, isn't there something that, that you can bring *t*-1 home with you that *t*-2 kills everything that you spray *t*-3, you know, out in the, out in the field, that you can get rid *-5 of, these bugs,###speakera185.###yeah.###speakerb186.###but, uh,###speakera187.###i bet 0 dursban would do it.###speakerb188.
76077:24	it might, it might do it,	might	###i think 0 in this area or most all areas they use, you know, for ticks and fleas.###speakerb180.###yeah.###speakera181.###and you know, they're, awful hard 0 * to do anything with *t*-1.###speakerb182.###right.###speakera183.###speakerb184.###oh, that's true.###that's true.###but my, my dad farms###and, you know, she's always telling him, isn't there something that, that you can bring *t*-1 home with you that *t*-2 kills everything that you spray *t*-3, you know, out in the, out in the field, that you can get rid *-5 of, these bugs,###speakera185.###yeah.###speakerb186.###but, uh,###speakera187.###i bet 0 dursban would do it.###speakerb188.
76083:25	i think, uh, 0 you probably just need *-1 to make * sure that it dries, very, very careful-, uh, well, before she lets her cats out, or something, like that.	probably	###right.###speakera183.###speakerb184.###oh, that's true.###that's true.###but my, my dad farms###and, you know, she's always telling him, isn't there something that, that you can bring *t*-1 home with you that *t*-2 kills everything that you spray *t*-3, you know, out in the, out in the field, that you can get rid *-5 of, these bugs,###speakera185.###yeah.###speakerb186.###but, uh,###speakera187.###i bet 0 dursban would do it.###speakerb188.### it might, it might do it,###yeah.### she's got so many flow-, she's got just a gorgeous yard, so many, uh, flowers and her, her four cats, you know,###so she's sort of, uh, real funny about what she sprays *t*-1.###speakera189.###yeah.
76103:44	of everything that i did *t*-1, i guess 0 i enjoyed probably *-2 wallpapering the most	probably	###i think, uh, 0 you probably just need *-1 to make * sure that it dries, very, very careful-, uh, well, before she lets her cats out, or something, like that.###speakerb190.###uh-huh.###speakera191.###speakerb192.###uh-huh.###speakera193.###speakerb194.###yeah.###speakera195.###speakerb196.###yeah.###speakera197.###well, gosh, deb, we could talk all day couldn't we *?*.###speakerb198.###i know,### i, i was just, you know, it just seems### like i, as i said when i heard the, what the subject was *t*-1 *t*-2, i thought oh, gosh i haven't thought about, uh, what i went through *t*-3 at that other house in so long.###i've been so busy.###but, uh, i don't know
76145:63	they seem *-1 to be burdening the school system more and more with problems, any problems that a child might have *t*-2, whether it's actually a school related thing or not	might	###uh-huh.###speakerb208.###speakera209.###yes.###speakerb210.###and she has that up in her attic###and i have sworn that it,###i'm going *-1 to find a house 0 *-2 to put that door on *t*-3 before she does.###speakera211.###speakerb212.###so, as far as * looking toward the future, you know, that's my plan.###i'm going *-1 to have *-2 to move fast, i think, though, because, uh, you know, as a,###speakera213.###speakerb214.###speakera1.###do you have any particular thoughts about the school system?###speakerb2.###well, um, i, i think that in, in, uh,###recently with the,###i'm not sure if it's more a problem with american families or a problem with the school system.
76158:64	it's gotten way beyond * teaching, uh, you know, teaching classes and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like, oh, were kind of traditionally the school's roles.	maybe	###speakerb214.###speakera1.###do you have any particular thoughts about the school system?###speakerb2.###well, um, i, i think that in, in, uh,###recently with the,###i'm not sure if it's more a problem with american families or a problem with the school system.###they seem *-1 to be burdening the school system more and more with problems, any problems that a child might have *t*-2, whether it's actually a school related thing or not###and, i.###speakera3.###speakerb4.###speakera5.###i say agree with you a hundred percent there.###speakerb6.###yeah,### and, and, well, it's gotten *-1 to a point where the schools are expected *-2 to take care of everything *t*-3.###speakera7.###yeah.###speakerb8.###if, uh, you've some kid who *t*-2 doesn't have, uh, who *t*-1's from a broken family, the schools are supposed *-3 to fill that void.
76192:8	whether maybe through a commitment of the p t a, uh, and the parents being informed *-2 better, that in fact that the problems that *t*-1 are nationwide are problems, um, of society, and that, that the school can only do so much on it.	maybe	###speakera15.###um, and, it's seen *-1 more so because when you call parents up *t*-2, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem###and i'll say, they'll say, oh, well, our kids, my kid,###i've never heard anything about this before.###this is the first time 0 there have been problems *t*-1.### and, and, you wonder, don't these parents know that teachers talk,###and, you know, we do check with other teachers,###and other teachers find the same things in this child.###speakerb16.###right.###speakera17.###and, you know, how do you tell your parent's, the parent, hey, * wake up, and smell the coffee *t*-1.###speakerb18.###right.###speakera19.###but, um, it, it is a problem,###and i'm not sure just, uh, how, how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it *t*-1.###speakerb20.###yeah.###speakera21.
76265:42	and then you throw in kids that *t*-1 are not motivated, maybe bright,	maybe	###speakera45.###the,###once they're past e s o l, they get out,###they got thrown right into the total mainstream###speakerb46.###right.###speakera47.###and, uh, there really needs *-1 to be a bridge, some sort of transition for that.###speakerb48.###right.###speakera49.###so the school systems can improve, both in * standing up for splitting classes, you know, having learning dis-, learning, slow, slow children in slow classes, but not mixing them with behavior problems.###speakerb50.###right.###speakera51.###and then, you know, the case where they put the behavior problems in the average classes *t*-1,###you get these kids that *t*-1 are average students but highly motivated.###speakerb52.###right.###speakera53.
76352:14	what could they possibly be thinking *t*-1.	possibly	###we're alerted *-1###speakerb78.###right.###speakera79.###there's all sorts of systems where suicide, uh, predisposition.###i mean, we're alerted *-2 to what the moment 0 we see something *t*-1.###if we see a child that we have any reason, that *t*-1's on drugs, such as if he's got a beeper or if they're, if they're flashing lots of money around. we've, there are certain things 0 * to do *t*-2.###i mean, so tea-, the school system's asked *-1 to do so much,###but you can't operate in a vacuum.###speakerb80.###you actually have students with, with beepers?###speakera81.### this is a, we're in a rather wealthy suburb of washington.###speakerb82.###uh-huh.###speakera83.###and a student with a beeper immediately gets sent *-1 down to the, uh, principal.###speakerb84.###i mean, where,###what are the,
76665:33	uh, the, the call was probably for her.	probably	###it seems like she hasn't talked to anybody from dallas.###in fact, she's talked to a couple of people from north carolina, i think 0 *t*-1.###speakera81.###really?###speakerb82.###yeah.###speakera83.###uh, what is her name *t*-1?###speakerb84.###her name's tina.###speakera85.###yeah.###well, i haven't talked to her.### i haven't, i haven't talked to a tina yet.###speakerb86.###yeah.###speakera87.###speakerb88.###uh-huh.###w-,
76689:33	well, the sport 0 i like *t*-1 best probably is basketball.	probably	###speakera89.###yeah.###speakerb90.###so.###speakera91.###yeah.###speakerb92.###but, uh, some of,###yeah,### i, i've only talked to one or two###and they've, they've all been in dallas.###but, she hasn't talked to anybody, in dallas, yet.###speakera93.###yeah.###yeah.###speakerb94.###so, that's interesting.###speakera95.###well, you haven't told me, uh, what sports that you are active in *t*-1.###speakerb96.
76690:30	but, uh, i guess 0 i'm probably better at softball.	probably	###yeah.###speakerb90.###so.###speakera91.###yeah.###speakerb92.###but, uh, some of,###yeah,### i, i've only talked to one or two###and they've, they've all been in dallas.###but, she hasn't talked to anybody, in dallas, yet.###speakera93.###yeah.###yeah.###speakerb94.###so, that's interesting.###speakera95.###well, you haven't told me, uh, what sports that you are active in *t*-1.###speakerb96.###well, the sport 0 i like *t*-1 best probably is basketball.
76754:7	or maybe this evening anyway.	maybe	###speakerb114.###speakera115.###well, it's getting, a little hot, isn't it *?*?###speakerb116.###so * to speak.###speakera117.###it,###speakerb118.###yeah.###well, it's been raining a lot here so far.###so we haven't really had any kind of real heat.###i think 0 it's going *-1 to be warm enough this afternoon,###we were noticing a while ago 0 it's already eighty in, in the house.###so, it looks like an air conditioner, day.###speakera119.###yeah.###speakerb120.###but,###speakera121.###it sure does.
77003:116	um, from the people 0 i've talked to *t*-1, i don't know if i should bring this into it, but, um, a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers that *t*-3 are more, um, where they could manage their own schedule and, uh, they could spend more time with their kids *t*-2	probably	###but my husband and i have different hobbies.###speakera13.###is he a hunter and a fisher and all that.###speakerb14.###no,###no,###he's a record collector and a hot wheels collector.###speakera15.### that's we-, that's wild.###speakerb16.###um, so he was off today, uh, looking at, at records.###speakera17.###uh-huh.###speakerb18.### so, uh, and i was off, you know, doing, you know, hou-, household type things. you know, laundry###speakera19.###yeah.###speakerb20.###and, um, * did some shopping and stuff.###speakera21.
77032:21	and, and maybe after we decide *-1 to have kids i, i might find a job that *t*-2 has flexible hours.	maybe	### i, i think, i think 0 that would be the ideal situation,###speakera25.###speakerb26.###i think 0 that would be the ideal situation.###i think that a lot of people,###like in my case i, i do shift work.###speakera27.###uh-huh.###speakerb28.### i don't, i don't have that choice.###speakera29.###yeah,###same here.###speakerb30.###um, i have *-1 to be at work at, at x hour, you know, at just, at, at a certain hour###and i can't, it's not flexible.###speakera31.###yeah.###speakerb32.###um, it, it *exp*-1 would be nice * to be able *-2 to have flexible hours
77032:65	and, and maybe after we decide *-1 to have kids i, i might find a job that *t*-2 has flexible hours.	might	### i, i think, i think 0 that would be the ideal situation,###speakera25.###speakerb26.###i think 0 that would be the ideal situation.###i think that a lot of people,###like in my case i, i do shift work.###speakera27.###uh-huh.###speakerb28.### i don't, i don't have that choice.###speakera29.###yeah,###same here.###speakerb30.###um, i have *-1 to be at work at, at x hour, you know, at just, at, at a certain hour###and i can't, it's not flexible.###speakera31.###yeah.###speakerb32.###um, it, it *exp*-1 would be nice * to be able *-2 to have flexible hours
77085:16	unfortunately, that's probably true.	probably	###speakerb46.### the, the mom stayed home, you know, and raised the kids.###my mom didn't go back to work until i was in junior high school.###speakera47.###yeah.###speakerb48.###um, so she was there pretty much all my, you know, formative years.###speakera49.###yeah.###speakerb50.###and that was nice###and i liked that###and i would hope that i would be able *-1 to give that to my kids.###speakera51.###uh.###speakerb52.###but i think 0 with the way 0 the future is, um, economy wise *t*-1,###i don't think 0 it's going *-1 to be realistic.###speakera53.###i know.
77166:24	i think that, uh, probably ninety percent of the, of the, um parents out there are, are probably working parents.	probably	###speakerb72.###um, and they, they do a lot of volunteer work###and they're real active in the community###and, um, they do a lot of things *ich*-1 with their kids that they wouldn't ordinarily be able *-2 to do *t*-3 if they were working.###speakera73.###uh-huh.###speakerb74.###and i'd, i'd like *-1 to be able *-2 to do that.###i'd like *-1 to be able *-2 to stay home and be able *-2 to spend time with my kids.###speakera75.###do volunteer work and, be in clubs and stuff,###speakerb76.###yeah.###speakera77.###yeah,###i agree.###i hope 0 that happens, in my case.###speakerb78.###yeah,###but, i think 0 that's for the, the few and far between.
77166:86	i think that, uh, probably ninety percent of the, of the, um parents out there are, are probably working parents.	probably	###speakerb72.###um, and they, they do a lot of volunteer work###and they're real active in the community###and, um, they do a lot of things *ich*-1 with their kids that they wouldn't ordinarily be able *-2 to do *t*-3 if they were working.###speakera73.###uh-huh.###speakerb74.###and i'd, i'd like *-1 to be able *-2 to do that.###i'd like *-1 to be able *-2 to stay home and be able *-2 to spend time with my kids.###speakera75.###do volunteer work and, be in clubs and stuff,###speakerb76.###yeah.###speakera77.###yeah,###i agree.###i hope 0 that happens, in my case.###speakerb78.###yeah,###but, i think 0 that's for the, the few and far between.
77425:7	and certainly not to the extent 0 i did with my mother *t*-1.	certainly	###it was funny,###i can remember,###and my mother and i have talked about it, to how important it was *t*-1 when i came home from school *t*-2.###speakerb65.###um.###speakera66.###it wasn't really conversation,###but there were always things that *t*-1 just tumbled out.###speakerb67.###yes.###speakera68.###and, uh, uh, granted 0 the child doesn't always think that they're sharing it, but it,### when they, when it's not there *t*-1 they miss it.###speakerb69.###i think 0 that's true,###but i d-, i also think 0 that's, at least in my experience, truer of girls than boys.###speakera70.###uh-huh.###speakerb71.###even when i was there *t*-1, my boys didn't share all that much with me,
77651:70	we, um, as i said, *-1 living in an area of washington, d c. we definitely see this,	definitely	###speakerb153.###yeah.###speakera154.###speakerb155.###well, you were saying what other trends are there *t*-1,###and one just occurred to me because i was editing a book about it recently,###speakera156.###uh-huh.###speakerb157.###and that is the trend in a lot of, uh, lower class areas, for the grandmothers to be raising the children.###speakera158.###yes,###yes,###speakerb159.###and that's,###a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs.###speakera160.###the b-,###yes,###and the broken families.
77984:11	well they might be car pooling too.	might	###they both moved way out.###speakera83.###uh-huh,###yeah.###speakerb84.###i think 0 one of them lives in germantown###and i can't remember where the other one lives *t*-1.###speakera85.###yeah,###but those are ni-, germantown is a nice area.###speakerb86.###uh-huh,###yeah.###speakera87.###it's a nice area.###speakerb88.###it's, means 0 they have *-1 to drive a little bit,###but,###speakera89.###yeah,
77993:44	but, uh, now my daughter ha-, they have probably been carpooling together, in fact,	probably	###but those are ni-, germantown is a nice area.###speakerb86.###uh-huh,###yeah.###speakera87.###it's a nice area.###speakerb88.###it's, means 0 they have *-1 to drive a little bit,###but,###speakera89.###yeah,###well they might be car pooling too.###do they car pool in?###are they driven *-1 by themselves.###speakerb90.###uh, well now, i, i think 0 he carpools,###speakera91.###uh-huh.###speakerb92.###because he's got fairly regular hours since he came back,
78225:14	then that's probably one of the reasons 0 our,	probably	###speakerb78.### not, not really so much.### if, if, if there was some place that, that we went to *t*-2 where there was hiking involved * *t*-3, i, i would be you know, happy * to go *-1 hiking,###speakera79.###uh-huh.###speakerb80.###but we, we never have really planned a vacation around, uh, places 0 * to go hiking *t*-1.###speakera81.###so your, your next, your plans are *-1 try *-2 to find someplace 0 * to s-, scuba dive *t*-3.###speakerb82.###yeah.###our next vacation will, will be scuba diving,###i'm sure.###speakera83.###you have any children?###speakerb84.###no,###not yet.###speakera85.###okay,
78249:66	i think 0 the, the minimum age for diving is, is probably, legal anyway, would be probably about sixteen.	probably	###speakera87.###so some of the things are not as, quite as, uh, adaptable.###speakerb88.###yeah,### it's a, it *exp*-1's a little more, difficult * planning a vacation, when you have, have children *t*-2.###speakera89.###yeah,###it is *?*.###speakerb90.###speakera91.###you have *-1 to try *-2 to figure out kinds of things that you can do *t*-3 that they will enjoy *t*-4, too,###and,###speakerb92.###yeah.###speakera93.###so, i think, wha-,###speakerb94.###yeah,###and diving is something that,###especially for small children, uh,
78249:90	i think 0 the, the minimum age for diving is, is probably, legal anyway, would be probably about sixteen.	probably	###speakera87.###so some of the things are not as, quite as, uh, adaptable.###speakerb88.###yeah,### it's a, it *exp*-1's a little more, difficult * planning a vacation, when you have, have children *t*-2.###speakera89.###yeah,###it is *?*.###speakerb90.###speakera91.###you have *-1 to try *-2 to figure out kinds of things that you can do *t*-3 that they will enjoy *t*-4, too,###and,###speakerb92.###yeah.###speakera93.###so, i think, wha-,###speakerb94.###yeah,###and diving is something that,###especially for small children, uh,
78254:29	eleven or twelve, i would think *t*-1, probably	probably	###speakera89.###yeah,###it is *?*.###speakerb90.###speakera91.###you have *-1 to try *-2 to figure out kinds of things that you can do *t*-3 that they will enjoy *t*-4, too,###and,###speakerb92.###yeah.###speakera93.###so, i think, wha-,###speakerb94.###yeah,###and diving is something that,###especially for small children, uh,###i think 0 the, the minimum age for diving is, is probably, legal anyway, would be probably about sixteen.###speakera95.###yeah.###speakerb96.###speakera97.
78255:9	but, maybe fifteen even.	maybe	###yeah,###it is *?*.###speakerb90.###speakera91.###you have *-1 to try *-2 to figure out kinds of things that you can do *t*-3 that they will enjoy *t*-4, too,###and,###speakerb92.###yeah.###speakera93.###so, i think, wha-,###speakerb94.###yeah,###and diving is something that,###especially for small children, uh,###i think 0 the, the minimum age for diving is, is probably, legal anyway, would be probably about sixteen.###speakera95.###yeah.###speakerb96.###speakera97.###eleven or twelve, i would think *t*-1, probably

78386:82	i i think 0 right, right now while my husband and i don't have any kids we'll probably take as many vacations as we can *?* * doing things like scuba diving and, and adventurous types of things,	probably	###so, you know.###speakerb144.###uh-huh.###speakera145.###so,###speakerb146.###have you been a, to a lot of the different historical sites?###speakera147.###yeah,###we took a trip, uh, around to the, uh, civil war battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something *t*-1,###speakerb148.###uh-huh.###speakera149.###i believe 0 it was *?*.###uh, * had about three kids then i think 0 *t*-1,###but that was a really fun, interesting trip.### i we, we read bruce mumblex book before we went, you know,###and, so we were ready *-1 to look up the places 0 we read about *t*-2.###speakerb150.###yeah,
78786:24	if i did understand politics i probably would vote more,	probably	###speakera119.###no.###speakerb120.### we're kind of, we're really independent.###speakera121.###all split.###speakerb122.###but a lot of families do that.###i know 0 a lot of wives feel like they have *-1 to vote the way that their husbands vote *t*-2.###speakera123.###right.###speakerb124.###and that kind of keeps from * getting a lot of issues resolved *-1.###golly.###speakera125.###i lie. huh.###speakerb126.###but well,###speakera127.###i don't know,
78874:34	and if they don't say yes or no, then maybe somebody *ich*-1 will vote for them that *t*-2 wouldn't have *?* if they had come down on the wrong side.	maybe	###speakerb158.###uh-huh.###speakera159.###i mean, what is, what effect *ich*-2 does that have *t*-1 on him running for president.###do you know what i mean *t*-1?###speakerb160.###yeah,###yeah.###speakera161.###it's all so secretive,###see we really don't see the, the true person anyway.###speakerb162.###that's right.###speakera163.###speakerb164.###i think 0 that's, that's having a big effect on how poorly that the country is being run *-1 *t*-5, is that, um, the, the election, the people that *t*-2 want *-3 to get elected *-4 are turning it into a popularity contest by *-6 advertising the things that, you know, that *t*-7 really don't have anything 0 *t*-8 to do with how well they do the job *t*-9.###speakera165.###right.###speakerb166.###but see they're trying *-1 to find an excuse *-2 not to deal with what, you know, the issues that people really want *-3 to know about *t*-4 *t*-6, because on those issues you have *-5 to say yes or no.
78985:25	uh, i've been recycling for maybe about two years now and, at ano-, ano-, another public facility where they have, you know, recycling of glass, uh, aluminum and paper *t*-1.	maybe	###speakerb10.###and my ap-, facilities,###there it is *t*-1,###* hold on.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###hello.###speakerb12.###okay,###sorry about that.###speakera13.###yeah,###okay,###you're okay,###speakerb14.###yeah.###speakera15.###okay.###speakerb16.###uh, anyhow, they have facilities *ich*-1 here in my apartment complex for * recycling paper only.
79104:13	uh, now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they can't use *t*-1,	maybe	###uh-huh.###speakera63.###and there's,###speakerb64.###right.###speakera65.###i've seen a few things but not very much, really###speakerb66.###uh-huh.###speakera67.###and i, i think 0 that's a shame###they need *-1 to, uh, do a little more,###i'd like *-1 to know, for instance, when i, when they say, uh, plastic, all plastic *t*-4, what kind of plastic, can you put *t*-2 all together###or, is there some reason 0 * not to *?* *t*-1,###speakerb68.###exactly.###speakera69.###speakerb70.###uh-huh.###speakera71.
79159:83	i think, i think * helping us be more enthu-, enthusiastic about it, helping us maybe, maybe using the money for something special that *t*-1 would be like * paying off the national debt.	maybe	###speakerb88.###right,###right,###speakera89.###uh-huh.###speakerb90.###and before even at work, before they started the recycling plan, which at work they've only been doing *t*-1 since january first of this year, i had had everyone in my department recycling###and, you know, i would have them drop, right, drop their cans off in my office###speakera91.###saving them for you, uh.###speakerb92.###and then i would haul them, you know, here to this place for the children's hospital fund which *t*-1 got people really going into it,###speakera93.###uh-huh.###speakerb94.###speakera95.###i think 0 that's, right.###speakerb96.###but,###speakera97.
79159:91	i think, i think * helping us be more enthu-, enthusiastic about it, helping us maybe, maybe using the money for something special that *t*-1 would be like * paying off the national debt.	maybe	###speakerb88.###right,###right,###speakera89.###uh-huh.###speakerb90.###and before even at work, before they started the recycling plan, which at work they've only been doing *t*-1 since january first of this year, i had had everyone in my department recycling###and, you know, i would have them drop, right, drop their cans off in my office###speakera91.###saving them for you, uh.###speakerb92.###and then i would haul them, you know, here to this place for the children's hospital fund which *t*-1 got people really going into it,###speakera93.###uh-huh.###speakerb94.###speakera95.###i think 0 that's, right.###speakerb96.###but,###speakera97.
79316:21	quite a long time, uh, probably five or six years	probably	###well at the present time i have two dogs.###speakerb24.###oh really,###what kind?###speakera25.###an english setter, you know,###that's the white dog with the feathers###and it has, uh, yellow spots on it which they call *t*-1, i think, uh, liver spots.###speakerb26.###uh-huh.###speakera27.###speakerb28.###uh-huh.###speakera29.###and that's a male.###and i have a wonderful female lab, black lab.###speakerb30.###uh-huh,###how long have you had them *t*-1.###speakera31.
79438:57	and he said, uh, a booster, uh, every year or two, i mean, maybe every six months or, or something like that	maybe	###speakerb64.###do you have *-1 to give those?###speakera65.###well i could have *?*,###but i can't give a shot.###speakerb66.###oh, i###* believe me,###i understand.###speakera67.###i took her from enid, oklahoma to oklahoma city every week for six weeks.###speakerb68.###uh.###speakera69.###and, uh, after the, the second shot she was significantly better.###then i didn't notice any improvement till the, after the sixth one.###speakerb70.###uh-huh.###speakera71.###and ever since,
79456:38	like i think 0 german shepherds *ich*-1 do it, and probably large dogs.	probably	###speakera71.###and ever since,###and he said, uh, a booster, uh, every year or two, i mean, maybe every six months or, or something like that###speakerb72.###uh-huh.###speakera73.###and when i notice in the winter, when it's worse *t*-1 *t*-2, you know, it's cold weather and so forth *t*-2 then i have, uh, gotten a booster for her.###but not many people in this part of the country know anything about mumblex.###speakerb74.###um.###speakera75.###i've had *-1 to get it from oklahoma.###they've heard about it###but they've really never used it.###speakerb76.###uh-huh,###yeah,###i've never heard anything about it either.###speakera77.###so dogs that *t*-1 get down in the hips,
79530:10	oh, definitely.	definitely	###so, he gets *-1 to go in and out whenever he wants *-2 to *?* *t*-3.###speakera99.###well of course.###speakerb100.###speakera101.###that's nice,### they, they,###speakerb102.###joey, on the other hand is a little different.###he has *-1 to go out whenever, uh, we ask him *t*-2###and when he, when we ask him *t*-1, he, uh, he barks.###he'll either bark for food,###or he'll bark *-1 to go out###and he'll tell you which one he wants *t*-1.###he's been through obedience school.###speakera103.###well he just can,###well he has been trained *-1###and you've ke-, you've kept u-, it up, haven't you *?*.###speakerb104.
79558:15	i think 0 maybe we have *?*,	maybe	### but, but since i, i didn't want *-1 to,### i, wa-, i just wanted *-1 to let them be able *-2 to be free for a while.###speakerb106.###uh-huh.###speakera107.###so i kept watch and never let them get away,###but now every couple weeks, they wou-, one would slip away###and my neighbor said to me, oh, i noticed 0 those dogs, dogs are so well trained,###anytime 0 they hear your voice *t*-1, they come.###so that made me very proud.###speakerb108.###oh, yeah.###speakera109.###well, have we been talking five minutes?###speakerb110.###i'm not for sure.###speakera111.###i'm not *?* either,###but,###speakerb112.
79564:10	oh, definitely.	definitely	###but now every couple weeks, they wou-, one would slip away###and my neighbor said to me, oh, i noticed 0 those dogs, dogs are so well trained,###anytime 0 they hear your voice *t*-1, they come.###so that made me very proud.###speakerb108.###oh, yeah.###speakera109.###well, have we been talking five minutes?###speakerb110.###i'm not for sure.###speakera111.###i'm not *?* either,###but,###speakerb112.###i think 0 maybe we have *?*,###but,###speakera113.###yeah.###well, um, so it sounds like you keep your pets for pleasure.###speakerb114.
79585:26	and i think 0 it's been probably about five and a half minutes or something.	probably	###have you ever done this before?###speakera115.###yes.###speakerb116.###oh, okay, um,###i haven't ever called.###i've put in the paper work,###i just never made the call.###speakera117.###oh really,###uh-huh.###speakerb118.###yeah,###so i didn't know if they stop you when the time is up *t*-1###or,###speakera119.###no,###they don't,###no.### i, i glanced at the clock when, um, we started *t*-1
79623:10	and * probably just got home.	probably	###well, my best friend in virginia's daughter, is a part of this project in texas.###speakerb128.###oh, i see.###speakera129.###and so she knew that i had the time and would be, would enjoy it.###speakerb130.###uh-huh,###that's true.###speakera131.###um, so.###speakerb132.###i mean, i,###speakera133.###but i have a hard time * getting anybody, because i guess,###do you work.###speakerb134.###um, yes###i do.###speakera135.###yeah,
79652:60	but my husband had been ma-, in fact, he's been, probably has made a few more calls than i have *?* because i tend *-1 to not make them around dinner time,	probably	###i was going *-1 to tell you the same thing.###they're really looking for a lot more men 0 *t*-1 to participate.###speakera139.###yeah,###my husband does.###speakerb140.###does he.###yeah,###i need *-1 to,###speakera141.###yes.###speakerb142.###i've got some applications,###i need *-1 to hand them out.###but, uh, this is a great project, that they're working on *t*-1###and it's really going *-1 to lead the way, uh, for a lot of econ-, um, applications and, and development in the voice area.###speakera143.###yes,### wh-, i think so too,###and i haven't helped them out on the me-, on men particularly,
79663:8	well maybe i'll get you next time.	maybe	###speakerb142.###i've got some applications,###i need *-1 to hand them out.###but, uh, this is a great project, that they're working on *t*-1###and it's really going *-1 to lead the way, uh, for a lot of econ-, um, applications and, and development in the voice area.###speakera143.###yes,### wh-, i think so too,###and i haven't helped them out on the me-, on men particularly,###but my husband had been ma-, in fact, he's been, probably has made a few more calls than i have *?* because i tend *-1 to not make them around dinner time,###speakerb144.###uh-huh.###speakera145.###i try *-1 to, you know, make them do, during the day,###but nobody's home.###speakerb146.###well this is the perfect time for me.###speakera147.###well good.###speakerb148.
79709:31	i use them mostly for big things, like maybe, sometimes, uh, tuition if it's, you know, if i'm short, *-2 to go ahead and get it and then try *-1 to get it saved *-3 back as quick as i can *?*.	maybe	###speakerb6.###right.###speakera7.###the interest rate is so high that you're really,###if you're going *-1 to use credit cards you need *-2 to use that policy, i think 0 *t*-3, don't you?.###speakerb8.###yeah.###speakera9.###otherwise, you end up *-1 paying so much more for your merchandise that it's hardly, uh, it's not a very good idea.###speakerb10.###that's right.###speakera11.###speakerb12.###do you have a lot of credit cards?###speakera13.###well, i have a lot of them###but i don't use them very much, though.###speakerb14.###right.###speakera15.
79816:14	even before it probably wasn't *?*, though, because you didn't get anywhere near as much as what it, you didn't get *-3 to claim anywhere near what you ended up *-2 paying *t*-1.	probably	###so it's, it's, uh, it's, uh, it's a really big problem i think, and, um, takes mature people *-1 to, to treat it, uh,###speakerb50.###yeah.###speakera51.### so that it's, so that it's a real advantage to you, instead of a disadvantage.###speakerb52.###right.###i think, um, 0 the way 0 the tax system was *t*-1, they encouraged people to use credit cards, you know, with a big write off at the end of the year.###speakera53.###yeah.###speakerb54.###but now, it's like, it's punch money, because###speakera55.###right.###it didn't do you any good now, does it?###speakerb56.###you can not,###right.###you can not write off your interest.###speakera57.
80239:16	it's probably, i would think 0 it would be hard on your, your legs and your joints and stuff.	probably	###i've been wanting *-1 to get a ten speed * to ride around.###i'm scared *-1 to run, for dogs.###course i know 0 dogs can get you on a bike too,###but, * seems like it,###speakera129.###yeah.###speakerb130.###speakera131.###at least you got a chance * to out run them that way.###speakerb132.###yeah.###speakera133.###i don't like *-1 to run myself.###i've thought about it several times###and i just, it, i like *-1 to move a little faster and cover more ground.###speakerb134.###well they,###yeah,###they've come up that running is not as good for you as they thought 0 it was *?*.###speakera135.
80268:10	at least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could *?*	maybe	### and, uh, but i, i, i like jogging,###i don't mind that.###i can get out and do that, as long as it's not hot.###speakera139.###uh, i can't.###speakerb140.###if it's hot, you can't do that.###but in the rain, oh, i love *-1 to run in the rain,###just, you know, * be careful *-1 not to slide.###speakera141.###yeah.###speakerb142.###but you can't ride your bike at all in the rain, can you *?*.###speakera143.###no,###you can't *?*,###it's dangerous.###speakerb144.###you slide.###speakera145.
80320:24	and i'm thinking about * maybe sponge painting them. either that or * maybe rag rolling. to give it kind of a country look.	maybe	###anyway, * have fun * exercising.###speakera155.###all right.###speakerb156.###all right,###bye-bye.###speakera1.###what kind of painting are you planning *-2 to do *t*-1?###speakerb2.###well i have wallpaper *ich*-2 in both of my bathrooms right now which *t*-1 is really pretty disgusting.###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.###and, um, it's a rent house###and i decided 0 it *exp*-1's too expensive * to rewallpaper###so i decided 0 i'm going *-1 to paint.###speakera5.###uh-huh.###speakerb6.###and i've been *-1 buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways 0 * to paint *t*-2.
80320:48	and i'm thinking about * maybe sponge painting them. either that or * maybe rag rolling. to give it kind of a country look.	maybe	###anyway, * have fun * exercising.###speakera155.###all right.###speakerb156.###all right,###bye-bye.###speakera1.###what kind of painting are you planning *-2 to do *t*-1?###speakerb2.###well i have wallpaper *ich*-2 in both of my bathrooms right now which *t*-1 is really pretty disgusting.###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.###and, um, it's a rent house###and i decided 0 it *exp*-1's too expensive * to rewallpaper###so i decided 0 i'm going *-1 to paint.###speakera5.###uh-huh.###speakerb6.###and i've been *-1 buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways 0 * to paint *t*-2.
80380:11	because you might find that it's beyond, uh, what you're willing *-2 to put *t*-1 into it. although i think 0 it could turn out really nice.	might	###oh, yeah,###that should be nice.###speakerb22.###so it's going *-1 to have kind of a country look.###speakera23.###uh-huh.###speakerb24.###um, and i haven't even decided as far as, um, what kind of paint * to buy *t*-1.###i don't have an actual instruction book###so i'm really in kind of the beginning stages right now.###speakera25.###well, uh.###speakerb26.###um, it's going *-1 to be a big experiment.###speakera27.###yeah,###i was about *-1 to say, 0 you ought *-2 to experiment on at least a small part of it before you just tackle the whole thing.###speakerb28.###yeah.###speakera29.
80457:24	if it's paper it will probably shred.	probably	###speakerb52.###well that's something that, that *'s worthwhile * checking into *t*-1 then.'cause i,###speakera53.###if it's really old, you don't know what it's put on with *t*-1.###speakerb54.### it, it *exp*-1's hard * to tell,###it's,###the patterns look like they're nineteen sixties style.###speakera55.###yeah.###speakerb56.###and i know 0 the house, um, was built *-1 around the mid fifties.###speakera57.###uh-huh.###speakerb58.###so it may be the original wallpaper.###speakera59.###* could be *?*,###yeah.###um, if it's vinyl it *exp*-1 should be easier * to strip too.
80459:48	um, in one bathroom it's, um, it's probably paper, uh,	probably	###speakera53.###if it's really old, you don't know what it's put on with *t*-1.###speakerb54.### it, it *exp*-1's hard * to tell,###it's,###the patterns look like they're nineteen sixties style.###speakera55.###yeah.###speakerb56.###and i know 0 the house, um, was built *-1 around the mid fifties.###speakera57.###uh-huh.###speakerb58.###so it may be the original wallpaper.###speakera59.###* could be *?*,###yeah.###um, if it's vinyl it *exp*-1 should be easier * to strip too.###if it's paper it will probably shred.###speakerb60.
80480:121	well i, i've also been *-4 thinking about, after * looking at all these magazines, um, these design magazines and stuff, i'm thinking about maybe *-1 painting the bedroom walls too, in a color that *t*-2 will kind of, um, tie in our, um, our, um, our, uh, comforter, with a color that *t*-3's kind of a, um, burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design.	maybe	###it's silver, silver and yellow, and white.###speakera61.###um, uh-huh.###speakerb62.###speakera63.###well the wallpaper that i was trying *-1 to remove *t*-2 was black,### i-, this was in a bathroom too.###and the, the tiles were sort of a mottled grey and had a little trim strip of maroon and white###and the, the wallpaper in that bathroom had a black background###and then it had vivid, uh, almost neon colors of hot pink and turquoise, and lime green and silver, and, uh, a little bit of yellow that *t*-1 looked like coral sands and sea horses and things like that.###speakerb64.###um, that's kind of an odd color for a bathroom.###speakera65.###oh it was awful,###it was absolutely hideous### and, and we had a dinner party before we started *-1 renovating it###and a, a guest went in there###and he said 0 it *ich*-2's a good thing 0 i went to the bathroom before dinner because if i had had something 0 * to drink *t*-1 and went in there i would think 0 i was having hallucinations.###speakerb66.###really.
80488:20	i don't know if maybe i'm biting off more than i can chew *?*.	maybe	###and the, the wallpaper in that bathroom had a black background###and then it had vivid, uh, almost neon colors of hot pink and turquoise, and lime green and silver, and, uh, a little bit of yellow that *t*-1 looked like coral sands and sea horses and things like that.###speakerb64.###um, that's kind of an odd color for a bathroom.###speakera65.###oh it was awful,###it was absolutely hideous### and, and we had a dinner party before we started *-1 renovating it###and a, a guest went in there###and he said 0 it *ich*-2's a good thing 0 i went to the bathroom before dinner because if i had had something 0 * to drink *t*-1 and went in there i would think 0 i was having hallucinations.###speakerb66.###really.###well i, i've also been *-4 thinking about, after * looking at all these magazines, um, these design magazines and stuff, i'm thinking about maybe *-1 painting the bedroom walls too, in a color that *t*-2 will kind of, um, tie in our, um, our, um, our, uh, comforter, with a color that *t*-3's kind of a, um, burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design.###speakera67.###uh-huh.###speakerb68.###speakera69.###uh-huh.###speakerb70.###um, and i'm not really quite sure,
80494:16	well the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting.	probably	###it was absolutely hideous### and, and we had a dinner party before we started *-1 renovating it###and a, a guest went in there###and he said 0 it *ich*-2's a good thing 0 i went to the bathroom before dinner because if i had had something 0 * to drink *t*-1 and went in there i would think 0 i was having hallucinations.###speakerb66.###really.###well i, i've also been *-4 thinking about, after * looking at all these magazines, um, these design magazines and stuff, i'm thinking about maybe *-1 painting the bedroom walls too, in a color that *t*-2 will kind of, um, tie in our, um, our, um, our, uh, comforter, with a color that *t*-3's kind of a, um, burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design.###speakera67.###uh-huh.###speakerb68.###speakera69.###uh-huh.###speakerb70.###um, and i'm not really quite sure,###i don't know if maybe i'm biting off more than i can chew *?*.###speakera71.###well i'd say * tackle one project first and see how it goes *t*-1###and if you discover 0 you like it then you can always upscale.###speakerb72.###yeah,
80568:24	well if i were closer i might *?*.	might	###um.###speakera93.###and the whole point of * using it is * to save yourself work.###you can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape.###but * use, use good, uh, stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands, that *t*-1 will go down and come up easily *t*-2.###speakerb94.###okay.###speakera95.###speakerb96.###well i really appreciate all the helpful tips,###i think 0 you are, just made my project a lot easier.###speakera97.###well i wish you very good luck with it###and i will tell you that i have retired from the painting business.###the last time 0 i had something done * *t*-1 was my kitchen cabinets###and i decided 0 that was too much 0 * to tackle *t*-1,###i'd hire a professional.###speakerb98.### if you were, if you were closer i'd, i'd, i'd tell you 0 you could come over and supervise.###speakera99.
80606:65	and i, i feel that the, the only legitimate paper, although it might sound, a little elitist is the new york times.	might	###speakera105.###okay,###bye-bye.###speakerb106.###it *exp*-1's was nice * talking to you kathleen.###speakera107.###* thank you.###speakerb108.###bye-bye.###speakerb1.###i think 0 i get most of my news, uh, in headlines from the radio,###and then i follow-up by *-2 reading the newspaper and news magazines about things that *t*-1 attract my attention.###speakera2.###well, i, i do about the same, i guess 0 *t*-1, but in a different fashion.### i, i, i'm from new york originally###and now that i live in florida,###i live in the florida in the winter and then go back up north in the, in the summertime###speakerb3.###uh-huh.###speakera4.
80753:33	they ju-, they really are probably the worse papers 0 i've ever read *t*-1.	probably	###speakerb53.###so i subscribe to the san jose mercury news.###speakera54.###is that pretty good?###speakerb55.###palo alto is about midway between.###well it's a whole lot better than that san francisco paper###and,###speakera56.###oh the, what is that *t*-1,###the chronicle isn't it *t*-2?###speakerb57.###yeah,###there's the chronicle, and the examiner,###speakera58.###oh.###speakerb59.###but they're, uh, both run *-1 by the same peo-,###speakera60.###oh yeah,
81047:11	i've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times.	probably	###speakera55.### that, oh, that's horrible,###that is horrible###and their, their, the language on that's filthy.###speakerb56.###i don't see why they have *-1 to do that *t*-2,### i mean, i mean n-, everybody knows that it, that the, the language is there so they could just ignore it and, you know, use different words instead, i think 0 *t*-1.###speakera57.###yeah.###speakerb58.###speakera59.###yeah.###speakerb60.###speakera61.###yeah,###yeah,###i know.###speakerb62.###but i, i think 0 lately pretty woman's been my favorite.###i went and bought the video.
81186:19	because we saw it, probably, four or five months ago.	probably	###speakerb104.###and i think 0, you know, around here, it's all ready quit *-1 playing.###but i don't, i don't know if it's still playing any where else.###speakera105.###well i, i think,###speakerb106.###but it was, it was, it was one of those that *t*-1 kept you on the edge of your seat.###speakera107.###real good.###speakerb108.###speakera109.###i want *-1 to see that.###yeah,###i seen the, uh, previews for it on t v down here,###but it's just been down here a couple weeks, i think 0 *t*-1.###speakerb110.###oh, okay,###speakera111.###yeah.###speakerb112.
81443:26	well i, i certainly hope so.	certainly	###speakerb190.###yes,###i did,### that, that just reminded me of that.###did you like it?###speakerb1.###well carol since today's subject is our homes,###why don't you tell me about yours *t*-1.###speakera2.###okay,###i live in plano, in a four bedroom, two bath house, which *t*-1 is###the area's dominantly three bedroom, two bath.###so, i'm just a little bit different than typical, uh,###and of course, the plano area is basically with alleyways,###so everything around here is set *-1 up that way. which i think 0 *t*-4 is a little bit different than most areas, in the houses, the way 0 they're constructed *-3 *t*-2.###and it's a brick house, with, uh, some wood.###it's real nice,###i like it.###how about you?###speakerb3.
81458:11	ours is probably the closest to it.	probably	###and it's a brick house, with, uh, some wood.###it's real nice,###i like it.###how about you?###speakerb3.###well i, i certainly hope so.###we have a, a classic ranch, up in denton.###ranch style home,### i shou-, i would hate *-1 to think that anybody thought, uh, 0 the lot 0 we live on *t*-2 as a ranch.###uh, it's in a subdivision and one story.###it started out life as a three bedroom house, and now has no two car garage and has, uh, the two extra rooms enclosed *-1.###i suppose 0 we still only have three effective bedrooms###but we gained a playroom for the kids and an office out of *-1 enclosing the garage.###speakera4.###are most of the houses in your area three bedroom, two bath?###speakerb5.###almost a hundred percent.###speakera6.###speakerb7.### i, i can't think of any four bedroom houses in the subdivision.
81469:42	the only thing about mine, um, i think 0 there's probably about, oh,	probably	###i suppose 0 we still only have three effective bedrooms###but we gained a playroom for the kids and an office out of *-1 enclosing the garage.###speakera4.###are most of the houses in your area three bedroom, two bath?###speakerb5.###almost a hundred percent.###speakera6.###speakerb7.### i, i can't think of any four bedroom houses in the subdivision.###ours is probably the closest to it.###you know how realtors are *t*-1,###they'll say, oh this could be five bedrooms.###yeah,###if you had two people that *t*-1 don't have any clothes it could be a five bedroom house,###speakera8.###yeah,###to.###speakerb9.###* don't need a closet.###speakera10.
81472:43	but they're spaced *-1 out, oh i'd say *ich*-2 maybe three, on a two block period.	maybe	###are most of the houses in your area three bedroom, two bath?###speakerb5.###almost a hundred percent.###speakera6.###speakerb7.### i, i can't think of any four bedroom houses in the subdivision.###ours is probably the closest to it.###you know how realtors are *t*-1,###they'll say, oh this could be five bedrooms.###yeah,###if you had two people that *t*-1 don't have any clothes it could be a five bedroom house,###speakera8.###yeah,###to.###speakerb9.###* don't need a closet.###speakera10.###the only thing about mine, um, i think 0 there's probably about, oh,###when i go down the street *t*-3 i can just pick out houses that *t*-1 are, that *t*-2 are identical to mine###and usually they are the four bedroom, um,
81517:5	maybe someday when i feel really ambitious and an-, get angry *t*-2 i'll start *-1 poking holes up there,	maybe	###well i hadn't thought about it in that sense, of the high roofs.###we have cathedral ceilings in, uh, two rooms. in the, uh, family room and in the master bedroom###and those are, are pleasant.###speakera14.###yeah.###well it's like when my son goes up into the, up into the furnace area over the garage *t*-1.###speakerb15.###yeah.###speakera16.###he can walk###and he's six foot.###and he says, oh, * come on up mom.###i'm not going up there.###speakerb17.###speakera18.###i'm not going up there,###but he says 0 there's plenty of room up there for a room.###so that means 0 if i knock out the wall in my family room, i could make another room overlooking my family room from upstairs with no problem.###but, um, i'm not that ambitious.###i tol-,
81521:96	ninety, i would say 0 about, oh, about ninety-five percent, no i guess 0 may-, probably a hundred percent of them all are mostly brick, uh, with some wood.	probably	###yeah.###well it's like when my son goes up into the, up into the furnace area over the garage *t*-1.###speakerb15.###yeah.###speakera16.###he can walk###and he's six foot.###and he says, oh, * come on up mom.###i'm not going up there.###speakerb17.###speakera18.###i'm not going up there,###but he says 0 there's plenty of room up there for a room.###so that means 0 if i knock out the wall in my family room, i could make another room overlooking my family room from upstairs with no problem.###but, um, i'm not that ambitious.###i tol-,###maybe someday when i feel really ambitious and an-, get angry *t*-2 i'll start *-1 poking holes up there,###but until that time.###but, uh, i've noticed 0 the houses around here are basically, it's one story and they're all basically two, uh, bath, two, uh, with three bedrooms.###and we're
81547:17	so you're just as likely *-1 to fl-, wake up and discover 0 you're in two inches of water.	likely	###and the one on the other side of me is about the same as mine.###but, uh, the one on opposite the street now, they're total brick###and they're basically almost all three, two.###they're all three, two.###but of course they have a little river *ich*-2 going down their area too, which *t*-1 is kind of nice.###speakerb21.###if it's the kind of river 0 i'm thinking of *t*-1, better them, than, than us, you know.###are you talking about a, a real river, creek?###speakera22.###no###it's a creek,###they've put little fountains in and such.###speakerb23.###well that's nice.###uh, i came from mississippi recently###and the rivers that we had *t*-1 there were the ones that *t*-2 came with the rains###and they didn't pay any, any attention to banks and that kind of stuff.###speakera24.###oh.###speakerb25.
81703:15	i mean, maybe, one snow.	maybe	###speakera15.###yeah###speakerb16.###and, uh,###speakera17.###that's causing the hole in the ozone.###speakerb18.###uh-huh.###yeah,###that's very serious.###i mean, we can, we're even feeling the effects of the weather from, uh, uh, the shift in the jet stream.###speakera19.###uh-huh.### it, it is scary though, isn't it *?*?###speakerb20.###oh yeah.###i mean, uh, the last two, uh, years, our winters have been absolutely nothing.###speakera21.###right.###speakerb22.
81908:11	it's probably a lot worse now.	probably	### i, i have no sense of smell,###so i couldn't smell this,###but it would make me sick,###and i'd be real tired anyway just from * walking along the highway.###speakerb90.###um.###speakera91.###speakerb92.###uh-huh.###speakera93.###speakerb94.###golly, that's, that's bad.###speakera95.###but,###yeah,###it's,###yeah,###all the exhaust.###uh,###well, that was four years ago, too,
81973:9	so, maybe that's part of the reason 0 it's not so bad down here *t*-1.	maybe	###for ozone, and oh, yeah, all that.### they're, they're real big into it.###they've got research triangle park here,###and they're, you know, they're just doing a lot of, uh, lot of stuff.###speakera111.###huh.###but, they,###i don't hear much about it down here.###course, texas, we don't have a bunch of c-, pollution.###speakerb112.###huh-uh.###speakera113.###but, too, we've got that air coming in off the coast.###speakerb114.###oh, uh-huh.###speakera115.###and you know it'd blow it up north.###speakerb116.###uh-huh.###speakera117.
82671:55	well, i, i've been, uh, i have probably had more time than you have *?* 0 * to think about this subject *t*-1,	probably	###i mean, you get *-1 to stay home,###i mean it's not just for him,###but it's also for you, because you're both kind of bonding together there too, i think 0 *t*-1,###so.###speakera164.###yeah,###that's true.###speakerb165.###well it *exp*-1's been nice * talking to you.###speakera166.###well it *exp*-1's nice * talking to you, too.###speakerb167.###okay###good luck.###speakera168.###okay.###speakerb169.###okay,###good-bye.###speakera1.
82690:16	uh, we're probably making a comparison against, uh, some european and, uh, and, uh, uh, s-s-say, newer republics that, uh, that *t*-1 have very high percentages.	probably	###speakera1.###well, i, i've been, uh, i have probably had more time than you have *?* 0 * to think about this subject *t*-1,###speakerb2.###uh-huh.###speakera3.###so i'll tell you,###is it a serious problem?###yes,###i do believe 0 it's a serious problem.###speakerb4.###yeah.###speakera5.###speakerb6.###uh-huh.###speakera7.###however, there are solutions to it.###speakerb8.###uh-huh.###speakera9.###and foremost, uh, where we compare w-, that we are now doing fifty percent of our, uh, people are voting.
82708:49	my solution to that is that we hold it on sundays. as do probably sixty to seventy percent of the european countries now.	probably	###speakera9.###and foremost, uh, where we compare w-, that we are now doing fifty percent of our, uh, people are voting.###uh, we're probably making a comparison against, uh, some european and, uh, and, uh, uh, s-s-say, newer republics that, uh, that *t*-1 have very high percentages.###speakerb10.###uh-huh.###speakera11.###speakerb12.###uh-huh.###speakera13.###uh, so, uh, one of the reasons, uh, that, uh, o-, one of the reasons that we could get, uh, one of the reasons that it is lower in the united states *t*-1 is that mostly we hold it on tuesdays.###god knows why we hold it on tuesdays *t*-1.###and then we further complicate it by *-1 saying, you know, 0 we will keep the polls open until eight o'clock.###speakerb14.###what...###speakera15.###speakerb16.###right.###speakera17.### most people, uh, a great number of people now work at various, at different jobs that,###if a third of the people are shift workers, they won't be able *-1 to get to the, to the polls in any case. if they, uh, have *-2 to work late into the evening and not get up.
82785:8	well maybe that is another factor, the motivational factor.	maybe	###so registrations are perhaps a, a problem also.###and we're the mobile, mobile society, uh,###speakerb46.###uh-huh.###speakera47.###people are always mo-, you know,###one out of every seven people moves every year.###uh, th-, that is almost a fourteen percent turnover every, you know,###speakerb48.###uh-huh.###speakera49.###if you compound that, that, uh, eh- eh, th-,### i-, if it *exp*-2 is difficult * to register *-1 to vote, that would remove your eligibility * to vote.###speakerb50.###but i do not think 0 it is difficult enough * to prevent people who *t*-1 are motivated in the first place, who, or, who *t*-2 are not just motivated who *t*-3 really believe that their, they, their voice is heard *-4.###speakera51.###well.###speakerb52.###i mean, and the people that i have talked to *t*-1...###speakera53.
82786:15	the motivational factor is probably...	probably	###and we're the mobile, mobile society, uh,###speakerb46.###uh-huh.###speakera47.###people are always mo-, you know,###one out of every seven people moves every year.###uh, th-, that is almost a fourteen percent turnover every, you know,###speakerb48.###uh-huh.###speakera49.###if you compound that, that, uh, eh- eh, th-,### i-, if it *exp*-2 is difficult * to register *-1 to vote, that would remove your eligibility * to vote.###speakerb50.###but i do not think 0 it is difficult enough * to prevent people who *t*-1 are motivated in the first place, who, or, who *t*-2 are not just motivated who *t*-3 really believe that their, they, their voice is heard *-4.###speakera51.###well.###speakerb52.###i mean, and the people that i have talked to *t*-1...###speakera53.###well maybe that is another factor, the motivational factor.
82948:7	and maybe he will *?*.	maybe	###well, then why did he say that during his campaign *t*-1?###speakera107.###oh, he, he he gave it,### he did he did, he promised the best 0 he could *?* *t*-1.###speakerb108.###then he,###it was totally irr-...###speakera109.###and he is the president###and he should, he should address those problems###and if there needs *-1 to be a change in a period of time.### wh-, what *t*-1 was so funny about it is that, i guess, that it happened so rapidly, you know.###he knew it.###he actually knew it.###and *-1 being associated *-2 with government, he should be held *-1 up to the light for that.###speakerb110.###yeah.###yeah.###yeah.###speakera111.
83015:30	so, if you really computed it, they probably	probably	###speakera133.###speakerb134.###huh.###speakera135.### but th-, but, you know, everything is relative to when, uh, eh, w-w-, you know, we had higher turnouts *t*-1 because at that time we cur-, talk about the turnout relative to the eligible voter, right?###speakerb136.###yeah.###speakera137.###i mean is,### but, but before these enormous, before this voting rights act, what we had *t*-1 was a, a great deal of our population, uh, mainly the blacks in the south and the hispanics were precluded *-2 by, by, uh, voting laws, uh, from * reg-, from their eligibility * to register.###speakerb138.###uh-huh.###speakera139.###speakerb140.###oh.###speakera141.###now everybody is available.###speakerb142.###oh.###speakera143.
83092:142	uh, i think that the judges should be left *-1 to do most of the sentencing, simply because, uh, there is always, uh, there is, there is always a jury that *t*-2 might be swayed *-3, uh, by the moment, uh, * to either to be too lenient or too vengeful, i guess 0 *t*-5.	might	###did you not press one?###speakera163.###i did press one,###but usually by this time they tell me that the time is up.###speakera1.###well, uh, it seems to me that, uh, that###i do not know whether the jury system, uh,### i, i should not say 0 i do not know.###i do not feel very, uh, stronger that the jury system should be changed *-1.###it seems *-1 to have worked, uh, time immemorial.###and when, uh, difficult decisions, uh, are made *-1 *t*-2, uh, uh, uh, they generally prove out *-3 to be right by things that *t*-4 occur later on.###speakerb2.###uh-huh.###speakera3.###uh, i know 0 in some cases now in some states, depending on the criminal code, uh, a unanimous verdict is not required *-1.###and indeed some juries are no longer twelve people,###they are down to as little, as small as six people in, i think, in petty, in, in, uh, in, uh, in minor felonies, and, uh, and misdemeanor trials.###speakerb4.###uh-huh.###speakera5.
83119:18	you know, that might be it.	might	###yeah.###speakerb10.###speakera11.###but, i mean, is not that, uh, is that a reflection *ich*-1 then of what *t*-2 is really happening in the real world?###speakerb12.###speakera13.### if, if, if they keep *-1 giving everybody hundred year sentences,###and the people in various states, it does not seem that people want *-1 to be taxed *-2 *-2 to build more prisons. or even in, for that matter, uh, repair the, uh, the lack of judges and, and, and other, uh,###speakerb14.###yeah.###i think 0 that is what *t*-1 is happening.###i think, uh, 0 the judges are trying *-1 to save the people from * having to, the cost of new prisons.###speakera15.###speakerb16.###speakera17.###yeah,###speakerb18.###they,###speakera19.###yeah,
83120:33	i mean, they, they certainly,	certainly	###speakerb10.###speakera11.###but, i mean, is not that, uh, is that a reflection *ich*-1 then of what *t*-2 is really happening in the real world?###speakerb12.###speakera13.### if, if, if they keep *-1 giving everybody hundred year sentences,###and the people in various states, it does not seem that people want *-1 to be taxed *-2 *-2 to build more prisons. or even in, for that matter, uh, repair the, uh, the lack of judges and, and, and other, uh,###speakerb14.###yeah.###i think 0 that is what *t*-1 is happening.###i think, uh, 0 the judges are trying *-1 to save the people from * having to, the cost of new prisons.###speakera15.###speakerb16.###speakera17.###yeah,###speakerb18.###they,###speakera19.###yeah,###you know, that might be it.
83144:8	you might be right about that.	might	###speakerb22.###speakera23.### i do not, i don't know how it is *t*-1 in virginia,###speakerb24.###speakera25.###speakerb26.###speakera27.###but in florida now, uh, uh, uh, at eighteen years, someone was just sentenced *-1 to eighteen years, i heard it on today, uh, without any specific recommendation for, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, * waving the normal, uh, procedures.###and the eighteen years will, uh, translate into something like, uh, four point seven, if every, if the, if the prisoner is a model prisoner,###speakerb28.###yeah.###speakera29.###and indeed the present overcrowding conditions, uh, prevail.###speakerb30.###speakera31.###plus, i guess, 0 there was some credit for time 0 this guy had already spent in jail * waiting for trial *t*-1.###speakerb32.###right.###speakera33.###so, uh, yeah,
83254:25	but there, there definitely is, uh, uh, you know, to me the, one of the worst things that *t*-1 could ever happen, uh, from what i read and see and understand *t*-2.	definitely	###anyway, the deterrent. for people to, to commit the cri-, uh, to not to commit the crime is sort of gone away.###speakera67.###yes.###speakerb68.###people have,###i do not know,###they just do not care any more.###the benefit, i guess 0 *t*-2, of crime outweighs what the deterrent is *t*-1.###speakera69.###uh, and yet there are, there are so many, there are so many people in prison.###speakerb70.###you know, people that,###speakera71.###i mean the prison population, uh, as far as i, i, uh, you know,###my impression of it is that it has, that it has doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty.###speakerb72.###um.###speakera73.###i mean it,### so has our, i guess 0 our population has grown some too.
83315:59	i mean, just because you feel like he was being kicked on, which he certainly was *t*-1, you know.	certainly	###speakerb92.###speakera93.###i was there during the, during the trial actually,###yeah.###speakerb94.###yeah.###and the opposite was true of me.###uh, after the case was over, i was like, somebody get ahold of these people and find out why in the world did they vote the way 0 they did *t*-1 *t*-2, you know.###speakera95.###yeah,###speakerb96.###speakera97.###yeah,###yeah.###speakerb98.###it was like, well, a picture is not good enough.###we want *-1 to see,###i do not know what they wanted *t*-1 honestly.###did they want the guy to,###i do not know.
83345:5	maybe when you are there in the r-, in the courtroom yourself and you are sitting there and you have got *-1 to make a judgment on somebody *t*-2.	maybe	###speakera103.###speakerb104.###the guy was obviously guilty.###speakera105.###no,###but,###speakerb106.###speakera107.###yeah.###i always balanced in the, in the situation.###i remember the jurors, uh,###i thought to myself, how did, how did### they only, i think 0 they only, uh, found him guilty on one count. which *t*-1 was, uh, not even, which *t*-3 was a class something felony. which *t*-2 was not even punishable, uh, uh, to the degree that they thought 0 it.###speakerb108.### one, one count.###speakera109.###speakerb110.###yeah.###speakera111.###but i do not know,
83347:7	or maybe the evidence was not as sensational as the media presented it *?*.	maybe	###the guy was obviously guilty.###speakera105.###no,###but,###speakerb106.###speakera107.###yeah.###i always balanced in the, in the situation.###i remember the jurors, uh,###i thought to myself, how did, how did### they only, i think 0 they only, uh, found him guilty on one count. which *t*-1 was, uh, not even, which *t*-3 was a class something felony. which *t*-2 was not even punishable, uh, uh, to the degree that they thought 0 it.###speakerb108.### one, one count.###speakera109.###speakerb110.###yeah.###speakera111.###but i do not know,###maybe when you are there in the r-, in the courtroom yourself and you are sitting there and you have got *-1 to make a judgment on somebody *t*-2.###and the prosecutors do a lousy job,
83352:8	that might be it.	might	###speakera107.###yeah.###i always balanced in the, in the situation.###i remember the jurors, uh,###i thought to myself, how did, how did### they only, i think 0 they only, uh, found him guilty on one count. which *t*-1 was, uh, not even, which *t*-3 was a class something felony. which *t*-2 was not even punishable, uh, uh, to the degree that they thought 0 it.###speakerb108.### one, one count.###speakera109.###speakerb110.###yeah.###speakera111.###but i do not know,###maybe when you are there in the r-, in the courtroom yourself and you are sitting there and you have got *-1 to make a judgment on somebody *t*-2.###and the prosecutors do a lousy job,###or maybe the evidence was not as sensational as the media presented it *?*.###i mean, i, i am not making excuses for.###speakerb112.###yeah.###speakera113.
83426:8	they probably built that in so they could make money.	probably	###and, uh, he, he took the alter-, the guy in, in the parts shop took the alternator###and he put it on the little thing 0 he has *t*-1 in there 0 *t*-2 to test them###and, uh, he said 0 there was nothing wrong with the alternator###so we, we went back and tried it again, put it on again###and it still didn't work,###and we took the car up to, um, a little place called * pep boys,###i don't know if you have them in your area###speakerb12.###uh-huh.###speakera13.###but, uh, they're, they're pretty reasonable, uh, car repair place also.###so, uh, * took it up there, towed it up there because it, you know, wouldn't start or anything###and this thing just kept *-1 blowing out the fuses###and, uh, * took them about an, an hour *-2 to, um, figure out what *t*-3 was, what *t*-4 was blowing the fuse,###and it was, it was the alternator that *t*-1 was blowing the fuse.###anyway, * ended up *-1 taking it to the toyota dealer###and the only problem was that, uh, it had *-1 to be a genuine toyota, uh, alternator because most of the other ones that they say 0 *t*-2 will fit it, that, that, you know, they sit in there and everything###but there's just some little difference that, um, *t*-1 causes it not to work an i-,###speakerb14.###uh-huh,
83509:26	i've only taken, uh, maybe two trips that *t*-1 were about four hours long dow-, uh, down to shreveport.	maybe	###speakera31.###um, well, i used, i used *-1 to work, uh,###speakerb32.###speakera33.###it was a seventy mile trip everyday, you know,###two ways was seventy miles.###speakerb34.###oh, a hundred and forty mile trip?###speakera35.###no,### it was, it was just seventy miles.###speakerb36.###oh, thirty-five miles each way.###speakera37.###yeah.###speakerb38.###yeah.###speakera39.###and, uh, i did that for about three years###and it really, it really added up.
83567:27	and, uh, i've done it maybe twelve times.	maybe	### you, you call that number### and, and, uh, somehow or another they'll give you an option * to leave a message###and you can leave a message.###speakerb54.###okay.###speakera55.###i know someone that *t*-1 did that,###you leave a message###and they'll, they'll call you back.###speakerb56.###okay,###all right,###well that's good 0 * to know *t*-1.###i haven't been doing### th-, this is the first time 0 i've been called *-2 *t*-1 in a long time###and i haven't been doing it###so,###speakera57.###oh really.###speakerb58.
83583:30	i, i figured 0 maybe i'd get one or two years out of it,	maybe	###so,###speakera57.###oh really.###speakerb58.###and, uh, i've done it maybe twelve times.###speakera59.###uh-huh.###speakerb60.###well i don't know if i've done it quite that much,###but, uh, mine is mixed up too,###i have *-1 to call and get it fixed *-2.###speakera61.###uh, * let's see###before i had this car i had a, um, i bought an audi five thousand###speakerb62.###uh-huh.###speakera63.###but i bought it, i bought it *-1 used.### i, i just bought it from a friend who *t*-1 was going *-2 to, who *t*-3 just charged me what the dealer was going *-4 to give, give him *t*-5 for it for a trade-in,###and, uh, it had a whole lot of miles on it.
83598:26	i think 0 those old cars might, might be a pretty good bet because you,	might	###uh-huh.###speakera63.###but i bought it, i bought it *-1 used.### i, i just bought it from a friend who *t*-1 was going *-2 to, who *t*-3 just charged me what the dealer was going *-4 to give, give him *t*-5 for it for a trade-in,###and, uh, it had a whole lot of miles on it.### i, i figured 0 maybe i'd get one or two years out of it,### an i, an i did get a couple of good years out of it###and the, uh, the engine messed up on me###and then i gave it to a guy *ich*-3 *-4 to repair who *t*-1 works for the aut-, for the audi dealer###and, uh, he took the engine apart###and, you know, he just said 0 he couldn't fix it###so the engine never got put *-1 back together again.###speakerb64.###huh, oh well.###speakera65.###i,###speakerb66.###i was driving a sixty-six plymouth fury.###speakera67.###wow.
83598:34	i think 0 those old cars might, might be a pretty good bet because you,	might	###uh-huh.###speakera63.###but i bought it, i bought it *-1 used.### i, i just bought it from a friend who *t*-1 was going *-2 to, who *t*-3 just charged me what the dealer was going *-4 to give, give him *t*-5 for it for a trade-in,###and, uh, it had a whole lot of miles on it.### i, i figured 0 maybe i'd get one or two years out of it,### an i, an i did get a couple of good years out of it###and the, uh, the engine messed up on me###and then i gave it to a guy *ich*-3 *-4 to repair who *t*-1 works for the aut-, for the audi dealer###and, uh, he took the engine apart###and, you know, he just said 0 he couldn't fix it###so the engine never got put *-1 back together again.###speakerb64.###huh, oh well.###speakera65.###i,###speakerb66.###i was driving a sixty-six plymouth fury.###speakera67.###wow.
83680:55	i mean, it, it was pro-, probably was up to your shoulder in, in thistles.	probably	###so,###speakerb6.###well, the topic today was gardening, and lawn care?###speakera7.###uh-huh.###speakerb8.###ooh.###speakera9.###i know,###we are *-1 about to hit it in ten, few minutes.###i figured 0 i could make this call and get it over with.###we are going *-1 to mow and trim and edge,###speakerb10.###yeah.###speakera11.###and that is all 0 we have been doing *t*-1 all weekend.###speakerb12.###you know what?###it seems like we are doing it here forever.###we bought a, a large house that *t*-1 was completely unlandscaped.
83688:19	and i have since then probably ripped out half of what he has done *t*-1 because it has always been incorrectly planted *-2	probably	###i know,###we are *-1 about to hit it in ten, few minutes.###i figured 0 i could make this call and get it over with.###we are going *-1 to mow and trim and edge,###speakerb10.###yeah.###speakera11.###and that is all 0 we have been doing *t*-1 all weekend.###speakerb12.###you know what?###it seems like we are doing it here forever.###we bought a, a large house that *t*-1 was completely unlandscaped.###i mean, it, it was pro-, probably was up to your shoulder in, in thistles.###speakera13.###speakerb14.###that was all that *t*-1 was there.###speakera15.###uh-huh.###speakerb16.###and we hired a professional landscaper to do it.
83692:130	and so i am kind of at this point getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going *-1 to do *t*-2 is 0 we are just going *-3 to struggle through the rest of this year, probably through the fall too. and, uh, rip up, rip out all the rest of these junipers or anything that *t*-4 requires, uh, more care than i am willing * to give the kids *t*-5 and replace it with hollies.	probably	###speakerb10.###yeah.###speakera11.###and that is all 0 we have been doing *t*-1 all weekend.###speakerb12.###you know what?###it seems like we are doing it here forever.###we bought a, a large house that *t*-1 was completely unlandscaped.###i mean, it, it was pro-, probably was up to your shoulder in, in thistles.###speakera13.###speakerb14.###that was all that *t*-1 was there.###speakera15.###uh-huh.###speakerb16.###and we hired a professional landscaper to do it.###and i have since then probably ripped out half of what he has done *t*-1 because it has always been incorrectly planted *-2###or the plants do not make the winter time.###speakera17.###speakerb18.
83809:11	i have probably planted, oh, around here, um, maybe six hundred bulbs.	probably	###it is a bulb.###speakerb58.###well you should of just ripped the whole thing out.###speakera59.###no,###because i do like the, i like the plant in the spring.###i love those pink flowers.###they are just pretty.###so i just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other plants down. because i want them to come back up next year.###speakerb60.###have you had,###is this the first year 0 they have been up *t*-1?###speakera61.###yeah.###speakerb62.###well, * let me tell you,###they do not come back very well at all.###maybe they will *?* if, up further north.###but down,###and you are not that much further north.
83809:38	i have probably planted, oh, around here, um, maybe six hundred bulbs.	maybe	###it is a bulb.###speakerb58.###well you should of just ripped the whole thing out.###speakera59.###no,###because i do like the, i like the plant in the spring.###i love those pink flowers.###they are just pretty.###so i just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other plants down. because i want them to come back up next year.###speakerb60.###have you had,###is this the first year 0 they have been up *t*-1?###speakera61.###yeah.###speakerb62.###well, * let me tell you,###they do not come back very well at all.###maybe they will *?* if, up further north.###but down,###and you are not that much further north.
83814:15	i have probably have done hyacinths.	probably	###because i do like the, i like the plant in the spring.###i love those pink flowers.###they are just pretty.###so i just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other plants down. because i want them to come back up next year.###speakerb60.###have you had,###is this the first year 0 they have been up *t*-1?###speakera61.###yeah.###speakerb62.###well, * let me tell you,###they do not come back very well at all.###maybe they will *?* if, up further north.###but down,###and you are not that much further north.###i have probably planted, oh, around here, um, maybe six hundred bulbs.###speakera63.###of hyacinths?###speakerb64.###no,
83995:60	because i have got a flower, i have got, i have probably got, do, do, do, do, i do not know how many square feet it is *t*-1, a big circular driveway.	probably	###speakera127.###but they call them flags up here or down here, down here.###speakerb128.###well, i am not so sure that texans know what, what they have got *t*-1.###speakera129.###yeah.###speakerb130.###speakera131.###i do not know what it is *t*-1.### i am, i am not on, i am just getting into gardening this year.###speakerb132.###did you just move down here?###speakera133.###uh, we moved here a year ago.###yeah,###last spring.###we moved in here may, this house, may of last year.###so it *exp*-1 was really too late * to do much.###speakerb134.###um. who, who, who, who.
84149:18	that is, uh, probably enough * to see.	probably	###speakera4.###yeah.###i was going *-1 to say.###speakerb5.###we hear a lot about, uh, new york city.###speakera6.###uh-huh.###speakerb7.###there is a lot of crime down there.###and i am, i am afraid *-1 to go down there because, you know, i mean, you hear about people getting mugged *-2.###you leave your car for ten minutes###and it is stripped when you come back *t*-1.###speakera8.###yeah.###have you ever been there?###speakerb9.###no,###i have not *?*.###only to the airport.###speakera10.
84333:10	oh, definitely.	definitely	###that###and i do not think 0 a lot of parents,###i mean, i do not, i do not know how it is *t*-1 in the air force base.###but, uh, i just do not think 0 a lot of people, because of the economy, both need *-1 to work, you know.###i just do not think 0 a lot of parents are that involved any more.###speakerb67.###yeah.### they do not, they do not talk to their kids and take them out. and, and are not there all the time###speakera68.###uh,###speakerb69.###so the kids are off to their own devices a lot.###speakera70.###right.###and discipline.###i do not know how your folks were *t*-1,###but i mean i sure knew as heck when i was growing up *t*-1 that, uh, my parents were the superior###and i was the subordinate.###and, you know. it was sort of like there were boundaries.###speakerb71.
84339:14	i think so definitely.	definitely	###yeah.### they do not, they do not talk to their kids and take them out. and, and are not there all the time###speakera68.###uh,###speakerb69.###so the kids are off to their own devices a lot.###speakera70.###right.###and discipline.###i do not know how your folks were *t*-1,###but i mean i sure knew as heck when i was growing up *t*-1 that, uh, my parents were the superior###and i was the subordinate.###and, you know. it was sort of like there were boundaries.###speakerb71.###oh, definitely.###speakera72.###and i do not think, i do not know,###i think 0 today a lot of parents, um, are ruled *-1 by their kids.### i, i,###speakerb73.
84545:10	and i probably got more nasty than i should have *?*.	probably	###i mean, i, they, we lease out a really nice two story town home in north dallas.###and they have a real big thing here.###people, i mean, even dry cleaners knock on the door and are soliciting, you know.### they, everybody wants your business kind of thing.###speakerb133.###right.###speakera134.###and my husband is the kind of guy, 0 he's, *t*-1 he's sometime,###he was raised *-1 on a farm in southern ohio, near dayton.###and i think sometimes 0 it is just, 0 he and i are very different in terms of that.### i, i mean, i basically have started *-1 not to trust anybody in general street smarts.###speakerb135.###right.###speakera136.###speakerb137.###we,###speakera138.###and, uh, he opened the door.###i came downstairs###and i was real upset
84713:11	that is probably one of the most bizarre 0 i have heard of *t*-1.	probably	###right.###speakera194.###speakerb195.###right.###speakera196.###kids killing each other and beating their brains out.###speakerb197.###oh, for the sneakers.###speakera198.###right.### or the, or the jackets, the team like the raiders and the caps.###speakerb199.###yeah.###speakera200.###speakerb201.###yeah.###speakera202.###you know, * stealing the hundred dollar jackets.###uh, i mean, it is i guess, it goes from the most petty like that to like what you were saying that they, in boston.###that is crime where they videoed *t*-1.
84743:106	and we've always, uh, oh tried *-1 to take our children and no-, now at this age our grandchildren to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able *-3 to *?* *t*-2.	might	###how do you feel about it *t*-1?###speakerb2.###well, yeah,###i feel much the same way.###i've, uh, two kids right now###speakera3.###yeah.###speakerb4.###one is two and a half###and one's nine months,###and, uh, that age, of course, everything 0 you do *t*-1 they're trying *-2 to learn *-3 to do,###and so, uh, it *exp*-1's important for you * to spend time * doing the things that you want them to learn *t*-2, you know, that, that they need *-3 to learn *t*-4 at the age, you know * reading, and, uh, reading and playing nice with others, and that sort of thing.###speakera5.###yeah.###speakerb6.###speakera7.###yeah,###we went through this with our children, and now with our grandchildren,###and i've always tried *-1 to do things with them, uh, like, when you're at the little league *t*-2, * helping out even though i'm not a good athlete myself,###i was able *-1 to help the coach in, in * just controlling the kids, if nothing else,
84768:8	it certainly does, because, uh, you know, the things in the books seem so dead to the kids, you know, unless they've actually been there or whatever,	certainly	###speakera9.###yeah,###yeah.###and so, it's uh,###we have, uh, lived several places around the u s###and we have, where we've lived *t*-1, we've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area,###like when we lived in tennessee *t*-1, we, we took them to washington, d c * to see all the capitol and, and things like that when they were small *t*-2.###and it's just, uh, it *exp*-2's helps, i think, the children to, when they're learning in school *t*-1, * to say, well, i've been there###and i've seen that.###speakerb10.###right.###speakera11.###yeah.###speakerb12.###uh-huh.###speakera13.###yeah,###so, uh, that's the type,###speakerb14.###yeah,
84933:26	and, and, we certainly turned into an air conditioned society.	certainly	###speakerb14.###yeah.###speakera15.###speakerb16.###i would think so.###you know, uh, i-, i guess 0 it talked about all types of pollution.###i happen * to r-, just read something the other day###at least in the boston paper there were three things that, that *t*-1 come to note.###one, is that the carbon fluorides that *t*-1 are, uh, being released *-2 into the atmosphere are causing even a larger hole in the southern hemisphere in the ozone layer###and again###and now they've located another one or la-, rather an expanding one in the northern hemisphere.###so car-,###so i'm quite concerned.###i don't think 0 it's involved *ich*-1 any longer with, with, uh, hair sprays or those th-,###speakera17.###yeah.###yeah.###speakerb18.###no,###i think 0 it's now, is what, uh, from what i understand *t*-1 it's air conditioning units
85011:5	certainly we don't even need a, need a research anymore.	certainly	###speakerb42.###no,###i think that it can be done *-1 simply because, uh, uh, we've, we've,###every car *ich*-4 now in america that *t*-1's been produced *-3 for the past fifteen years has what they call *t*-2 a catalytic converter.###speakera43.###converter,###yeah,###uh-huh.###speakerb44.###and no lead gas was, came to the pumps.### and, and that's been done *-1.###there's the lead pollution### has, that problem, essentially i guess because it was at crisis proportions was, was licked *-1.###speakera45.###uh-huh.###speakerb46.###and i think that there are th-, there are solutions,###speakera47.###and that mumblex for buses,###speakerb48.
85168:42	well, i, i, d-, definitely advance that.	definitely	###exactly.###speakera105.###speakerb106.###well, the greatest thing that *t*-1 happened to pollution in the last couple of years as far as i'm concerned, is the no smoking rules, on airplanes and in restaurants.###speakera107.###speakerb108.###and it, it really is a pleasure for me, although, i guess 0 smokers don't think that.###but that, to me was pollution mumblex,###speakera109.###well, that, that's, that's person-, that's personal air pollution.###speakerb110.###speakera111.###speakerb112.###that was its most personal, personal, uh, pollution that i can think of *t*-1.###speakera113.###yes,###yes.###speakerb114.###speakera115.###yeah,
85453:87	this is called *-1 the, the, the country, you know, with only, you know, maybe twenty miles total from d c, twenty-five from the city.	maybe	###and, uh, in the, in the dallas, you know, fort worth city areas you don't see that.###speakerb95.###yeah,###well, uh, texas is a big state###so i imagine 0 the, the type of houses and, uh, things like that are truly different from area to area.###speakera96.###yeah,###well,###speakerb97.###but, uh, that's the same way out here###because, um, well, we, for example, and we live fifteen miles from the beltway that *t*-1 surrounds washington###speakera98.###uh-huh.###speakerb99.###and anything instead that beltway, the highway, the real estate's forty thousand dollars more expensive.###speakera100.###yeah.###speakerb101.###so, you know, you really can't afford, i, i, i could never afford a house inside the beltway.###that's why we came out here *t*-1.
85579:31	i mean, you know, we can maybe help them a little bit, prompt them,	maybe	###speakerb18.###that will be fine.###speakera19.###okay.###well, hi,.###speakerb20.###hi.###speakera21.###good morning.###um, i think i mean, if, if i start this i just wanted *-1 to say that, um, one of the things that i don't think 0 we really understood *t*-2 about the, the middle eastern situation is that they're a totally different type of people than we are *?*,###and i mean they think differently###and their idea of what *t*-1 is justice is totally different from ours.### and, and right now, i, i think that that's been proven *-1 in the fact that, um, they have just,###well, anyway, i just think that, you know, the united states policy over there,###i think 0 we should just leave them alone.###i really do. in, in a major way because they just, um, that whole region over there, i think 0 *t*-2 needs *-1 to settle its own differences within itself.###speakerb22.###yeah.###speakera23.###and that's the way, the course that they should go *t*-1,
85584:21	and, and maybe this is too general,	maybe	###speakerb20.###hi.###speakera21.###good morning.###um, i think i mean, if, if i start this i just wanted *-1 to say that, um, one of the things that i don't think 0 we really understood *t*-2 about the, the middle eastern situation is that they're a totally different type of people than we are *?*,###and i mean they think differently###and their idea of what *t*-1 is justice is totally different from ours.### and, and right now, i, i think that that's been proven *-1 in the fact that, um, they have just,###well, anyway, i just think that, you know, the united states policy over there,###i think 0 we should just leave them alone.###i really do. in, in a major way because they just, um, that whole region over there, i think 0 *t*-2 needs *-1 to settle its own differences within itself.###speakerb22.###yeah.###speakera23.###and that's the way, the course that they should go *t*-1,###i mean, you know, we can maybe help them a little bit, prompt them,###but i don't think 0 this intervention at such high levels should be going on.### the, the thing with israel and palestine, i believe 0 that should be settled *-1 between them.###and also, um, you know, the other thing is 0 their idea, or our ide-, idea of democracy has nothing 0 * to do *t*-1 with them.### i mean, tha-, i mean, i'm talking about the whole middle ea-,
85596:58	i, i guess 0, you know, i'd like you to maybe express something here.	maybe	###yeah.###speakera23.###and that's the way, the course that they should go *t*-1,###i mean, you know, we can maybe help them a little bit, prompt them,###but i don't think 0 this intervention at such high levels should be going on.### the, the thing with israel and palestine, i believe 0 that should be settled *-1 between them.###and also, um, you know, the other thing is 0 their idea, or our ide-, idea of democracy has nothing 0 * to do *t*-1 with them.### i mean, tha-, i mean, i'm talking about the whole middle ea-,### and, and maybe this is too general,###but i just believe that, um, they do not look at democracy the same way 0 we do *t*-1.###they don't understand it as we don't understand the way 0 they live *t*-1.###speakerb24.###yeah.###speakera25.###and, so, you know, * trying *-1 to put like a square peg in a round hole is just, you know,### i-, i don't think that that's the way 0 * to go *t*-1 in this###and, um, you know, it, it. oh, well, that's, that's a couple thoughts on it.###speakerb26.###yeah.###speakera27.
85619:13	the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there	certainly	###i think 0 it's kind of sad *ich*-2 though, that, for generations they've been taught *-1 to hate each other.###speakera29.###yeah.###speakerb30.###and that's, i-, you know,###if,###somewhere in there someone's going *-1 to have *-2 to learn a different way.###speakera31.###that's,###yeah.###speakerb32.###you know, an, an, i, i think that, um,###true we do have completely different ways of * looking at things, at a lot of things,###but, uh, at the same time, i think 0 there are a lot of, there is a lot of good that the united states and other countries can do *t*-1, as far as example### and, and, uh,, i think 0 some different things *ich*-2 could come from what *t*-1's happened *t*-1, than what we expect *t*-3.###speakera33.###well, ye-,###well, yeah,###um, i, i guess 0 we could be a catalyst for their change.###i, um,
85634:17	and i think 0 maybe it's at a whole different level of them trying *-1 to cooperate and get along.	maybe	###speakera33.###well, ye-,###well, yeah,###um, i, i guess 0 we could be a catalyst for their change.###i, um,###the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there###and i don't think 0 we'd be talking about this, you know, the israeli situation, palestinian situation, um, sort of came to a head, um, unless there had been a war.###i mean that was one thing *ich*-2, that *t*-1 came out of it, good or bad,###speakerb34.###yeah.###speakera35.### i, i don't judge any war as good or bad,###it's just a war.###speakerb36.###yeah.###speakera37.###and i don't see any winners or losers,###i just see dead bodies.###i'm sorry. you know,###but, um, i-, i, i just think 0, you know, you're right
85810:17	so i assume that probably the total cove-, cost is probably, three fifty to four hundred.	probably	###speakera9.###speakerb10.###uh-huh.###speakera11.###speakerb12.###right.###uh, i, i was listening, uh, on the radio the other day###and they were talking that, s-, s-, something like this,###i think 0 they were talking about the fact that, um, the money that *t*-1 could be saved *-2, um, in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by * consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider, um, could, uh, could,###they could make it, i-, i-, provide health insurance to, to people who *t*-2 couldn't afford it just by the money 0 they would save *t*-1.###speakera13.###yeah.###uh, we're currently, where i'm working now, under blue cross *t*-1.###speakerb14.###speakera15.###i don't know what the total cost of the program is *t*-1###but for dependent coverage i'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars a, a month or something like that.###speakerb16.###right.###speakera17.
85810:44	so i assume that probably the total cove-, cost is probably, three fifty to four hundred.	probably	###speakera9.###speakerb10.###uh-huh.###speakera11.###speakerb12.###right.###uh, i, i was listening, uh, on the radio the other day###and they were talking that, s-, s-, something like this,###i think 0 they were talking about the fact that, um, the money that *t*-1 could be saved *-2, um, in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by * consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider, um, could, uh, could,###they could make it, i-, i-, provide health insurance to, to people who *t*-2 couldn't afford it just by the money 0 they would save *t*-1.###speakera13.###yeah.###uh, we're currently, where i'm working now, under blue cross *t*-1.###speakerb14.###speakera15.###i don't know what the total cost of the program is *t*-1###but for dependent coverage i'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars a, a month or something like that.###speakerb16.###right.###speakera17.
85813:11	they're probably picking up about half of it.	probably	###speakera11.###speakerb12.###right.###uh, i, i was listening, uh, on the radio the other day###and they were talking that, s-, s-, something like this,###i think 0 they were talking about the fact that, um, the money that *t*-1 could be saved *-2, um, in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by * consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider, um, could, uh, could,###they could make it, i-, i-, provide health insurance to, to people who *t*-2 couldn't afford it just by the money 0 they would save *t*-1.###speakera13.###yeah.###uh, we're currently, where i'm working now, under blue cross *t*-1.###speakerb14.###speakera15.###i don't know what the total cost of the program is *t*-1###but for dependent coverage i'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars a, a month or something like that.###speakerb16.###right.###speakera17.###so i assume that probably the total cove-, cost is probably, three fifty to four hundred.###speakerb18.###speakera19.
85823:198	or one of, whatever the type name is *t*-1, h m o, uh, where the, uh, where you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest *t*-3. if you tried *-2 to buy something like that, i'm prob-, it would probably be five or six hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something.	probably	###speakerb14.###speakera15.###i don't know what the total cost of the program is *t*-1###but for dependent coverage i'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars a, a month or something like that.###speakerb16.###right.###speakera17.###so i assume that probably the total cove-, cost is probably, three fifty to four hundred.###speakerb18.###speakera19.###they're probably picking up about half of it.###speakerb20.###right.###speakera21.###and that's a pretty good policy,###but if you had something like one of these, uh, health maintenance programs,###speakerb22.###speakera23.###speakerb24.###speakera25.
86169:41	and you also get in *-2 to see things that you might not get into *t*-1 if you were alone, uh,	might	###it *exp*-2 doesn't matter who it is *t*-1###and they keep everyone else away from you.###speakerb66.###oh really.###speakera67.###and it's worth it###and it's like ten dollars a day or something###and it's worth it just * to keep everyone else away from *-1 badgering you###speakerb68.###really.###speakera69.###and you feel stupid *-1 doing that###but we did it,###speakerb70.###uh-huh.###speakera71.###and we were much happier,###speakerb72.###uh-huh.###speakera73.
86215:29	if you don't like wildlife it's probably not of interest.	probably	###and so, hopefully, we'll get *-1 to travel a little bit too.###speakerb86.###uh-huh.###speakera87.###uh, my more exciting spots have been,###i've been to the galapagos islands.###speakerb88.###really?###speakera89.###uh-huh,###that was one of the most wonderful vacations 0 i've ever had *t*-1.###speakerb90.###lots of wildlife huh?###yeah.###speakera91.###yes.###if you like wildlife, it's a fabulous vacation.###speakerb92.###uh-huh.###speakera93.
86329:5	maybe it was about a thousand dollars, maybe a little bit less, i don't really remember, for ten days including all my meals, a guide, a car, the airfare	maybe	###speakerb132.###really?###speakera133.###yeah.###speakerb134.###oh wow.###speakera135.###china was a little bit more, uh, of a challenge.###but, it, it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because i hired a guide all the time,###speakerb136.###uh-huh.###speakera137.###and so i never *ich*-1, you know, got out by myself, or not much,###speakerb138.###uh-huh.###was it very expensive?###speakera139.###no,###actually i paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit,###no
86329:28	maybe it was about a thousand dollars, maybe a little bit less, i don't really remember, for ten days including all my meals, a guide, a car, the airfare	maybe	###speakerb132.###really?###speakera133.###yeah.###speakerb134.###oh wow.###speakera135.###china was a little bit more, uh, of a challenge.###but, it, it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because i hired a guide all the time,###speakerb136.###uh-huh.###speakera137.###and so i never *ich*-1, you know, got out by myself, or not much,###speakerb138.###uh-huh.###was it very expensive?###speakera139.###no,###actually i paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit,###no
86589:11	it would definitely be gun control.	definitely	###speakera69.###right,###right.###speakerb70.###you know, i think 0 if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit,###course, i-, i, i feel kind of weird about that###anyway, i think 0 if somebody shoots somebody, they ought *-1 to be shot *-1.###speakera71.###yeah,###i'm,###speakerb72.###so.###speakera73.### we, we're getting into capital punishment now.###speakerb74.###yeah,###but, you know.###speakera75.###but i, i agree with you there that, uh,###speakerb76.
86657:22	one of these days my grandkids probably.	probably	###speakera97.###yeah.###speakerb98.###i don't,###and i enjoyed my guns.###speakera99.###yeah.###speakerb100.###i have a good time with them###so,###speakera101.###well i know what, uh,###i took my kids out and taught them out, how * to shoot a gun *t*-1.###my wife the same thing,###uh, she knows how * to shoot any weapon that we have *t*-1 *t*-2### no-, not that i have an arsenal or anything,###speakerb102.###yeah.###speakera103.###but we have several guns around the house
86716:15	and, i was probably about twelve at the time,	probably	###speakera115.###speakerb116.###but at least it was a b b gun not a twenty-two or a four ten or something###so,###speakera117.###i remember 0 i had an old uncle up by tulsa, oklahoma that *t*-1 took me out and, uh, showed me.### this was, it was not my, it was my mother's uncle,###this was a gentleman in his sixties,###speakerb118.###um.###speakera119.###and he took me out with him and, uh, single shot twenty-two, and taught me how * to shoot *t*-1.###speakerb120.###uh-huh.###speakera121.###we went *-1 squirrel hunting### and, and, uh, he taught me how * to shoot, uh, a old single shot twenty-two *t*-1###speakerb122.###all right.###speakera123.
86824:50	i am not even, i am not even convinced *-3 that maybe things like football, hockey and, th-, th-, the, you know, the, and even baseball games now where the, everything is settled *-2 with a fight *t*-1.	maybe	###speakerb20.### what do you, what do you think 0 *t*-1 is causing all this,###speakera21.###well,###speakerb22.###because, it seems that there###even though###crime, though i think 0 it is increasing in number, it sure does seem *-1 to be increasing in intensity, and violence too.###speakera23.###yes.###speakerb24.###speakera25.###well, i, i have three theories about it, you know, three things.###i have one theory,###and it's brought *-1 to us by two things.###one i, i believe that this is a function of, uh, the violence that young people see *t*-1 on television and the movies.###speakerb26.###uh-huh.###speakera27.###and, i am not just talking about, you know, uh, role models of gu-, of tough guys and gangsters and things like that,
87405:56	you know, the bourgeoisie was, was, was definitely out of, uh, style, then.	definitely	###so * tell me about china cry.###speakerb4.###okay,###china cry was basically the, the true story written * by this, this lady who *t*-3 had, uh, was a native, a native chinese, uh, uh, who *t*-4 was raised *-5 by christian parents.###speakera5.###uh-huh.###speakerb6.###and her, her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty-nine revolution.###speakera7.###i see.###speakerb8.###although she, herself, had never really accepted jesus or gone through any of the other, uh, christian, uh, portions of, of the faith, repentance, baptisms, et cetera, et cetera. she had always felt a very strong, uh, leaning in this direction.###and whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty-nine occurred *t*-1 and most churches were either banned *-2 or their, all the clergy and so forth were killed *-3 or, or imprisoned *-3 or, and the property confiscated *-4, she was safe because she had, you know, not officially joined the, the christian movement.###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###so, anyway, she, as she grew up towards maturity, her parents,###well, her dad was a doctor### and, and he was rather well, you know, rather well *-1 to do in the old regime###and the, the chin-, the commu-, the communist chinese didn't like this at all.
87481:13	and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly.	probably	###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb30.###speakera31.###oh.###speakerb32.###and they knew that she wasn't going *-1 to come back,###but yeah, she did, years later when the, uh, liberalization, you know, in real life liberalization of china happened *t*-1,###speakera33.###uh-huh.###speakerb34.###and, uh, she was not persecuted *-1 or anything else like that.###speakera35.###huh. interesting story.###speakerb36.###yes,###it was *?*.###uh, very moving, too.###speakera37.### i, uh, i don't even remember *-1 seeing that advertised *-2
87606:99	so i'm no-, i'm, uh, think that the, we really ought *-1 to seriously consider what an income tax might do *t*-2 that, uh, for texas	might	###uh-huh.###speakera79.###so, uh,###speakera1.###well, we, uh,###taxes,###everyone thinks 0 taxes are too high i'm sure 0 *t*-1.###but, uh, i think 0 we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars 0 we spend *t*-1 in most cases.###what do you think *t*-1?###speakerb2.###uh, yeah,### i, i think so.### i, i'm, uh, i think 0 i'm, i think 0 i'm, uh, a little out of the ordinary in that, that i, i, uh, i think 0 i'm more worried about the deficit, the national deficit than, than, uh, a lot of other people are *?* and think that we need *-1 to, we need *-2 to either raise our taxes or, or cutback on something###and i don't know what * to cutback on *t*-1 * to, to get, to get that, to get that settled *-2.###speakera3.###at this stage it *ich*-1's hard, * to tell.###speakerb4.### and, and, uh, and, uh, i know 0 i'm a real, a real, uh, out of it in terms of taxes###speakera5.###speakerb6.
87635:74	and, and * realizing that that, that, that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to, uh, *-1 to go for that, because we supported the,	might	###yeah.###speakera11.###i know###i live in richardson###speakerb12.###yeah.###speakera13.###and it's up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house.###speakerb14.###yeah,###yeah.###speakera15.###but now we're getting public services, the schools, the hospitals###and if it weren't for the taxes 0 we're putting *t*-1 in there, uh, * look what the schools could cost you *t*-2.###speakerb16.###yeah,###yeah.###yeah,###now i'm, uh, uh, oh, i,### we'd, when we moved to r-, richardson *t*-2, one of the reasons 0 we chose it *t*-1 was for the, uh, for the schools.
87657:21	that would provide, uh, possibly some relief there * to utilize some of the property taxes for other things *t*-2, see.	possibly	###yeah.###speakerb18.###speakera19.###then again the, the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent,###and the public, colleges also, the tuition has got *-1 to be among the lowest in the country.###speakerb20.###yeah.###speakera21.###uh,###speakerb22.###yeah.###speakera23.###one of the,###uh, i believe, i don't know which one it is *t*-1 *ich*-3, uh, down there whether it's hobby or, uh, the other ex-governor down there that *t*-2 are proposing *-4 doubling the tuition.###well if you double the tuition, it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states.###speakerb24.###yeah,###i think 0 that's right.###speakera25.###yeah.
87687:105	but all the various taxing authorities that *t*-1 come through, i think 0 the one tax 0 i resent *t*-4 the most though is the additional sales tax for dart which *t*-2 is probably never going *-3 to be in existence in my lifetime.	probably	### i, i,###speakera31.###yeah.###well, i quit ten years ago###so i, i couldn't afford *-1 to start again.###speakerb32.###i see.###okay.###no, uh,###speakera33.###speakerb34.###yeah,###well, that, that, that would be true.###that would be true.###but,###speakera35.###i know, uh, 0 my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes i think 0 *t*-1.###speakerb36.###huh.###speakera37.
87780:21	i think 0 that will probably do it,	probably	###yeah.###speakera69.###speakerb70.###yeah.###speakera71.###we saw about them traveling to san francisco *-1 to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something.###speakerb72.###speakera73.###i felt 0 that was a little, uh, wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying *t*-1, you know.###speakerb74.###a little bit much.###oh, yeah.###yep.###yep.###oh, the c-,###speakera75.###well, that's about all 0 i can say *t*-1 at this time.###speakerb76.###yeah,### i th-, i think so,
87845:10	but you might not be so you know, so encouraging, of susan sarandon and then gena davis when they do it *t*-1.	might	###speakera15.###a disturbing movie,###how do you mean *t*-1?###speakerb16.###well, it was,###um, * let 0's see.###the, um,### it's, it's different,### it's kind of, it's an action adventure kind of, you know, * shoot'em up kind of film.###speakera17.###right.###speakerb18.###but it's with women in it instead of men###so that's kind of a that's kind of a twist on the normal thing.###speakera19.###a switcheroo,###huh?###speakerb20.###and it made me think a lot about, you know,###you would applaud bruce willis in die hard if he was doing this
87862:127	because that, that just reminds me of, you know, like back in school and, you know, the girlfriends just taking off for a day or something. just getting in trouble and probably not that much trouble	probably	###speakerb20.###and it made me think a lot about, you know,###you would applaud bruce willis in die hard if he was doing this###but you might not be so you know, so encouraging, of susan sarandon and then gena davis when they do it *t*-1.###speakera21.###right.###speakerb22.###speakera23.###speakerb24.###speakera25.###when the shoe is on the other foot *t*-1 and see how it,###speakerb26.###so, that was kind of interesting.###i've,###but i really enjoyed it.###speakera27.###oh.###speakerb28.###so, i w-,###speakera29.
87951:11	that's probably the last movie 0 i saw *t*-1. um, dances with wolves,	probably	###she is *?*.###she's rich.###speakera55.###yeah,###and she's rich###and she,###yeah,###so.###speakerb56.###mumblex she's smart at what she does *t*-1.###she knows how * to do that *t*-1.###speakera57.###she knows how * to twist this around *t*-1,###huh?###speakerb58.###yeah.###what did you think *t*-1 about dances with wolves when you saw it *t*-2?###speakera59.###well, okay,###see, we're getting back to last year.
87957:40	um, a couple years ago, i guess, well, maybe ten years ago i, i had read * bury my heart at wounded knee	maybe	###yeah,###so.###speakerb56.###mumblex she's smart at what she does *t*-1.###she knows how * to do that *t*-1.###speakera57.###she knows how * to twist this around *t*-1,###huh?###speakerb58.###yeah.###what did you think *t*-1 about dances with wolves when you saw it *t*-2?###speakera59.###well, okay,###see, we're getting back to last year.###that's probably the last movie 0 i saw *t*-1. um, dances with wolves,###i just adored it.###speakerb60.###really?###speakera61.###how can i tell you *t*-1.
87994:10	so there possibly were because you know 0 you always have conflict in the world.	possibly	###speakera69.###and now it's back again.###and, you know, it's sort of a popular view of, um, what *t*-1 happened way back then.###speakerb70.###right.###speakera71.###of course, no one will ever know.###really i don't kn-,###speakerb72.###i know,###i was,###i wondered if, uh, the tribes that they represented *t*-2 the tribe that *t*-1 was the, the evil tribe, if they were really as bad as it made them to be *?*.###speakera73.###well, who *t*-1 knows.###i mean it, it, it sort of showed like two different types of tribes###like one was a warring tribe,###and the other one was, uh, vegetarian kind of, you know, * feel good tribe. you know, sort of thing,###speakerb74.###right.###speakera75.
88082:26	maybe i-, well, maybe that was, um,	maybe	###i don't know why.###speakera103.###did it really?###speakerb104.###yeah,###we di-,###there were three of us who *t*-1 went.###we were just all grou-, really grouchy when it was over *t*-1.###speakera105.###huh.###speakerb106.###so we decided 0 that may be the mark of a good film.###it made us think.###and so,###speakera107.###it made you think.###speakerb108.###we were grouchy.###we felt guilty for *-1 being,###speakera109.
88135:73	um, i rented a good movie, um, called * cinema paradeso which *t*-1 is an italian movie which *t*-3 is probably the best movie 0 i've seen *t*-2 ever.	probably	###yeah.###speakera125.###have you seen any other movies?###because you sound like you see a lot.###speakerb126.###well,###speakera127.###speakerb128.###righ-,###i do.###i'm just out of school###so i've seen, a lot of mo-,###speakera129.###oh, okay.###speakerb130.###* don't have a job###so i shouldn't go *-1 see movies all the time.###speakera131.###oh, there you go.###speakerb132.
88205:21	i'm guessing 0 you probably do.	probably	###but i was interested in *-1 reading texasville before i saw the movie.###speakera151.###yeah.###speakerb152.###did you like it?###speakera153.###um, i, i read a lot of larry mcmurtry books###speakerb154.###right.###speakera155.###and texasville is just like that.###it's like very peculiar circumstances and very peculiar things that people do *t*-1 with each other###speakerb156.###uh-huh.###speakera157.### it's, it's, you know,###and it's just sort of a,###speakera1.###okay.###uh, do you own a p c by the way?
88355:11	that's probably where you've used it *t*-1.	probably	###that was,###speakera55.###yeah.### have you ever used, do you use wordperfect ever? have you ever used wordperfect?###or,###speakerb56.###i haven't *?*.###that's the one that my father,###well, i guess 0 i have used it once or twice.###speakera57.###uh-huh.###speakerb58.###uh, it's the one that *t*-1's on my father-in-law's computer.###speakera59.###right.###speakerb60.###he's got on i b m.###speakera61.###yeah,###yeah.
88428:24	although i think 0 we've probably been talking at least ten minutes	probably	###speakera81.###yeah.###speakerb82.###speakera83.###yeah.###and i think about how it used *-1 to be *t*-3 if you were doing a paper and you had *-2 to go back and retype everything,###and oh, it was just awful.###so, um, i don't know 0 i think 0 we have just become really spoiled.###but i think, 0 it's a nice kind of way 0 * to be spoiled *t*-1.###speakerb84.###yeah.###speakera85.###speakerb86.###yeah,###i agree.###speakera87.###so, um, well, i have not really paid much attention because i###clock,###speakerb88.###speakera89.
88510:28	well, those are skills that she certainly w-, is going *-1 to need *t*-2 early on	certainly	###and they just talked to the other day other day about * setting something up again###so hopefully pretty soon we'll at least have the word processing.###speakera111.###uh-huh.###yeah.###speakerb112.###my nine year old i've decided *-1 to teach her how * to type * using the computer *t*-2,###speakera113.###good.###speakerb114.###so.###speakera115.###that's great.###speakerb116.###yeah.###speakera117.###yeah.###speakerb118.###i've,###speakera119.
88851:21	there were a hundred schools, probably there all competing for the same kids.	probably	###this school does.###so, uh, it's, it mumblex,###speakerb119.###huh.###speakera120.### i, i was involved in some, uh, oh, alumnae recruiting, uh, here in town, uh, recently, uh, well last year.###speakerb121.###uh-huh.###speakera122.###uh, and it was kind of fun, because you are trying * to to, trying *-1 to get people interested in your school, you know.###speakerb123.###uh-huh.###speakera124.###and they were,###this was a college night at a, at a high school in richardson.###and it was,###speakerb125.###uh-huh.###speakera126.###and there were a bunch of kids, you know, and a bunch of schools.
88886:51	but, uh, it seemed like there were quite a few kids that *t*-1 were definitely interested in *-2 going there.	definitely	###speakera134.###speakerb135.###um.###speakera136.###uh, you know, we, uh, mumblex###situations like that, you don't realize, you know, until you start *-1 thinking about it, the kinds of mumblex advantages 0 you school may have *t*-2 over others.###speakerb137.###uh-huh.###speakera138.###and so, i, i was real, real pleased with that.###that worked out so well.###speakerb139.###yeah.###so did you drum up any interest then###or, well, that's good.###speakera140.###i think so.###speakerb141.###speakera142.###i don't know offhand
88922:32	well you know i think 0 richardson is probably you know one of the places that *t*-1 would definitely	probably	###and she was she was, letting us know she, mumblex how, how good her daughter was *t*-1.###speakerb151.###speakera152.###she had cards printed * up, actually describing, you know, business cards describing her daughter's, uh, you know,###she had won several different twirling awards, and all this,###speakerb153.###oh, really.###speakera154.###speakerb155.###uh-huh.###speakera156.###and she was, had these business cards 0 she was passing *t*-1 out###and it was quite a production.###i think 0 some parents go a little bit overboard.###speakerb157.###yeah###it sounds like it.###speakera158.###yes.###speakerb159.
88922:67	well you know i think 0 richardson is probably you know one of the places that *t*-1 would definitely	definitely	###and she was she was, letting us know she, mumblex how, how good her daughter was *t*-1.###speakerb151.###speakera152.###she had cards printed * up, actually describing, you know, business cards describing her daughter's, uh, you know,###she had won several different twirling awards, and all this,###speakerb153.###oh, really.###speakera154.###speakerb155.###uh-huh.###speakera156.###and she was, had these business cards 0 she was passing *t*-1 out###and it was quite a production.###i think 0 some parents go a little bit overboard.###speakerb157.###yeah###it sounds like it.###speakera158.###yes.###speakerb159.
89266:12	and someday, maybe, we might even own it,	maybe	###speakera115.###no,###no,###no,###it was called *-1, uh, hard way, where he was an actor, trying * to portray trying *-2 to portray, portray a policeman *t*-3.###speakerb116.###oh, okay,###trying * to mumblex, yeah.###speakera117.###speakerb118.###speakera119.###and that,###speakerb1.###there you go *t*-1.###first question,###do you own your house?###speakera2.###uh, right,###well, we try.###i mean it's a big mortgage in the sky
89266:20	and someday, maybe, we might even own it,	might	###speakera115.###no,###no,###no,###it was called *-1, uh, hard way, where he was an actor, trying * to portray trying *-2 to portray, portray a policeman *t*-3.###speakerb116.###oh, okay,###trying * to mumblex, yeah.###speakera117.###speakerb118.###speakera119.###and that,###speakerb1.###there you go *t*-1.###first question,###do you own your house?###speakera2.###uh, right,###well, we try.###i mean it's a big mortgage in the sky
89286:30	before that we lived in garland, uh, probably about, you know, four blocks away.	probably	###and someday, maybe, we might even own it,###but, um, for all practical purposes, i guess 0 we hold the mortgage.###speakerb3.###our name is on the till,###speakera4.###yeah,###right.###speakerb5.###so that implies ownership.###speakera6.###no one else has offered *-1 to pay for it.###speakerb7.###that's right.###i would not object if anybody did.###speakera8.###yeah,###really they could move right into the spare room.###speakerb9.###yeah.###well, we have, we have had this one for five years now.
89300:13	it could not possibly have gone any lower	possibly	###speakera8.###yeah,###really they could move right into the spare room.###speakerb9.###yeah.###well, we have, we have had this one for five years now.###before that we lived in garland, uh, probably about, you know, four blocks away.###speakera10.###uh-huh.###speakerb11.###* liked the area, chose *-1 to stay inside of spring park.###it's a, uh,###i don't know if you have been up here,###but it is a residential homeowners, association.###speakera12.###right,###yeah,###speakerb13.###so, there's a lot of, you know, activities, a lot of pluses and common land.###but, uh, we thought 0 we were buying at the bottom of the market, you know,
89321:9	but, maybe not in your area,	maybe	###and so we were wrong.###speakera14.###oh, five years ago.###speakerb15.###yeah.###speakera16.###yeah,###speakerb17.###i think,###what,###it bottom out about a ye-, year later.###speakera18.###yeah,###it, well,###i mean just recently, i would say *t*-1,###i would give it two years back, when it was, i think 0 *t*-2, bottomed out *t*-1.###speakerb19.###oddly enough, two years, you know,### i, uh, i think that,###speakera20.
89427:29	so, i think 0 the high end is definitely, you know somewhere there.	definitely	###yeah,###and the guy around the corner is being transferred *-1###so he said, uh, well, 0 he did comparables that it's about eighty dollars,###* let's see what,###i don't remember if he said 0 it was sixty dollars a square foot, off the creek and eighty on the creek, or, if it was eighty and a hundred.###speakera52.###well yeah.###speakerb53.###speakera54.###speakerb55.###speakera56.###probably eighty.###speakerb57.###i think 0 it was sixty, eighty.###speakera58.###sixty, eighty.###speakerb59.###i think.###speakera60.###well because, i know 0 our, our little house over here stuck * in the middle of, you know, the subdivision is, i think fifty five,
89441:10	now, maybe, you know, that's pretty close to what it would have sold for *t*-1, uh, * brand new,	maybe	###speakera58.###sixty, eighty.###speakerb59.###i think.###speakera60.###well because, i know 0 our, our little house over here stuck * in the middle of, you know, the subdivision is, i think fifty five,###so, i think 0 the high end is definitely, you know somewhere there.###speakerb61.###well, * try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot.###no,###it could not be *?*,###because this house has around thirty four hundred square feet,###and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars.###speakera62.###yeah.###speakerb63.###just never.###speakera64.###well.###speakerb65.
89547:103	and, uh, the idea of * ever owning anything that *t*-1 has four thousand square feet in it, for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars, which *t*-2 is probably about what their equity *ich*-6 is *t*-3, that they got *t*-4 out of *-5 selling their house.	probably	###so, it's real, real shady.###but, that's one of the few things that *t*-1 really, uh, immediately pays back on return.###but, what i was going *-1 to tell you *t*-2, these perry homes back there,###speakera94.###yeah.###speakerb95.###when the people from m c i come down *t*-1###and they are, you know, they are used to the virginia area, metropolitan d c.###speakera96.###uh.###speakerb97.###my god, they come down here###and those houses, that, that *t*-1 look the colonial look what the,###speakera98.###* looks like the george town brownstone.###speakerb99.###right,###speakera100.###yeah.###speakerb101.
89568:18	he has no insulation, probably.	probably	###speakera102.###* must be a dream.###speakerb103.###speakera104.###yeah.###speakerb105.###because those things are selling like hot cakes.###but, one of the people that *t*-1 was living back there was telling me that there is his air conditioning bill, per month, last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars a month.###speakera106.###oh.###speakerb107.###and i thought,###speakera108.###i can't###mumblex,###speakerb109.###mumblex###and he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here *t*-1.###and i was thinking, well, you know, i know why your god damn bill is so high *t*-1,###speakera110.
89634:107	and, and, uh, my father bought this, uh, my stepfather bought this *-1 thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care *t*-2	might	###a concern of yours right now.###speakera6.###yes,###it is *?*.###speakerb7.### are, are they living independently, right now?###speakera8.###yes,###they are *?*.###speakerb9.###oh.###speakera10.###they are *?*.###speakerb11.###have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that?###speakera12.###not for them,### my, my mother and stepfather have, have, uh, set up an arrangement where they have a large home and, uh, two of my sisters and, and their families, one of them's husband and then all the children are living in this home *t*-1.###it's got a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms### and, and, uh, they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and kitchen.
89756:13	and he was definitely,	definitely	###speakerb47.###speakera48.###right.###well, i, this was just something that i was, i witnessed *t*-1 to.###speakerb49.###you happened,###speakera50.###speakerb51.###right.###speakera52.### and, and, uh, at no point did anybody from the nursing home come in.###and we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour.###speakerb53.###oh.###speakera54.###and, with just a curtain, of course, between us and, and, uh,###speakerb55.###right.###speakera56.### th-, they re-, revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth,
89946:77	and even, and even then he, he had a very good case for the fact 0 they probably just got lost *-1 and they ditched in the water.	probably	###speakerb28.###speakera29.###explained mumblex,###speakerb30.### and, you know. uh, and the rea-, reason 0 i was, mumblex picked it back up *t*-1 was in light of all the, uh, mumblex well when they found the, uh, the airplanes on the, in the atlantic, *-2 thinking 0 they were flight nineteen *t*-3.###and i don't know if you are familiar with that at all###but it's, uh,###flight nineteen was one of the, uh, was a, a collection of a flight of five navy adventures at the end of world war two. right after world war two,###and they were, they were lost *-1###and, uh,###speakera31.###supposedly scooped * up by the triangle.###speakerb32.###yeah,###they were *?*.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.### and so, and in the book, you know, even,###he wrote this book back in the seventies,
89948:20	and, uh, it's probably, you know, real close to what, you know, everyone is thinking *t*-1, now that, they just got turned *-2 around and could not find their way back.	probably	###explained mumblex,###speakerb30.### and, you know. uh, and the rea-, reason 0 i was, mumblex picked it back up *t*-1 was in light of all the, uh, mumblex well when they found the, uh, the airplanes on the, in the atlantic, *-2 thinking 0 they were flight nineteen *t*-3.###and i don't know if you are familiar with that at all###but it's, uh,###flight nineteen was one of the, uh, was a, a collection of a flight of five navy adventures at the end of world war two. right after world war two,###and they were, they were lost *-1###and, uh,###speakera31.###supposedly scooped * up by the triangle.###speakerb32.###yeah,###they were *?*.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.### and so, and in the book, you know, even,###he wrote this book back in the seventies,### and even, and even then he, he had a very good case for the fact 0 they probably just got lost *-1 and they ditched in the water.### and, uh, because he, he mentions, he, he goes through and brings out points from the navy's findings and so forth.
90017:71	and she had, before it actually got big, she sent me this book *-1 saying, you might like this,	might	###speakera51.###and i think 0 the last one 0 i read *t*-1 like that was scott thurow's###and that was presumed innocent.###speakerb52.###yes.###speakera53.###and i just really, really liked the way 0 he writes *t*-1.###it's just, incredible.###speakerb54.###yeah,###i read that, too.###i got it, uh, right, after it came out.###speakera55.###speakerb56.###my, uh, you know,###speakera57.###yeah.###speakerb58.###he was an, an assistant district attorney in chicago at, uh, and while he was writing the book,###and, uh, my sister-in-law lives in chicago,
90187:18	or is this something that maybe * learning phonetics,	maybe	###as a matter of fact, he's reading on level.###the problem was his spelling.###and, you know, in, in * watching the way 0 he has struggled *t*-1,###speakera24.###uh-huh.###speakerb25.###it's interesting, because i'm convinced 0 i have the same learning disability, or had, that *t*-1 was ignored *-2.###speakera26.###oh.###speakerb27.###and,###speakera28.###right,###so you worked, you learned how * to solve your problems on your own *t*-1.###speakerb29.###that's right.### and, and so it's, you know, it's not an intelligence problem.###it's just a problem with learning.###speakera30.### has, has he had this since kindergarten,
90351:18	i know 0 steven probably would not be accepted *-1 because he has a learning disability and, into a private school. and, um, which *t*-3 is, which *t*-2 is too bad.	probably	###really.###speakera88.###so i, i really hate that for them.### i, i, would rather 0 they not have that attitude,###speakerb89.###yeah.###speakera90.###but that's,###speakerb91.###well, when * comparing test scores *t*-1,###i know recently i was in a discussion###and they were comparing test scores between private schools and public schools,###speakera92.###right.###speakerb93.###and that was one of the points that i made *t*-1, is that you're not comparing apples to apples.###speakera94.###that's right.###speakerb95.###you know, you can't say, um, you know,
90388:117	the, in fact, they've had cases *ich*-1 in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten, which *t*-2 means 0 they probably won't get into the top elementary and, and high school *t*-3,	probably	###and they ca-, they,###that's right,###they have the ability * to be selective.###but you can't say then, well, public schools are, are not as good.###speakera104.###right.###speakerb105.###perhaps they are *?*, because they're, they're,###speakera106.###if you choose the select top group out of the public schools and tested them, and then compared them to the pri-, to the private school group, then i think 0 you would have a more equitable way.###speakerb107.###you're right.###speakera108.###and i have a problem when they compare the kids in japan or germany to the kids here *t*-1.### in, in, in, uh, ho-, honesty, the kids in japan are, they have *-1 to try out *-3 to even get into, to which kindergarten they're going *-2 to get into *t*-4,###speakerb109.###oh, really?###speakera110.###and then after, uh,###and if, if you only,
90445:8	we certainly didn't carpool and run the way 0 i do *t*-1.	certainly	###but on the other hand, i feel like my children, who *t*-1 are kind of middle of the road, have, are more rounded, you know.###speakera126.###better coping skills.###speakerb127.###speakera128.###yes.###speakerb129.###sure,###sure,###i think 0 it *exp*-1's real important * to have friends.###i think 0 it *exp*-1's real important * to play sports.###i think 0 it *exp*-1's real important * to be part of a team.###speakera130.###right.###speakerb131.###and so that's why i said, 0 their childhood is extremely different from mine *t*-1.###we didn't do all that you know.###speakera132.###right.###speakerb133.
90636:44	is that just family's lack of priority, anymore, maybe	maybe	###you know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up *t*-1, uh, you know, they were all located *-2 together, in one small community.###speakera52.###right,###right.###speakerb53.###speakera54.###right.###speakerb55.###and as, as time grew, i mean when time went on *t*-1 the family grew and moved away and so forth.###and now when they come together *t*-1 it's, it's generally, you know,###like say the kids of those people who *t*-1 are not, you know, anywhere near one another###and i do not think 0 they feel the, the closeness that they *t*-3 used *-4 to be there. which *t*-2 is a shame###speakera56.###uh-huh.###speakerb57.###but that's just how it is *t*-1.###my mother was complaining last year about th-, you know,###it's dwindling down every year,###you know, that's just, i think 0 that's just,###speakera58.
90771:10	so you probably could give some great advice.	probably	###and that's as far as it got *?*.###i sent it, on to the next one,###speakerb99.###yeah.###speakera100.### and, and, but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one, in scottsdale, arizona, for that family.###speakerb101.###uh-huh.###speakera102.###we are real glad 0 we got together because since that, that time there were only like two of the, one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left *.###and the sister-in-law died###and the sister is in a nursing home,###so, we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago.###speakera1.###well, steve, did you go to college?###speakerb2.###yeah.###in fact, i'm still going.###speakera3.###oh, that's good.
90828:30	i think 0 that's more important *ich*-1 probably than even the career vocation, because most people change.	probably	###speakera19.###yeah.###speakerb20.###well, you know, the thing is, 0 when you're a kid *t*-2###and the kid at that age, especially if they're going into undergraduate, it seems like they think 0 they know what they want *t*-1.###speakera21.###uh-huh.###speakerb22.###speakera23.###yeah.###speakerb24.### an, and, i mean, * choosing from my experience, you know, i thought, you know, 0 my, i know what i want *t*-2 a lot more than my parents know what i want *t*-1.###speakera25.###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###but, uh, i don't know,###at the same time, you have *-1 to decide what *t*-2 is important about the school,###you know, the size of it or,###speakera27.###yeah.
90836:168	i, i think 0 i'd, i'd advise a parent *-1 to send a kid to a school *ich*-2, though, that *t*-3 has a number of different types of programs, you know, that, uh, some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer *t*-1,	might	###speakera23.###yeah.###speakerb24.### an, and, i mean, * choosing from my experience, you know, i thought, you know, 0 my, i know what i want *t*-2 a lot more than my parents know what i want *t*-1.###speakera25.###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###but, uh, i don't know,###at the same time, you have *-1 to decide what *t*-2 is important about the school,###you know, the size of it or,###speakera27.###yeah.###i think 0 that's more important *ich*-1 probably than even the career vocation, because most people change.###speakerb28.###yeah.###speakera29.### i kn-, i know very few people that, uh, *t*-1 started in one field and stayed with it.###you know, they,###i think 0 that's what you just said *t*-1, you know, * having * to do more with the size of the school, the environment of the school, uh,###i think 0 that's much more important.
90862:38	i, i think 0 most employers would probably rather *ich*-1 hire, you know, a, a three six in, um, in history, uh, * to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration.	probably	###or they don't have *-1 to, uh, uh,###i don't know,###they don't have *-1 to give up years of, you know, of credit transfer and things.###speakerb32.###yeah.###that's disruptive.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###speakera35.###i normally,### and, and parents hate *-1 to hear this, you know,###because i, i actually teach college,### i hate *-1 to, uh, i hate *-2 to talk to the parents### because, um one of the reasons is because, you know, the kid doesn't know exactly what they want *t*-1,###and i always say * make * sure 0 you major, in something that you like *t*-1, even if it's not going *-2 to be your career vocation, because you'll get better grades.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###speakerb38.###speakera39.
90913:52	and i think 0 the kids are a little bit more challenged, because their parents are probably college educated, where at the public school, i don't think 0 as many parents are public, are, are college educated,	probably	###would you, uh, advise a private school, or a public school,###speakera51.### i would, i would, it would,###speakerb52.###you know, what's the trade off *t*-1 there,###what,###speakera53.### i, i tell you,###i live in maryland,###and the public schools here are, pretty good.###speakerb54.###speakera55.###i teach at a public school, actually,###and i know that the s a t scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than a lot of the public sch-, a lot of the private schools.###and, um, i actually, i would full time at a, at a public school,###and then right now i'm teaching part time at a private school, at a catholic institution.###speakerb56.###oh, i see.###speakera57.### and, um, and i really think, i think 0 i'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school, because i think 0 their parents pay more,
90933:22	you know, a particular institution might be better for my area	might	###and i think 0 the kids are a little bit more challenged, because their parents are probably college educated, where at the public school, i don't think 0 as many parents are public, are, are college educated,###and i don't, i think 0 because it costs less, the kid doesn't take it quite as serious, you know,### they're not, th-,### it, it's the minimal cost.###but i think 0 you can get a good education at public or private###but i think 0 you can also get a bad education at public or private, you know,###i###speakerb58.###yeah.###speakera59.### you have *-1 to really, you have *-2 to look around at the school.### i, i think 0 the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what * to look for *t*-1.###speakerb60.###yeah,###yeah.###i think, uh, 0 i would agree with that.###in fact, the thing that, i'm going through the same thing, where in graduate school, i was trying *-1 to choose.###speakera61.###uh-huh.###speakerb62.
90940:66	yet, like, say, you know, the university of small town in arkansas or something, might have some top specialists in my area.	might	###speakerb58.###yeah.###speakera59.### you have *-1 to really, you have *-2 to look around at the school.### i, i think 0 the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what * to look for *t*-1.###speakerb60.###yeah,###yeah.###i think, uh, 0 i would agree with that.###in fact, the thing that, i'm going through the same thing, where in graduate school, i was trying *-1 to choose.###speakera61.###uh-huh.###speakerb62.###you know, a particular institution might be better for my area###speakera63.###right.###speakerb64.###speakera65.###uh-huh.###speakerb66.
90947:108	yet, if i go to u of i or c m u or, you know, some, you know, any big name school, my quality of education might not be that much better,	might	###yeah.###i think, uh, 0 i would agree with that.###in fact, the thing that, i'm going through the same thing, where in graduate school, i was trying *-1 to choose.###speakera61.###uh-huh.###speakerb62.###you know, a particular institution might be better for my area###speakera63.###right.###speakerb64.###speakera65.###uh-huh.###speakerb66.### yet, like, say, you know, the university of small town in arkansas or something, might have some top specialists in my area.###speakera67.###uh-huh.###speakerb68.###speakera69.###right.###speakerb70.
91243:63	i read a book that i have, should have read *t*-1 when i was probably in high school *t*-2.	probably	###speakerb66.###so anyway,###speakera67.###yeah.###speakerb68.###but that's the last thing 0 i, i've read *t*-1,###speakera69.###yeah.###speakerb70.###and, um,###speakera71.###well, it's,###i'm trying *-1 to think the last actual book 0 i read *t*-2 that *t*-3 wasn't,###* let's see,###i think 0 i read, oh,###when i was on vacation, um, between semester break and summer, you know, on semester break between spring and summer *t*-1###speakerb72.###yeah.###speakera73.###and i went to my mother's,
91421:25	and they just went from generation, probably to generation, just with these, with these all passing it from one to the other.	probably	###oh, it's a brand new book.###speakera135.###yeah,###uh-huh.###speakerb136.###oh, that, that would be wonderful * to read something like that.###speakera137.###yeah,###speakerb138.###speakera139.###and he really, this man really shed some light on, um, some, aspects of of bach's genius and, and, and, you know, the, and more sociological things, you know, like the, the idea that, um, that music, * to be a musician was as much, um, of a family occupation as anything.###speakerb140.###yeah.###speakera141.###i mean, you know, that was it was families had just loads of musicians.###speakerb142.###yes.###speakera143.###speakerb144.###yeah,
91449:50	um, and i'm supposed *-1 to decide whether i think 0 this man might be a worthy person 0 *t*-2 to be a, you know, in that position on the board	might	###yes,###uh-huh,###and, um,###speakerb150.###yeah,###that's the way 0 it was *t*-1, i'm sure 0 *t*-2 back then.###speakera151.###yeah.###so, uh,###speakerb152.###yeah.###oh, that's interesting.###speakera153.###it was just really interesting,###if that's, you know, that's kind of what,###but i have *-1 to###not only am, am i re-, reading it *-2 to decide whether or not it should be reviewed *-1, but also, um, because the board of advisers for this, um, journal doesn't have, right now doesn't have a really respected name, um, who *t*-3's a, uh, a scholar on, on music,###speakerb154.###uh-huh.###speakera155.
91480:21	i think 0 that's probably a, sort of a thing 0 * to do *t*-1 in small colleges,	probably	###that's real rough.###speakera161.###so, um, it's real interesting.###speakerb162.###yeah.###speakera163.###speakerb164.###well, that's a neat thing 0 * to be involved *-1 in *t*-2.###because i think 0 our, i think 0 my alma mater, um, gettysburg, i think 0 they were just starting a magazine that *t*-3 was similar to that.###speakera165.###yeah,###it is.###speakerb166.###speakera167.###uh-huh.###speakerb168.###speakera169.###yeah,###yeah.###speakerb170.
91596:13	well, it might be a good time for you to be-, to, to start a tradition.	might	###on my father's side we've really there, uh,###speakerb5.###uh-huh.###speakera6.###on my mother's side we've had several,### not, it's not really on a regular basis,###speakerb7.###uh-huh.###speakera8.###but usually sometimes every few summers.###well, all, see, all the family lives in once place, except for a few of us are scattered about.###speakerb9.###right.###speakera10.###so they're pretty much just reunited always###speakerb11.###uh-huh.###speakera12.###so it's, it's just once in a while 0 we get the special gathering with everyone together *t*-1.###speakerb13.
91687:46	well, we try *-1 to stay away from those things which *t*-2 might have, uh, salmonella in them.	might	###so it would be the second great grandchild.###and so they,###speakera44.###okay,###so this town hall that you meet in *t*-1, is that like a, um,###speakerb45.###well, it's a community center, it's a community hall.###it's, a great big open building that *t*-1 has a wonderful kitchen it in,###speakera46.###okay.###speakerb47.###and, uh, you just bring the covered dishes.### every, every family brings a, a dish of some kind,###and you get all the wonderful old family recipes, that *t*-1 have been handed *, down for years.###speakera48.###mumblex.###speakerb49.###speakera50.###potato salad and, uh,###speakerb51.
91861:66	we had, uh, the first reunion, or the first, you know, major reunion was probably six or seven years ago.	probably	###and so they came *-1 to support her,###and then one by one, his broth-, you know, his sisters, he began *-1 to lose family members,###speakera106.###see, that's### we've we had a problem with that.###speakerb107.###and it *ich*-1 was difficult * to hold them together.###and then, of course, he died two years ago,###so, you know, that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now.###speakera108.###oh.###speakerb109.###and, uh, it,###i think 0 that's what *t*-1 happens when they get scattered *t*-2,### the, the family unit, you know, falls, into disrepair.###speakera110.###right.### that's our, was our problem.###speakerb111.###speakera112.
91865:31	and then the second reunion, people who *t*-1 maybe, you know, had sacrificed things * to come to the first one thought, oh, well, it's not that big a thing this year,	maybe	### we've we had a problem with that.###speakerb107.###and it *ich*-1 was difficult * to hold them together.###and then, of course, he died two years ago,###so, you know, that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now.###speakera108.###oh.###speakerb109.###and, uh, it,###i think 0 that's what *t*-1 happens when they get scattered *t*-2,### the, the family unit, you know, falls, into disrepair.###speakera110.###right.### that's our, was our problem.###speakerb111.###speakera112.### we had, uh, the first reunion, or the first, you know, major reunion was probably six or seven years ago.###speakerb113.###uh-huh.###speakera114.
91907:10	so you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot?	probably	###speakerb3.###recently,###my most recent trip was last year,###and that was detroit.###speakera4.###detroit?###speakerb5.###yeah.###speakera6.###is that a nice vacation spot?###speakerb7.###well, it wasn't really *?*.###it was, um, uh, * to see an old relative.###speakera8.###right,###okay.###speakerb9.###and it was, uh, just * to, uh, have some fellowship with her.###speakera10.###right.
91957:13	so that's probably my favorite place when i have *-1 to go somewhere on a vacation *t*-2.	probably	###speakerb23.###uh-huh.###speakera24.###speakerb25.###yes.###speakera26.###speakerb27.###oh, that's always refreshing 0 * to get away from *t*-1.###speakera28.###so it's a lot of fun.###i worked up there last summer,###so i guess 0 it was kind of like a vacation the, whole summer long.###speakerb29.###oh, well, that's nice.###speakera30.###speakerb31.###yeah.###speakera32.###* worked at a camp there,###and so i got *-1 to spend a lot of time up in the mountains.
92053:11	i'm probably going back there *-1 to work, for a year.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakera64.###and then i went to england a few years ago.###speakerb65.###oh, that's exciting.###speakera66.###i was a, student there and spent, um, a semester *-1 studying abroad in london.###speakerb67.###uh-huh.###speakera68.###speakerb69.###uh-huh.###speakera70.###and that was a great time, because it's so, that's such a neat place###and it's, there's not a language barrier###so you don't,###i mean, there there's a little bit, because there's some of those english words that you just don't exactly know what they mean *t*-1 *t*-2,###and a lot of people have trouble *-1 wrestling with their accents,###but it's, it was really fun.### i, i, i really enjoyed that.
92058:87	well, i had a friend that, uh, *t*-1 visited england not, well, i think 0 it's been *ich*-2 probably two years now,	probably	###speakera66.###i was a, student there and spent, um, a semester *-1 studying abroad in london.###speakerb67.###uh-huh.###speakera68.###speakerb69.###uh-huh.###speakera70.###and that was a great time, because it's so, that's such a neat place###and it's, there's not a language barrier###so you don't,###i mean, there there's a little bit, because there's some of those english words that you just don't exactly know what they mean *t*-1 *t*-2,###and a lot of people have trouble *-1 wrestling with their accents,###but it's, it was really fun.### i, i, i really enjoyed that.###i'm probably going back there *-1 to work, for a year.###speakerb71.###uh-huh.###speakera72.###speakerb73.
92307:40	it looks like, it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things. where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show *t*-1.	might	###oh, well. well...###speakera21.###so we don't watch, uh, that type of show,###but we like l a law.###we like, that.###speakerb22.###uh-huh.###speakera23.###we're just,###i'm sorry 0 they're breaking the team up, because we liked all the ones that *t*-1 were on there.###speakerb24.###i know.###i'm amazed.###speakera25.###i'm not sure 0 i like the new ones too much.###speakerb26.###huh-uh.### i'm surprised that, i was surprised at the ending of, you know, with all the funny things happening and different things.###speakera27.###i just wonder if, if, uh, they just want *-1 to go on to other projects and not be stuck *-2 in this show, since it's gone on for so long,
92388:10	and robots probably.	probably	###that type of show is what we what, uh, we watch *t*-1.###speakerb54.###uh-huh.###speakera55.###we generally just stay on one channel all, for all of monday night, just *-1 to watch those.###just some of the times they're continued *-1,###but mostly they're just little vignettes.###a new one 0 we found *t*-1 0 we really like *t*-2 is that dinosaurs.###have you seen that?###speakerb56.###huh-uh.###speakera57.### that is, it's, it's really funny.###they use like animated,###it's not like a cartoon,###but it's like dummies and things, that *t*-1 are used *-2,###speakerb58.###uh-huh.###speakera59.###and, uh, it's really, um,
92491:17	and i guess 0 maybe there are some parts of that,	maybe	###and,###speakerb88.###it's just a half hour,###or is it hour?###speakera89.###well, half hour.###speakerb90.###oh.###speakera91.### that, that's all 0 there is *t*-1 to it.### and, and, uh, they...###speakerb92.###there's not many half hour shows,###it seems like that,###speakera93.###yeah,### it, it, they, they're trying *-1 to liken the, the father in there of the teenage son *ich*-3 to like jackie gleason show. uh, the way 0 he talks to his mother-in-law *t*-2 and so forth,###speakerb94.###uh-huh.###speakera95.
92598:5	maybe you saw in the paper this morning that, um, they've had some problems with, the recycling on plastic,	maybe	###speakera123.###yeah.###my oldest grandson pulling his tooth.### he's, he's, he wouldn't let us pull it,###speakerb124.###how funny.###speakera125.###and i mean, it, it got to the point 0 he was eating a pear here, and he bit into it, and it was just hanging by a thread *t*-1.### and i, and i'd tell him, you know, it's getting ready *-1 to fall out,###and he walked around the house with his fa-, face down toward the floor and his mouth open, *-1 hoping 0 it would fall out, because he wouldn't let anybody pull it.###speakerb126.###speakera127.###and he wou-, he wound up *-1 pull,###speakera1.###yes, um,### i, i think that plano has really done a fantastic job.###i mean, at least their plans have, are good.###um, how-, however, i was,###speakerb2.###speakera3.
92638:16	i was probably, this was probably,	probably	###speakerb14.### and, and, uh, i, it *exp*-1's too bad that people have *-2 to ruin, a good part thing.###speakera15.###yeah.###speakerb16.###speakera17.###i guess 0 that's going *-1 to happen.###speakerb18.###speakera19.###yeah,###speakerb20.###speakera21.###a really good effort,###that's right,###yeah.###speakerb22.###but, uh,###speakera23.###well, i was thinking about the other day, um,### when i, when dick and i were, oh, many, many years ago when we were first married and he was in graduate school in missouri *t*-1, um, i went, oh,
92638:30	i was probably, this was probably,	probably	###speakerb14.### and, and, uh, i, it *exp*-1's too bad that people have *-2 to ruin, a good part thing.###speakera15.###yeah.###speakerb16.###speakera17.###i guess 0 that's going *-1 to happen.###speakerb18.###speakera19.###yeah,###speakerb20.###speakera21.###a really good effort,###that's right,###yeah.###speakerb22.###but, uh,###speakera23.###well, i was thinking about the other day, um,### when i, when dick and i were, oh, many, many years ago when we were first married and he was in graduate school in missouri *t*-1, um, i went, oh,
92746:7	so maybe we don't realize it in our lifetime,	maybe	###and,###speakera57.###people, 0 i don't know *t*-1, they find fault in everything, rather than say 0 this is a good effort.###speakerb58.###rather than * work with it.###speakera59.###yeah.###speakerb60.###yeah.###speakera61.###i don't know.### it's, it's,### i under-, i know what you're saying *t*-1,###kind of people like that###and, well, sure it is *?*.###speakerb62.###well, it's for everybody's benefit.###speakera63.###speakerb64.###i mean, it's, it's not,
92971:27	i wonder if, you know, maybe i need *-1 to bring that to someone's attention, you know,	maybe	###speakerb154.###uh-huh.###speakera155.###and, um, i don't know,### it's, uh, it *exp*-5's just really interesting to me how now more aware of things *ich*-4 i am *t*-2 *t*-1 than i, even myself, than i used *-3 to be *?*, a few years ago.###speakerb156.###right.###speakera157.###i mean, like i, i'd go to the, um, to the u t d, um, cafeteria for lunch sometimes###speakerb158.###uh-huh.###speakera159.###and they use styrofoam plates, when they wouldn't, need *-1 to use styrofoam plates *t*-2.###speakerb160.###um.###speakera161.###speakerb162.###right.###speakera163.###you know, and i think to myself that's, that's crazy.
93101:10	and we probably take one of each every year.	probably	###beautiful country,###speakerb25.###and it was,###speakera26.###beautiful people.###speakerb27.###yeah,###it,###speakera28.###but, uh,###and i'd real, really like *-1 to go because, um, i'm fairly recently married###speakerb29.###we had a great time.###speakera30.### and, and my husband has been hearing about these people for years### and, uh, but he's never met them,###so, uh, i'd like, i'd like *-1 to do that.###but anyway, that's, that's our typical vacation,###and, uh, we enjoy the family vacations,###but the other ones are very special getaways,
93240:26	we, we'd probably go.	probably	###i really came *-1 to love san diego and feel very, comfortable there.###speakerb73.###speakera74.###they've been there eight years.###speakerb75.###uh-huh.###speakera76.###and, uh, you know, i just grab the car and drive everywhere.###speakerb77.###oh, that's great.###speakera78.###so it, it is, it is nice,###but it's not home.###this is home,### and, um, and i've never thought about a cruise.###it's so funny.###speakerb79.###oh, they, they, they really are.### we've, yeah, as i said, we've done them three times.###we'd be going again this, this year if circumstances hadn't changed.
93377:27	huh. well, may, maybe now 0 things are calming down again. that will happen.	maybe	###so they took some time off that, uh, they could show us around.###and it, it is a beautiful country.###speakera124.###huh.###speakerb125.###it is beautiful.###they have mountains.###we were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore.###speakera126.###that's really nice.###speakerb127.###and it, it is gorgeous.###they live in a small town called * david, which *t*-1 is northern panama up near costa rica.###speakera128.###uh-huh.###speakerb129.###and, uh, it's, it's just, it's just a gorgeous country.###most people don't realize it.###i think 0 if they could get tourists coming to their country, they'd improve the economy considerably.###speakera130.
93425:17	not every morning, it probably averages about two days a week	probably	###speakera1.###all right, do you do exercise?###speakerb2.###i do,###yes,### i, uh, uh, i guess 0 it actually changes,###i do a number of different things simply *-1 walking with my wife###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.###speakera5.###right.###speakerb6.###and sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle.###speakera7.###speakerb8.###uh, and then * moving up, i run in the mornings,###speakera9.###uh-huh###speakerb10.
93487:36	so, i'm thirty-two years old which *t*-1 is probably different than yourself	probably	###that's kind of the same thing for me.###i have *-1 to not know that it's exercise so i can do it.###speakerb28.###right.###so you look at it more as a task.###speakera29.###well, yeah,###if it's exercise, it's a task.###speakerb30.###right.###speakera31.###i don't want *-1 to do anything 0 i have *-2 to do *t*-3.###speakerb32.###i see.###speakera33.###i mean, i'll voluntarily clean the bathroom,###but i won't do it if i have *-1 to do it.###speakerb34.###right,###right.
93563:52	so, running, i, i'm at that point which you probably get to *t*-1 after about six months of dedicated running where you don't feel your muscles any more *t*-2	probably	###right.###speakerb58.###i do that at the end of the day,###and it takes, you know,### that, that during that time the stress from the day goes away.###i get *-1 to share whatever i did *t*-2 with my wife, and, and vice versa.###speakera59.###right.###speakerb60.###* going to the gym is, is actually something different than, than, like,###oh, and the running,###and i enjoy that too.###speakera61.###uh-huh###speakerb62.###year,###i've been running since high school on track teams and the like,###speakera63.###oh.###speakerb64.

93942:60	i guess 0 they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant *t*-1 maybe.	maybe	###gosh,###speakerb62.###speakera63.###oh, that's good,###that's good,###or it's always good on top of something in the sandwich.###speakerb64.###yeah,###yeah.###speakera65.###oh, well, we made, i made guacamole that i would take *t*-1 to a pool party across the street the other day,### and, and everyone there said 0 they never made guacamole salad.###speakerb66.###what you want *t*-1.### wh-, where do they get it *t*-1?.###speakera67.###well, i don't know,###i guess 0 they don't have it at home,###speakerb68.###i can't imagine 0 it would stay fresh long enough * to,
93974:15	i thought 0 maybe that was the trick.	maybe	###oh, does that help?###speakerb74.###yeah,###if you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing, especially while you're waiting before you serve it.###speakera75.###okay,###well,###speakerb76.###that's supposed *-1 to help * keep the, um, keep it from *-2 turning brown so quick.###speakera77.###well, i'll have *-1 to remember that.###well, i just, i, that day i just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top###and it really stayed longer than i ever thought 0 it would *?*,###speakerb78.###oh.###speakera79.###so.###speakerb80.###oh, that's good.###speakera81.
93976:8	that probably helps, too.	probably	###yeah,###if you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing, especially while you're waiting before you serve it.###speakera75.###okay,###well,###speakerb76.###that's supposed *-1 to help * keep the, um, keep it from *-2 turning brown so quick.###speakera77.###well, i'll have *-1 to remember that.###well, i just, i, that day i just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top###and it really stayed longer than i ever thought 0 it would *?*,###speakerb78.###oh.###speakera79.###so.###speakerb80.###oh, that's good.###speakera81.###i thought 0 maybe that was the trick.###speakerb82.
94039:26	well, i guess 0 that's probably all 0 we need *-1 to do *t*-2 for tonight.	probably	###speakera99.###or in,###speakerb100.###i don't think 0 mine know either.###in fact, we've been getting lunch meat that *t*-1's turkey, too.###it costs less than the other,###i don't know,###there's supposed *-1 to be something more healthy about it.###speakera101.###yeah,###yeah.###speakerb102.###poultry instead of the beef and pork,###speakera103.### less cho-, less cholesterol. yeah,###speakerb104.###yeah.###speakera105.###right,###right.
94059:17	probably, probably the only family recipe that we, we make *t*-1 and it's really for special occasions is cheese cake,	probably	###well, i guess 0 that's probably all 0 we need *-1 to do *t*-2 for tonight.###speakerb106.###yeah,### i, i can't think of any other specific things 0 i like *-1 to serve *t*-2.###um,###speakera107.###i always like dessert.###speakerb108.###one salad that we always like *t*-1, my sister-in-law always brings *t*-1 to family dinners, is a,###i don't know what you call it *t*-1.###uh, you mix, um, cottage cheese and a package of jello and a thing of, uh, like cool whip###speakera109.###right,###right###speakerb110.###that's good and quick and easy,###speakera111.###that's always good,###speakerb112.###speakera113.
94064:11	it's probably fairly typical,	probably	###speakera107.###i always like dessert.###speakerb108.###one salad that we always like *t*-1, my sister-in-law always brings *t*-1 to family dinners, is a,###i don't know what you call it *t*-1.###uh, you mix, um, cottage cheese and a package of jello and a thing of, uh, like cool whip###speakera109.###right,###right###speakerb110.###that's good and quick and easy,###speakera111.###that's always good,###speakerb112.###speakera113.### probably, probably the only family recipe that we, we make *t*-1 and it's really for special occasions is cheese cake,###and we take a recipe from my grandmother, you know###speakerb114.###uh-huh.###speakera115.
94167:30	well, i guess, um, 0 ours probably isn't that big.	probably	###and, uh, everyone, uh, they get the community building there at lake texoma lodge,###and everyone brings in food###speakerb36.###uh-huh.###speakera37.###and then for the saturday night dinner they bring in like kentucky fried chicken from durant,###and uh it really, uh, has worked out.###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###speakera39.###speakerb40.###how many people, jim, *t*-1 are involved?###speakera41.###uh, generally, uh, i think 0 *t*-1 it's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people.###speakerb42.###wow.###speakera43.###i think 0 normal's about sixty or seventy.###speakerb44.###yeah,
94436:99	and, uh uh, i think that that part of that showing up now, you know, with, with things because kids i think have probably less respect than for, for people than in, in other things, than we may have seen in the past, uh,	probably	###speakerb10.###uh, well, the values, more or less at home and the t v, just a general,###i mean, learning is not a revered endeavor, really,###i mean, it's a lot more,###it's socially, well i won't say *rnr*-1 socially unacceptable,###but whereas like in, uh, a person that, uh, *t*-1 stud-,###they put a lot more emphasis on athletics###and things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society,###and i think 0 that carries over to school a lot.###speakera11.###right.###speakerb12.###so.###speakera13.###yeah,### i, i, i, i think that the biggest problem is, uh, with the, uh, with the home environment being part of it.###you know, if,###i think 0 too many parents expect, uh, the school to teach, uh, the moral aspects of, of things to the st-, to the kids and, you know, while we're not going *-1 to worry about, uh, *-2 teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that, you know, and then expect them to pick it up at school,###you're not going *-1 to do that, you know,###you're going *-2 to carry, carry with, carry to school, uh, out into the world, you know, what you learned *t*-1 at home,
94471:89	you look at the schools like that where you've got a lot of kids who *t*-1 are basically, uh, that *t*-2 might be more well to-, well off, you know, going to a private catholic school or whatever *t*-3, uh,	might	###do you get the,###oh, that's kind of side tracked,###but, uh, i just remember *-1 seeing on the news the other night, 0 they had the thing about how catholic schools are doing so much better *t*-2###speakera17.###uh-huh.###speakerb18.###i thought, well, you know, of course they're doing better,###and not so much when i was growing up *t*-1, catholic schools are generally considered *-1 a little bit easier than the public schools,###but, uh, they still had a, a better success rate, simply because they started with a lot better raw material.###i mean everybody that *t*-1 went to a catholic school had, uh, at least the parents did, at least, had education as a priority like you said and kind of had a whole conducive atmosphere to it.###speakera19.###right,###speakerb20.###speakera21.###right.###speakerb22.###and i wonder if, not so much that, uh,###speakera23.###well, i think 0 it's, like you say, it's, it's the socioeconomic mix### there, you know, the, they're,
94492:14	and, uh, maybe they pick up on that.	maybe	### and, and they're not all that way,###but, you know, some that *t*-1 are *?* um, that, they're, they're not quite the same as the kids that *t*-2 are going to the inner city, uh, you know, public schools.###speakerb24.###yeah.###speakera25.###speakerb26.###yeah,###this is interesting because in my mind i don't have the stereotype of a catholic school being a suburban kind of environment,###but, uh, this, this was actually inner city###speakera27.###yeah.###speakerb28.###people were sending,###i mean, just because their kids had the ability and the, and the drive *-1 to do, try and get an education, they didn't send him to a public school, you know,###like you said, you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you're pressured *-1 not to learn *t*-2 in instance,###speakera29.###yeah,###well, you know, in a lot of cases like that, where, you know, if kids are going to a public parochial school like that, it's, it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education.### it shows, i think 0 it shows that the parents have some, uh, desire for, for the kid to do, do well, you know,###and that may be passed *-1 on down to the kid as well,
94496:27	and then from the other aspect, um, maybe the, uh, school itself has, has, has more emphasis on, uh, *-1 trying *-2 to do a good job because the classes may be smaller, uh,	maybe	###speakera25.###speakerb26.###yeah,###this is interesting because in my mind i don't have the stereotype of a catholic school being a suburban kind of environment,###but, uh, this, this was actually inner city###speakera27.###yeah.###speakerb28.###people were sending,###i mean, just because their kids had the ability and the, and the drive *-1 to do, try and get an education, they didn't send him to a public school, you know,###like you said, you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you're pressured *-1 not to learn *t*-2 in instance,###speakera29.###yeah,###well, you know, in a lot of cases like that, where, you know, if kids are going to a public parochial school like that, it's, it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education.### it shows, i think 0 it shows that the parents have some, uh, desire for, for the kid to do, do well, you know,###and that may be passed *-1 on down to the kid as well,###and, uh, maybe they pick up on that.###speakerb30.###yeah.###speakera31.
94622:232	* seeing the children in the school the way 0 i do *t*-1, i, i mean, i see the ones that, we can always tell the ones that *t*-2 have not been around children at all when they come in as three year olds *t*-6 as opposed to the ones that *t*-3 have been in the program, that *t*-4 started at twelve months maybe, and were were even in there one day a week which *t*-5 is all 0 our school provides *t*-7 for the, you know for the under three year olds	maybe	###speakerb28.###however in today's environment it *exp*-3 may be more critical * to have the ability 0 * to interact in large groups, simply because that's the way 0 our young people are, are dealt *-1 with *t*-2 *t*-4.###speakera29.###yeah.###speakerb30.###speakera31.###uh-huh.###speakerb32.###speakera33.###yeah,###in other words, there're more people,###speakerb34.###they're dealt *-1 with, in packages.###speakera35.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###yes,###yes.### that's, that's an interesting point of view.###i, uh, you know,
94678:12	that *t*-1 maybe,	maybe	###i recently stopped by mcdonalds,###and i was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things, and was visiting with another mother who *t*-1 was there with her children,###and she was telling me that she was given *-1 the opportunity 0 * to manage a day care center *t*-2,###and of course, she was, she had just gotten her degree,###and she was so enthusiastic,###and she was excited about it###and she was going *-1 to accomplish all of these things###speakera59.###yes,###yes,###speakerb60.###however, uh, when it came to * hiring and staffing people who *t*-1 cared and who *t*-2 were willing *-3 to take care of those children and spend that kind of time *t*-4, the pay is minimal###speakera61.###yes,###it is *?*.###speakerb62.###and it takes people with total and complete dedication who *t*-1 really don't want *-2 to make a living for themselves in order * to be in that environment,###speakera63.###yes,###that's right,
94682:13	that *t*-2 maybe have another salary in their family that, where they can do that *t*-1,	maybe	###and she was so enthusiastic,###and she was excited about it###and she was going *-1 to accomplish all of these things###speakera59.###yes,###yes,###speakerb60.###however, uh, when it came to * hiring and staffing people who *t*-1 cared and who *t*-2 were willing *-3 to take care of those children and spend that kind of time *t*-4, the pay is minimal###speakera61.###yes,###it is *?*.###speakerb62.###and it takes people with total and complete dedication who *t*-1 really don't want *-2 to make a living for themselves in order * to be in that environment,###speakera63.###yes,###that's right,###that *t*-1 maybe,###speakerb64.###speakera65.###yeah,
94985:16	three eight six twenty-five c maybe	maybe	###no.###um, i, actually i'm doing consulting right now because i just had a baby,###and my husband's working at bell labs,###but he's really from france,###and these computers actually are from france.###speakerb14.###what brand are they *t*-1?###speakera15.###one of them's a compaq###speakerb16.###uh-huh.###speakera17.###it's a three eighty-six###speakerb18.###i'm jealous.###speakera19.###and the other is actually a i b m p c compatible,###it's a three eighty-six,###i guess 0 it's twenty-five,###yeah,
95177:16	well, it's probably the granddaddy of most, uh, data base management systems.	probably	###um, i haven't done much lotus work connected * with my job.###i've been through three classes###speakera79.###uh-huh.###speakerb80.###and i have a great deal of respect for it.###speakera81.###uh-huh.###speakerb82.###um, i haven't done much word processing work with my job.###i do some###speakera83.###uh-huh.###speakerb84.###and i,###and the d base work 0 i've done *t*-1 was strictly class related.###speakera85.###i've never used d base, um,###but i've heard both good things and bad things about it.###speakerb86.
95200:7	but certainly comparable.	certainly	###speakerb88.###it's got some pretty strong competitors.###some of them have reviews that *t*-1 are better than d base,###so, i, i think 0 by now, it's a matter of, uh, personal taste.###speakera89.###yeah,###people told me that it was sort of cumbersome 0 * to use *t*-1.###speakerb90.###i can understand that very easily.### i've used, i've had a class on, um, r base and also in paradox###speakera91.###uh-huh.###speakerb92.###and both of those seem very easy 0 * to use *t*-1 compared to d base.###speakera93.###uh-huh.###do you think 0 you d base is more flexible or allows you to do more.###or do you think 0 the others are pretty much compatible these days?###speakerb94.###um, i wouldn't say compatible,
95273:13	i mean maybe it's, uh,	maybe	###speakera6.###right.###speakerb7.###and i don't have a problem *ich*-1 at all with employers, uh, testing in the hiring process,###but i, i, i don't, i don't have a problem with them *ich*-1 too much, testing even after the fact,###but i do a little bit where it, where it wouldn't hurt anybody *t*-1.###i don't know,###sometimes i think 0 they carry it a little bit too far.###speakera8.###uh-huh###speakerb9.###but,###speakera10.###unless an employer has a reason *-1 to believe that his, uh, the work competency of, of the employ-, employee is, is hurting the business.###speakerb11.###yeah.###speakera12.###speakerb13.###right###speakera14.
95307:28	and that, i think, is even probably more widely *ich*-2 abused *-1 by, you know, the masses than, than drugs, so * to speak.	probably	###there's no way.### but, but my concern is, uh, school bus drivers.###speakerb21.###oh, yeah.###tr-,###the train drivers,###speakera22.###um, i'm not even,###i'm in education,###i'm not even opposed to it for that.###uh, i'm concerned in the medical field.###speakerb23.###yeah.###speakera24.### i, i, i think 0 they should screen for alcohol in these areas, too because i consider that a drug.###speakerb25.###i wish 0 they would *?*.###speakera26.###speakerb27.###i wish 0 they would *?*,
95406:40	and i guess 0 you'd report that to a supervisor, maybe anonymously or something because i, i would feel very uncomfortable *-1 working with someone 0 i knew 0 *t*-2 was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol,	maybe	###oh, absolutely,###speakera66.###speakerb67.###there are so many people with, with their petty axes 0 * to grind *t*-1###speakera68.###right.###speakerb69.###it could really get out of hand.###speakera70.###right.###speakerb71.###speakera72.###so, i, i, i would really rather know, however,###there's got *-1 to be some backup * to say that### if, if somebody does observe you at, say at a party, uh, using drugs i would think that it *exp*-1 would be their obligation * to report that.###speakerb73.###yeah.###speakera74.###speakerb75.###* to report it,
95534:10	and i probably re-, rebelled against it.	probably	###speakerb123.###speakera124.### and, and then they say, well, if you give them the right * to do this, then they're going *-1 to take some other right away from you,###but i, i firm-,###speakerb125.###i don't believe that.###speakera126.###i think that an employer has the right * to ask you *-1 to do anything,###and, of course, the big deal, one of the big deals now, too, is to, that when you, come into a company *t*-2, as you sign a paper saying that i will go *-1 take a,###speakera1.###okay, uh,###well do you, uh, keep a family budget###or do you have some,###speakerb2.###no,###i don't use a family budget,###my father who *t*-1 is very old has kept one his entire life,###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.
95537:8	i probably should have kept one.	probably	###but i, i firm-,###speakerb125.###i don't believe that.###speakera126.###i think that an employer has the right * to ask you *-1 to do anything,###and, of course, the big deal, one of the big deals now, too, is to, that when you, come into a company *t*-2, as you sign a paper saying that i will go *-1 take a,###speakera1.###okay, uh,###well do you, uh, keep a family budget###or do you have some,###speakerb2.###no,###i don't use a family budget,###my father who *t*-1 is very old has kept one his entire life,###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.###and i probably re-, rebelled against it.###speakera5.###speakerb6.
95559:13	and i will probably ke-, start *-1 keeping a little better, track of it.	probably	###speakera7.###oh, interesting.###speakerb8.###speakera9.###yes,###well, uh, we sort of started *-1 doing it years and years ago###and my husband started graduate school, when we were first married *-1 *t*-2,###and i sort of just got in the habit, i guess 0 *t*-1. and, you know, never have gotten out of it.###i can not really say that it's a formal budget,###it's more just a, a pretty, uh, a fairly, uh, accurate, uh, recording of what i spend *t*-1, and what i think 0 i am going *-2 to have *-3 to spend *t*-4.###speakerb10.###right.###speakera11.###and, uh,###speakerb12.###i think 0 it makes much more sense,###speakera13.###yeah.###speakerb14.###and i have recently, uh, gotten out of debt and everything
95577:29	so, i think 0 it *exp*-1 is probably better * to have some sort of a, a, at least a record	probably	###speakerb14.###and i have recently, uh, gotten out of debt and everything###and i will probably ke-, start *-1 keeping a little better, track of it.###speakera15.###yeah.###speakerb16.###speakera17.###yeah.###speakerb18.###i just, uh, spent whatever *t*-1 came in and, and, uh, didn-, never knew what *t*-2 came in and what *t*-3 went out. but, uh, just, you know, like, about like the government runs.###speakera19.###right.###speakerb20.###speakera21.###yeah.###speakerb22.###huh.###speakera23.###that sounds real similar.###speakerb24.
95635:105	i guess 0 it would have been, i will take that back, it must have been in the forties, because they had been married, uh, probably fifteen years at the time.	probably	###i could not believe 0 he did that,### but then, so, i took the ones from fifty-two on to the present,###speakera39.###oh dear.###speakerb40.###speakera41.###yes.###speakerb42.###but, * to look, to have looked back into the twenties, thirties and forties, it *exp*-1 would have been fantastic, * to see that.###speakera43.###oh yes.###speakerb44.###but, uh,###speakera45.###well, as a matter of fact, uh, my mother was going through some things *ich*-2 not lon-, not long ago, i guess 0 it has been a couple of years ago, in an old trunk that she had *t*-1.###and she came upon a, a budget book that she had *t*-1 back in the thirties. uh, when they,###speakerb46.###uh-huh.###speakera47.###it was the late, well
95729:25	and, i think 0 that is probably what *t*-1 happened in our house	probably	###speakera79.###yes.###speakerb80.###speakera81.###right,###yes.###speakerb82.###the other one may be very careful,###speakera83.###yes.###speakerb84.###and she may marry somebody###and, of course, it would be good because, it you marry somebody a little loose, then she will have that stability of *-1 watching, uh.###speakera85.###yeah.###speakerb86.###you should have one in the, in the, in the house.###speakera87.###i think 0 that is true,###i, uh,
95748:39	if it had not been for my wife, i would have probably been in debtor's prison, if we had one.	probably	###i, uh,###and, i think 0 that is probably what *t*-1 happened in our house###speakerb88.###and i think,###speakera89.###because i think 0 my husband was not quite as, uh, good at *-1 saving and so on before we got married *-2###and i was, i was really diligent about that.###i was putting money aside and when, before i was married *-1, you know, when i was working out of college *t*-2###and, uh, that really paid off.###speakerb90.###yeah.###speakera91.###because when time *ich*-1 came *t*-2 for him to go back to graduate school, we were in, in fairly good shape financially as far as *-3 not having any major debts.###and,###speakerb92.###yeah,###that's about the way 0 it is *t*-1 here,###speakera93.###yeah.###speakerb94.
95934:30	as far as, maybe, maybe as the summer heat comes along i would sort of like *-1 going somewhere where it's not so hot *t*-2. and being able *-3 to be outside, enjoy outsor-, outside activities,	maybe	###well wonderful,###i will look you up in the fall then.###speakera165.###fantastic.###speakerb166.###okay.###speakera167.###well, it *exp*-1's been good * ta-, it's been a good type conversation.###speakerb168.###bye-bye.###speakera169.###bye-bye.###speakera1.###well, this is the season for vacations.###and, uh, i guess 0 for places 0 i like *-1 to go *t*-2, i enjoy *-3 going to the beach and having, having outdoor, being outdoors somewhere.###someplace that *t*-1's very different than texas.###speakerb2.###right.###speakera3.###and i,
95934:38	as far as, maybe, maybe as the summer heat comes along i would sort of like *-1 going somewhere where it's not so hot *t*-2. and being able *-3 to be outside, enjoy outsor-, outside activities,	maybe	###well wonderful,###i will look you up in the fall then.###speakera165.###fantastic.###speakerb166.###okay.###speakera167.###well, it *exp*-1's been good * ta-, it's been a good type conversation.###speakerb168.###bye-bye.###speakera169.###bye-bye.###speakera1.###well, this is the season for vacations.###and, uh, i guess 0 for places 0 i like *-1 to go *t*-2, i enjoy *-3 going to the beach and having, having outdoor, being outdoors somewhere.###someplace that *t*-1's very different than texas.###speakerb2.###right.###speakera3.###and i,
96108:48	it will take, uh, a day and a half * to get there, probably.	probably	###great.###speakerb52.###speakera53.###oh.###speakerb54.###but, uh, it's a pretty nice place,###you will need *-1 to try *-2 to go and, stay there sometime.###speakera55.###well, we have just we have just,###speakerb56.###speakera57.###speakerb58.###it's a little far from here,###but, uh,###speakera59.###are you driving?###speakerb60.###yeah,###we are *?*.###we are *?*,
96152:30	so, anyway, so maybe, maybe within a year, we will see how that falls *t*-1.	maybe	###uh-huh.###speakera71.### and, uh, in, and in the summer * would be more like a two month, two month break.###speakerb72.###right.###speakera73.### so, and they hope *-1 to boost the, they hope *-2 to boost the learning of the children. just the retention of the material for them.###speakerb74.###i see.###speakera75.###so, uh,###speakerb76.###* kind of scattering the vacation out, throughout the year.###speakera77.###yeah,###speakerb78.###yeah.###speakera79.###yeah.###so, it's

96156:47	we will head for, we will head for florida, maybe in somewhat of an off season, instead of summer.	maybe	###right.###speakera73.### so, and they hope *-1 to boost the, they hope *-2 to boost the learning of the children. just the retention of the material for them.###speakerb74.###i see.###speakera75.###so, uh,###speakerb76.###* kind of scattering the vacation out, throughout the year.###speakera77.###yeah,###speakerb78.###yeah.###speakera79.###yeah.###so, it's### so, anyway, so maybe, maybe within a year, we will see how that falls *t*-1.###speakerb80.###right.###speakera81.
96164:16	well, that's probably ne-, all 0 we need *-1 to do *t*-2 today.	probably	###* kind of scattering the vacation out, throughout the year.###speakera77.###yeah,###speakerb78.###yeah.###speakera79.###yeah.###so, it's### so, anyway, so maybe, maybe within a year, we will see how that falls *t*-1.###speakerb80.###right.###speakera81.### we will head for, we will head for florida, maybe in somewhat of an off season, instead of summer.###speakerb82.###right.###speakera83.###so, uh.###speakerb84.###okay.###speakera85.
96306:10	oh, definitely,	definitely	###uh-huh.###speakera49.###but, uh, even so, there were very, very few women in technical writing.###speakerb50.###yeah.###speakera51.###but, that has changed a lot.###speakerb52.###oh, yeah.###speakera53.###in recent years it has just really, really changed a lot.###speakerb54.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera55.### and, and i think that, uh, you know, the one thing that i have seen *t*-1 is that more and more women are getting into management,###speakerb56.###speakera57.###but i think 0 they have got a long way 0 *-2 to go *t*-3.###speakerb58.
96307:4	definitely.	definitely	###speakera49.###but, uh, even so, there were very, very few women in technical writing.###speakerb50.###yeah.###speakera51.###but, that has changed a lot.###speakerb52.###oh, yeah.###speakera53.###in recent years it has just really, really changed a lot.###speakerb54.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera55.### and, and i think that, uh, you know, the one thing that i have seen *t*-1 is that more and more women are getting into management,###speakerb56.###speakera57.###but i think 0 they have got a long way 0 *-2 to go *t*-3.###speakerb58.###oh, definitely,
96383:12	so, she definitely entering into, uh, a male profession.	definitely	###speakerb88.###do you?###speakera89.###yes.###in fact, i have a daughter who *t*-1 is in a, a, who *t*-2 just graduated in civil engineering, from college.###speakerb90.###oh, wonderful.###speakera91.###so, she is pretty much, although there were some other women in her class, she was, you know, uh, one of the minorities,###uh, females in the class.###speakerb92.###uh-huh.###speakera93.###speakerb94.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera95.###speakerb96.###uh-huh.###speakera97.
96419:68	but, uh, that is one area where it, that i can see 0 *t*-1 might change, but i really doubt 0 *t*-1 will change.	might	###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera107.###but, uh, i do not know,### i, you see it in, uh, also in, uh, like in church, uh, where more and more women are becoming ministers. in, uh, you know, in protestant congregations *t*-1###speakerb108.###oh, yeah.###speakera109.###and, uh, it *exp*-1 will be interesting * to see if, if roman catholicism ever, uh, recognizes women in, in the role of priest.###speakerb110.###speakera111.### i do-, i do not know if you are roman catholic or, you know, what *ich*-2 you know *t*-1 about that.###speakerb112.###no,###huh-uh.###speakera113.###speakerb114.###uh-huh.###speakera115.###i am not *?* either,
96428:5	probably not.	probably	###speakerb110.###speakera111.### i do-, i do not know if you are roman catholic or, you know, what *ich*-2 you know *t*-1 about that.###speakerb112.###no,###huh-uh.###speakera113.###speakerb114.###uh-huh.###speakera115.###i am not *?* either,###but, uh, that is one area where it, that i can see 0 *t*-1 might change, but i really doubt 0 *t*-1 will change.###speakerb116.###yeah,###yeah.###speakera117.###speakerb118.###not for a long time anyway.###speakera119.###no,
96573:10	but i probably talked to seven or eight people.	probably	###speakera173.###or,###speakerb174.###well, i am not a home, at home a lot.###speakera175.###yeah.###speakerb176.###i am at work right now.###speakera177.###oh, yeah.###speakerb178.###i put my work number,###but, at home, uh, the recorder gets my calls.###speakera179.###oh, yeah.###speakerb180.###usually, i am not there,###speakera181.###right,###speakerb182.
96660:11	we are certainly not *?*,	certainly	###speakerb214.###well, thanks for * calling.###speakera215.###* thank you.###speakerb216.###uh-huh.###speakera217.###bye-bye.###speakerb218.###bye-bye.###speakera1.###hi pat.###speakerb2.###hi.###one of the interesting things that i have considered *t*-1 about the role change for women is that women of my age, my generation, were trained and taught and brought up *-2 to be the * leave it to beaver housewives.###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.###but we are not living in that world.###speakera5.
97180:29	uh, and, and i might,	might	###speakera17.###* excuse me one second.###speakerb18.###speakera19.###huh-uh.###no,###not at all,###in fact my situation is a little bit strange,###i was, uh, a student for many years, and then graduated and went and worked in france for awhile.###and, i, have just come back and was doing consulting work.###speakerb20.###oh.###speakera21.###speakerb22.###oh, my.###speakera23.###so i am just taking a little bit of time off right now.###speakerb24.###a sabbatical.###speakera25.
97196:17	but, uh, i might start *-1 to go crazy with it too.	might	###so i am just taking a little bit of time off right now.###speakerb24.###a sabbatical.###speakera25.###uh, and, and i might,###speakerb26.###well i hope 0 you can stay as long as possible with it.###speakera27.###yeah,###well hopefully i can do some consulting work at home.###and, if i can do that it will,###yeah,###speakerb28.###oh yeah,###that would be wonderful.###right.###speakera29.###i'll be able *-1 to spend the time with my daughter, and not have *-2 to worry too much about child care.###speakerb30.###speakera31.
97234:55	maybe if i needed *-1 to work part time, like four hours a day, i might do that, cause like, you should get enough stimulation from you the rest of the time.	might	###and you just miss the little things,###speakera39.###yeah.###speakerb40.### and, and, uh,###speakera41.###well, i think 0 for me, mumblex the important concerns, i do not think 0 i would put her in day care for joint, situation right now, unless it was like one other child with a, with a person.###speakerb42.###uh-huh.###speakera43.###speakerb44.###uh-huh.###speakera45.###i would not want her to be into a, in a large day care situation *-2 so young. because i think 0 a little infant just does not get the stimulation 0 they need *t*-1.###speakerb46.###uh-huh.###speakera47.###speakerb48.###that's right.###speakera49.
97243:54	and if not, the infant is going *-1 to lay in the crib all day, and maybe have a mobile *ich*-2 above it 0 * to play with *t*-3.	maybe	###speakera43.###speakerb44.###uh-huh.###speakera45.###i would not want her to be into a, in a large day care situation *-2 so young. because i think 0 a little infant just does not get the stimulation 0 they need *t*-1.###speakerb46.###uh-huh.###speakera47.###speakerb48.###that's right.###speakera49.###maybe if i needed *-1 to work part time, like four hours a day, i might do that, cause like, you should get enough stimulation from you the rest of the time.###but, uh, i just think that, you know, when there's two year olds running around *t*-1, the, whoever *t*-2 is taking care of, the care givers are going *-3 to pay attention to the two year olds.###speakerb50.###that's right.###speakera51.###and only when the infant screams *t*-1, are they going *-2 to go there,###speakerb52.###that's right.###speakera53.
97310:13	and i will probably be going back to work around january, whereas she will be about, eight or nine months old.	probably	###how old is she *t*-1?###speakera73.###she's two months *ich*-1 now, nine weeks.###speakerb74.###oh, yeah.###speakera75.###and she's just drastically moving her eyes from one side to another and things like that.###speakerb76.###uh-huh.###speakera77.###and she's just started that like yesterday or the day before,###speakerb78.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera79.### and so every days are different.###speakerb80.###uh-huh.###speakera81.###and i think that, you know, i think 0 child care for infants is much harder than when they are older *t*-1,
97324:10	so you might have a real problem with that.	might	###speakera79.### and so every days are different.###speakerb80.###uh-huh.###speakera81.###and i think that, you know, i think 0 child care for infants is much harder than when they are older *t*-1,###and i will probably be going back to work around january, whereas she will be about, eight or nine months old.###speakerb82.###um.###speakera83.###speakerb84.###a little older.###speakera85.###and so i think, you know, 0 she will be at a,###i have heard 0 it's a rough age 0 * to put them into a,###speakerb86.###it is *?* because that's when they are clinging to mama *t*-1,###speakera87.###yeah.###speakerb88.
97360:85	it would, if they were where i could not get my hands on them *t*-1, i am afraid 0 i would probably go crazy.	probably	###speakerb96.###is it your parents or your husband's parents?###speakera97.###my parents,###my husband's parents are in france.###so, it's a little bit harder###but during, you know,### sh-, sh-, she's met them already.###speakerb98.###oh.###speakera99.###not that she will remember them,###but she's met them.###speakerb100.###right,###right.###that's nice when, uh,### i, my, i have three grandchildren,###another one coming in september,###and i,
97376:28	well, if i work part time that might be doable.	might	###that's nice when, uh,### i, my, i have three grandchildren,###another one coming in september,###and i,### it would, if they were where i could not get my hands on them *t*-1, i am afraid 0 i would probably go crazy.###speakera101.###uh-huh.###speakerb102.###you know, i, i like that,###speakera103.###are they all nearby?###speakerb104.###but if, it you do not have *-1 to put them in child care, that's, that's an ideal situation for you, is * to stay with them as,###or you can set up your work program and your husband's so that one of you is there all the time.###speakera105.###yeah.###speakerb106.### that's, that's wonderful for the child.###but,###speakera107.
97407:22	and, you know, * maybe do some free lance type work at home.	maybe	###right now the situation is so tight at many places, that it *exp*-1's even hard * to have a choice.###speakerb112.###uh.###speakera113.###speakerb114.###uh.###speakera115.###incredible,###but you know, since this is,###people before they get pregnant are finding child care for the kids.###speakerb116.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera117.###and, you know, i just find that incredible.###and my sister-in-law is going *-1 to have a baby very, very soon###and she is intending *-1 to stay home with the baby.###speakerb118.###oh.###speakera119.
97426:20	and so, uh, she might be able *-1 to do it a couple of hours a day	might	###speakera119.###and, you know, * maybe do some free lance type work at home.###and so, if i go back to work on a part time basis, i am hoping 0 i can leave my daughter with her. because, her daughter again will be a couple of months, my daughter will be about six months older than hers *?*.###speakerb120.###oh, that would be wonderful.###speakera121.###and,###speakerb122.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera123.###it will be a little rough when she is a very, very little infant *t*-1,###speakerb124.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera125.###but like when she is a month or so *t*-1, my sister-in-law has had lots and lots of experience dealing with baby-sitting for large families.###speakerb126.###oh.###speakera127.
97427:22	and we cou-, might even be able *-1 to do it on a trade off basis. that i watch, their baby when they want *-2 to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever *t*-4, or if she wants an afternoon off. even if she wants an afternoon 0 * just to work. uh, and not be bothered *t*-5,	might	###and, you know, * maybe do some free lance type work at home.###and so, if i go back to work on a part time basis, i am hoping 0 i can leave my daughter with her. because, her daughter again will be a couple of months, my daughter will be about six months older than hers *?*.###speakerb120.###oh, that would be wonderful.###speakera121.###and,###speakerb122.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera123.###it will be a little rough when she is a very, very little infant *t*-1,###speakerb124.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera125.###but like when she is a month or so *t*-1, my sister-in-law has had lots and lots of experience dealing with baby-sitting for large families.###speakerb126.###oh.###speakera127.###and so, uh, she might be able *-1 to do it a couple of hours a day
97441:8	we might be able *-1 to exchange that way.	might	###speakera125.###but like when she is a month or so *t*-1, my sister-in-law has had lots and lots of experience dealing with baby-sitting for large families.###speakerb126.###oh.###speakera127.###and so, uh, she might be able *-1 to do it a couple of hours a day###and we cou-, might even be able *-1 to do it on a trade off basis. that i watch, their baby when they want *-2 to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever *t*-4, or if she wants an afternoon off. even if she wants an afternoon 0 * just to work. uh, and not be bothered *t*-5,###speakerb128.###right.###speakera129.###speakerb130.###right.###speakera131.###speakerb132.###right.###speakera133.###speakerb134.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera135.
97473:13	and it's probably my fault, because i do not have a real schedule now.	probably	###really well trained people.###speakera141.###speakerb142.###right,###speakera143.###yeah.###speakerb144.###and * have, have some kind of real good program, set *-1 up so that you, when you go *t*-2 you can be assured that if there's an emergency that person in charge knows c p r or first aid###speakera145.###yeah.###speakerb146.### or, and * have some kind of program set *-1 up, like you say, * to stimulate the kids, or educate them in some manner. and have the, you know, the right toys and the right setting and, uh, have, a, an organized type of program set *-2 up so that the kids have a schedule, you know,###speakera147.###oh, yeah.###speakerb148.###that's real important to little kids.###speakera149.###yeah,###well she's,###my daughter does not seem *-1 to be on a real schedule yet,
97743:16	i think 0 probably is as enlightened as anyone can be *?* at this particular stage in their life time.	probably	###speakerb102.###uh-huh.###speakera103.###speakerb104.###men have a lot of trouble with that though.###speakera105.###uh-huh.###speakerb106.###they, in their, in their own peer relationships, they do not treat themselves equal,###and so it *exp*-1's really difficult for them * to treat women as equals.### they are, they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower.###uh, it just seems that, it seems, it seems that they are more comfortable that way.###and i do not know if that's, i mean, that's, it's a militaristic point of view i guess 0 *t*-1, you know,###somebody can not be colonel###and everybody else is infantry,###but it's just really interesting to me.###i am married *-1 to a wonderful man, you know, who *t*-2 treats me very, you know, with a, with as,###speakera107.###uh. uh-huh,###speakerb108.
97881:29	i, i'm guessing probably an hour and forty-five minutes, maybe.	probably	###speakerb16.###but, i mean, time wise, how long,###was it two hour###speakera17.###oh.###speakerb18.###or,###speakera19.###uh, it's, i think 0 it's less than two hours.###speakerb20.###uh-huh.###okay,###okay.###speakera21.### we, we rented one *ich*-3 recently that *t*-2 seemed *-1 to go on forever.###speakerb22.###that always seems *-1 to happen when you rent them *t*-2, you know.###speakera23.###yeah,###but this one, it was fairly long.
97881:47	i, i'm guessing probably an hour and forty-five minutes, maybe.	maybe	###speakerb16.###but, i mean, time wise, how long,###was it two hour###speakera17.###oh.###speakerb18.###or,###speakera19.###uh, it's, i think 0 it's less than two hours.###speakerb20.###uh-huh.###okay,###okay.###speakera21.### we, we rented one *ich*-3 recently that *t*-2 seemed *-1 to go on forever.###speakerb22.###that always seems *-1 to happen when you rent them *t*-2, you know.###speakera23.###yeah,###but this one, it was fairly long.
98150:16	well, i've certainly enjoyed *-1 talking with you.	certainly	###oh, god.###speakera117.### i, i have a theory.###i like movies for entertainment.###i don't want *-1 to uh, go away *-2 depressed from *-3 watching a movie.###speakerb118.###right.###speakera119.###speakerb120.###right,###right.###speakera121.###speakerb122.###i agree,###i agree.###speakera123.###life's depressing enough.###speakerb124.###that's for sure.###speakera125.
98178:11	there are certainly parts of town 0 i would not want *-1 to live in *t*-2.	certainly	###and, uh###speakera129.###* have a nice weekend.###speakerb130.###i hope 0 you see a good movie soon.###speakera131.###okay.###speakerb132.###okay.###speakera133.###bye.###speakerb134.###bye-bye.###speakerb1.###well, hal, what's, uh, what's crime like *t*-1 in dallas?###speakera2.###well, it depends where in dallas you are *t*-1.###speakerb3.###uh-huh.###speakera4.
98236:42	uh, well, if we have one murder a year that's probably as many,	probably	###no one's, you know,### or, or fathers are just missing, you know,###so there's no, uh, no consistency there in the home or whatever.###there's no one *-1 to tell them what *t*-2's right and what *t*-3's wrong, you know.###speakera18.###yeah.### the sort of on my end is *t*-1 more of the upper middle class###so i think 0 our, uh,###speakerb19.###uh-huh.###speakera20.###not that we don't have a certain amount of local problems###speakerb21.###uh-huh###speakera22.###but on the other hand, uh, we get the, uh, affect of the, uh, the city###and, uh, the main crimes within the suburb here are the, the theft crimes. a small number of assaults,###speakerb23.###uh-huh.###speakera24.
98256:18	i think 0 they definitely have more problems that, uh, in, in the area.	definitely	###uh, well, if we have one murder a year that's probably as many,###speakerb25.###yeah.###speakera26.###but then, you know, you go into dallas###and they are, unfortunately uh, having murders at a rate greater than one a day.###speakerb27.###uh-huh.###speakera28.###speakerb29.###yeah.###speakera30.###speakerb31.###yeah,###i think 0 that's, we're about the same in baltimore.###though, uh, washington, i think is, uh, close by###and, you know, they experience a lot more.###speakera32.###uh-huh.###speakerb33.
98303:37	i think 0 they, the drug culture definitely has, uh, is one of the main problems.	definitely	###speakera46.###speakerb47.###yeah,###i think, uh-huh.###speakera48.###speakerb49.###speakera50.###speakerb51.###yeah,### i, i, i think, 0 i agree with you there.###speakera52.###because it just was not, uh, something back in the sixties that uh, i even had *-1 to worry about *t*-2.###speakerb53.###uh-huh.###speakera54.###but i think, you know, that there is a lot in the society where things have changed *t*-1,###uh, so it's effected all of us.###speakerb55.###uh-huh.###yeah,
98326:11	it would certainly be an interesting test	certainly	###speakera56.###uh-huh.###speakerb57.###speakera58.###uh-huh.###speakerb59.###that make sense?###he's one of the big proponents of that.###he gets on national television and, and says that, you know.###so it's, uh,###and he was a d-, d-, a district attorney before, and a prosecutor before *-2 becoming, becoming mayor.###so that's a really stran-,###you know, it's a different viewpoint.###i, uh,###speakera60.###you know, in a sense i don't, i'm n-, i have real mixed feelings on that###speakerb61.###yeah.###speakera62.###because it comes a bit from the angle that the, uh, uh,
98345:16	i mean they probably became weakened physically *ich*-1 and other things to the point that their life expectancy was real short *t*-2,	probably	###because it comes a bit from the angle that the, uh, uh,###it would certainly be an interesting test###speakerb63.###uh-huh.###speakera64.###but the other side of it, to me,###speakerb65.###what *t*-1 happens if we lose worse.###speakera66.###uh, y-,###well, the other side is that unfortunately some of the down side,###and i think 0 if i look back fifty or a hundred years i'd say 0, you know, back then there were the opium dens###speakerb67.###right.###speakera68.###but the thing is, 0 if somebody ruined their life, uh, society didn't try *-1 to then save themselves from it,###they let this person who *t*-1 had ruined it uh, become, well, die or whatever.###speakerb69.###uh-huh.###speakera70.
98361:31	i, uh, i would certainly like *-1 to see a real test of, of * making drugs real cheap * to see if when you make them available *t*-2 people then don't use them.	certainly	###they let this person who *t*-1 had ruined it uh, become, well, die or whatever.###speakerb69.###uh-huh.###speakera70.###i mean they probably became weakened physically *ich*-1 and other things to the point that their life expectancy was real short *t*-2,###speakerb71.###right,###yeah.###speakera72.###but now we tend *-1 to believe 0 somewhere in the health care system otherwise, we need *-2 to take care of people even if they have, you know, physically ruined themselves.###speakerb73.###yeah,###they have induced it themselves.###speakera74.###yeah###speakerb75.###yeah,###that's true.###speakera76.###and so, to me that's,
98518:47	uh, but then when you quantify things *t*-3 and that might also hold criminal trials for how many years *t*-1 is appropriate, uh, that they might leave it to somebody else who, uh, *t*-2 has expertise in that.	might	### that, those are some important points.###yeah,###i,### that's, those are,###speakera132.### what are, what does your city have *t*-1 for gun control if anything?###speakerb133.###well, see maryland is one of the most,###we just voted in, uh, gun control, strong gun control here in the state of maryland.### i, i think,###speakerb1.###okay.###speakera2.###okay.###well, i, uh, i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers, i'm not a lawyer, uh, that *t*-1 i find 0 a lot of things are so specialized that i'm not sure,###and i, i look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense of, of the value of, and worth, so that they have real problems when it comes to, uh, uh *t*-1,###they can find guilt or innocence###speakerb3.###right.###speakera4.
98518:97	uh, but then when you quantify things *t*-3 and that might also hold criminal trials for how many years *t*-1 is appropriate, uh, that they might leave it to somebody else who, uh, *t*-2 has expertise in that.	might	### that, those are some important points.###yeah,###i,### that's, those are,###speakera132.### what are, what does your city have *t*-1 for gun control if anything?###speakerb133.###well, see maryland is one of the most,###we just voted in, uh, gun control, strong gun control here in the state of maryland.### i, i think,###speakerb1.###okay.###speakera2.###okay.###well, i, uh, i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers, i'm not a lawyer, uh, that *t*-1 i find 0 a lot of things are so specialized that i'm not sure,###and i, i look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense of, of the value of, and worth, so that they have real problems when it comes to, uh, uh *t*-1,###they can find guilt or innocence###speakerb3.###right.###speakera4.
98540:37	and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three.	might	###right,###i agree, too.###i don't think 0 the jury should be the ones that, that *t*-1 put the sense-, sentencings down.###i think 0 the judges should *?*,###or even a panel of, of lawyers if, if it got to that point. might be better at than just regular civil people. not knowing, you know, exactly what things are *t*-1, from, from murder on up to like tax stuff, you know.###speakera6.###uh-huh.###speakerb7.###speakera8.###yeah.###because i find that, uh,###i've been on a few juries###and, uh, as a say, i, i tend *-1 to be around, uh, civil cases because i've been an expert witness some,###and, uh, many matters are so complicated that it *exp*-1's so hard * to, uh, come up with the fair value, uh, or the fair sentence###and one thing that you get *t*-2 if you have some expertise is, uh, you know the range of, of possible values or terms or, you know, how heinous was the crime *t*-1.###speakerb9.###right.###speakera10.###uh, that, uh,###when i only do something one, two or three times *t*-1 i'm hardly an expert on it,
98559:22	i mean, it *exp*-4 might be more important for them * to put a sen-, sen-, sentencing *ich*-5 *ich*-2 down that *t*-1 was, uh, longer, you know, that didn't fit, the punishment didn't fit the crime *t*-3.	might	###when i only do something one, two or three times *t*-1 i'm hardly an expert on it,###and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three.###speakerb11.###yeah###and,###speakera12.###and so how do you relate as to whether this particular armed robbery was a, you know, worth five years or twenty-five *t*-1.###speakerb13.###right,###that's,###yeah.### and, and most people that *t*-1 do sit on juries,###some people just sit on them once in their lifetime, you know, if they're that lucky sometimes. or, you know, what, whatever the case may be *t*-1. and, and may not have any idea of what, what the standard punishment *ich*-2 would be *t*-3 for it.###speakera14.###uh-huh.###speakerb15.###speakera16.###yeah.###speakerb17.###and it, they may have some different idea,
98568:147	the only thing 0 i worry about *t*-1 sometimes is if, if you get somebody *ich*-5 *ich*-6 in there that, that *t*-2 has a name, that *t*-3 is the defendant and, you know, sometimes, might have more pull, which *t*-4 that does happen.	might	###that's,###yeah.### and, and most people that *t*-1 do sit on juries,###some people just sit on them once in their lifetime, you know, if they're that lucky sometimes. or, you know, what, whatever the case may be *t*-1. and, and may not have any idea of what, what the standard punishment *ich*-2 would be *t*-3 for it.###speakera14.###uh-huh.###speakerb15.###speakera16.###yeah.###speakerb17.###and it, they may have some different idea,###i mean, it *exp*-4 might be more important for them * to put a sen-, sen-, sentencing *ich*-5 *ich*-2 down that *t*-1 was, uh, longer, you know, that didn't fit, the punishment didn't fit the crime *t*-3.###or not long enough or, you know, whatever the case may be *t*-2.###speakera18.###uh-huh.###speakerb19.###speakera20.###yeah.###speakerb21.### i, i think 0 the judges do have that, that better knowledge of it.
98633:17	uh, such like, maybe in murder they get *-1 to choose whether it's, uh, premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees.	maybe	### and, and you shouldn't be able *-1 to go on the lesser charge.### i don't, i don't think 0 that's right because all's 0 that's going *-1 to do *t*-2 is * say, oh, well, you know, that was a breeze,###i can go out and do it again and, you know have the same thing happen.###speakera38.###yeah.###speakerb39.### that's, that's not right.###speakera40.###well, that's where, uh, the role of juries is, is restricted *-1 *t*-2###and, i'm not sure 0 i'd want *-1 to change that aspect of it,###one is, 0 it's restricted *-1 in the sense that, juries only decide the charges that *t*-2 are actually, uh, brought *-3, you know###speakerb41.###right.###speakera42.###if it's first degree rape, second deg-, degree rape or whatever, they only get *-1 to decide on that,###well, okay this person has been charged *-1 with first degree rape, uh,###and you can decide guilt or innocence on that.###speakerb43.###uh-huh.###speakera44.
98710:32	so i'll be, i'll probably be wearing slacks as often as i do because i'm, i'm, if i'm going *-1 to be down on the floor *-2 messing with them, i'm not going *-3 to wear nylons and, you know nice nylons and dresses.	probably	###speakera7.###right.###well, i was just trying *-1 to make an introduction, here.###speakerb8.###oh, okay.###speakera9.### but, oh, and, and i haven't told you 0 i'm going *-1 to be at a different school this year, now.###speakerb10.###oh.###speakera11.###i've just gotten a, another job at an elementary library at barron.###speakerb12.###well, i bet 0 you're, you're, you may dress differently, then, for that.###speakera13.###right.###i,###well, not really.### i've got the, every day i've got *-1 to, uh, read to kindergartners,###so i'm going *-1 to be down on the floor with them.###i've got about forty kindergartners 0 i'm going *-1 to be doing, working with *t*-2 every day for, uh, you know, a half hour.
98712:71	well, what i wear *t*-1 sometimes depends on, on how cold i think 0 the school might be *t*-2 or what room i might be in *t*-3 since i'm a sub, and have different rooms 0 * to go to *t*-4. and always carry a sweater.	might	###well, i was just trying *-1 to make an introduction, here.###speakerb8.###oh, okay.###speakera9.### but, oh, and, and i haven't told you 0 i'm going *-1 to be at a different school this year, now.###speakerb10.###oh.###speakera11.###i've just gotten a, another job at an elementary library at barron.###speakerb12.###well, i bet 0 you're, you're, you may dress differently, then, for that.###speakera13.###right.###i,###well, not really.### i've got the, every day i've got *-1 to, uh, read to kindergartners,###so i'm going *-1 to be down on the floor with them.###i've got about forty kindergartners 0 i'm going *-1 to be doing, working with *t*-2 every day for, uh, you know, a half hour.###so i'll be, i'll probably be wearing slacks as often as i do because i'm, i'm, if i'm going *-1 to be down on the floor *-2 messing with them, i'm not going *-3 to wear nylons and, you know nice nylons and dresses.###speakerb14.

98745:65	and, and in the winter, you know, i just add a, maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than i do in the summer. and add a heavier jacket or, you know, wear jackets more *ich*-1 in the winter than i do in the summer.	maybe	###no,###you try *-1 to layer, so you can add or, or or take off.###speakera23.###* subtract.###speakerb24.###speakera25.###right.###speakerb26.###and it's, it *exp*-1's interesting * to notice when you go to different schools *t*-2 that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual, uh,###speakera27.### i, i think 0 some of the dress codes are different at different schools.###that's one of things, one of the things 0 i ask about *t*-1, you know, whether, whether she would allow slacks###and she said 0 she doesn't have a problem with that,###she just didn't like sloppy dressing.###speakerb28.###uh-huh.###speakera29.### and, and i said, well, you know, that was okay.###and i'm,###basically, i just, you know, i wear slacks year round except every, about once a week i try *-1 to wear a skirt.
98762:10	and one might be a hat day where you have *-1 to come up with some sort of hat *t*-2.	might	### and, and i said, well, you know, that was okay.###and i'm,###basically, i just, you know, i wear slacks year round except every, about once a week i try *-1 to wear a skirt.### and, and in the winter, you know, i just add a, maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than i do in the summer. and add a heavier jacket or, you know, wear jackets more *ich*-1 in the winter than i do in the summer.###speakerb30.###uh-huh.###speakera31.###that's about,### i don't, i don't really work in a profession that *t*-1 requires that i wear a business suit and, you know, look really,###speakerb32.###right,###and, well, for me sometimes, they even have * dress up days###or they, you know, have, have spirit week that, that you wear your different outfits *t*-1###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###and you have *-1 to have the color for that particular school if you, if you choose *-2 to participate in spirit week.###speakera35.###right.###speakerb36.
98769:57	but because i sort of stick to several schools, uh, i'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and, and might, might remember *-1 to do it.	might	###that's about,### i don't, i don't really work in a profession that *t*-1 requires that i wear a business suit and, you know, look really,###speakerb32.###right,###and, well, for me sometimes, they even have * dress up days###or they, you know, have, have spirit week that, that you wear your different outfits *t*-1###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###and you have *-1 to have the color for that particular school if you, if you choose *-2 to participate in spirit week.###speakera35.###right.###speakerb36.###and one might be a hat day where you have *-1 to come up with some sort of hat *t*-2.###speakera37.###and you never know that, though sometimes when you're going in *t*-1, do you?###speakerb38.###speakera39.###speakerb40.###no,

98774:53	and then many schools on a particular day during, uh, i guess football season, maybe all year long, they wear the school colors for, uh, game day which,	maybe	###or they, you know, have, have spirit week that, that you wear your different outfits *t*-1###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###and you have *-1 to have the color for that particular school if you, if you choose *-2 to participate in spirit week.###speakera35.###right.###speakerb36.###and one might be a hat day where you have *-1 to come up with some sort of hat *t*-2.###speakera37.###and you never know that, though sometimes when you're going in *t*-1, do you?###speakerb38.###speakera39.###speakerb40.###no,###but because i sort of stick to several schools, uh, i'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and, and might, might remember *-1 to do it.###speakera41.###right,###right.###speakerb42.

98813:29	i think 0 the elementary school teachers, or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than, than some of the high school teachers, i think.	maybe	###speakera49.###that,###so that's,###and i don't know, you know,### i, i think about, well, the dress code 0 they have *t*-1 for the kids, you know.###are###they put one on the parents, or the teachers and say 0 they have *-2 to, the men have *-1 to wear ties###and there can be no blue jeans worn *###and,###because some of the teachers 0 i know *t*-1 wear, uh, dress up jeans, not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had *t*-2 dry cleaned *-3 so they have got the crease###speakerb50.###uh-huh.###speakera51.###and, uh, you know, they'll wear it with a nice top.### and, and, uh, i don't know that that looks that bad.###but, if you're going *-1 to tell the kids 0 they c-, have *-2 to dress up, i guess 0 you can tell the teachers that, too.###speakerb52.###yeah,### it, it,###i see that the,
98832:52	and they'll just wear your common, ordinary, you know, whatever you might might say *t*-2,	might	###i see that the,###i think 0 the elementary school teachers, or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than, than some of the high school teachers, i think.###speakera53.###uh-huh.###speakerb54.###but it, i think 0 it varies, it, it just so much.### anything, anything can go.###speakera55.###uh-huh.###speakerb56.###and you can see 0 in some of the departments in some of the schools, like history at clark, they're all pretty fancy.###but they're just sort of into clothes,###and then there's other departments that *t*-1 aren't *?*.###speakera57.###right.###speakerb58.###speakera59.###right,###right.###speakerb60.
98832:58	and they'll just wear your common, ordinary, you know, whatever you might might say *t*-2,	might	###i see that the,###i think 0 the elementary school teachers, or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than, than some of the high school teachers, i think.###speakera53.###uh-huh.###speakerb54.###but it, i think 0 it varies, it, it just so much.### anything, anything can go.###speakera55.###uh-huh.###speakerb56.###and you can see 0 in some of the departments in some of the schools, like history at clark, they're all pretty fancy.###but they're just sort of into clothes,###and then there's other departments that *t*-1 aren't *?*.###speakera57.###right.###speakerb58.###speakera59.###right,###right.###speakerb60.
98843:23	and so you try *-1 to maybe follow those if you know 0 you're going there,	maybe	###but they're just sort of into clothes,###and then there's other departments that *t*-1 aren't *?*.###speakera57.###right.###speakerb58.###speakera59.###right,###right.###speakerb60.###and they'll just wear your common, ordinary, you know, whatever you might might say *t*-2,###speakera61.###yeah,###there's a couple teachers up there that, that *t*-1 do dress up more than others.###speakerb62.###speakera63.###speakerb64.###right.###speakera65.###right.###speakerb66.
98860:24	some of those male coaches, that might really,	might	###speakera65.###right.###speakerb66.###and so you try *-1 to maybe follow those if you know 0 you're going there,###you don't want *-1 to dress too tacky because you're going *-2 to be in the same room with them.###speakera67.###right.###well, and you always,###course, it's a standing joke, you know, when the, when the men come in in a, a tie and a suit coat *t*-1, you say, you know, what, have you got a job interview today###or, there, there's, there's usually, yeah, there's usually something going on that, that, uh, and *t*-1 would, would, uh, cause that to happen###speakerb68.###or you're going *-1 to be observed *-2.###speakera69.###speakerb70.###speakera71.###speakerb72.###yeah.###speakera73.###and i, i don't know how a coach *ich*-4 would feel if, that *t*-1 teaches health or eng-, you know, english, or whatever *t*-3 that they had *-2 to wear a tie.###i,
98908:20	i think, 0 really probably, they could, they could, uh, really,	probably	###uh-huh.###speakera85.###that's what i would think *t*-1.###speakerb86.###but, they, they don't look, you know, they don't wear their sweat pants or, or anything.### they're, they dress like any other teacher would *?* in in a classroom situation, not in p e.###speakera87.###right.###speakerb88.###speakera89.###course, we had, had one coach, 0 one period *t*-1 he'd teach p e and the next period health and then a period of p e###speakerb90.###those i can understand *t*-1.###speakera91.### and, and that's hard.###speakerb92.###yeah.###speakera93.###you know, so he just left warm-ups on,### but, but, uh, no,
98927:8	it certainly makes it *exp*-1 easier * to dress.	certainly	### but, but, uh, no,###i think, 0 really probably, they could, they could, uh, really,###and i don't know if, if they put, make uniforms the thing for the kids,###i guess 0 the teachers will have *-1 to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top###and,###speakerb94.###i don't think 0 we'll ever get to that.###speakera95.###you don't think so.###speakerb96.###no,###i don't think.###i think 0 we're going the opposite direction.###it's the parochial schools that i guess many ti-,###they've had uniforms for years,###i r-, don't really know if they still do.###speakera97.###well, some of them, yes they do### and, and it's not at some of the private schools,###speakerb98.
98934:20	well, it *exp*-2's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run, i think, that you don't have *-1 to be concerned about your wardrobe.	certainly	###speakera95.###you don't think so.###speakerb96.###no,###i don't think.###i think 0 we're going the opposite direction.###it's the parochial schools that i guess many ti-,###they've had uniforms for years,###i r-, don't really know if they still do.###speakera97.###well, some of them, yes they do### and, and it's not at some of the private schools,###speakerb98.###it certainly makes it *exp*-1 easier * to dress.###speakera99.###but even there's a couple public schools in dallas where, where the kids wear uniforms *t*-1 and the teachers, you know, dress in accordance with that *t*-1.###speakerb100.###uh-huh.###speakera101.###speakerb102.
99066:59	and, uh, one thing that i did *t*-1 this summer, which i thought 0 *t*-2 might benefit both my daughters is, 0 my youngest daughter got involved *-3 in band,	might	###i really like it.###speakerb21.###oh, i love it.###speakera22.###speakerb23.###i love it.###i really do.###speakera24.###and your daughter is going *-1 to be a sophomore.###speakerb25.###that's correct.###i have two daughters,###but my oldest will be, will be a sophomore.###speakera26.### is, uh, because you live in austin, is she thinking about the university of texas?###speakerb27.###she has her heart set on u t.###speakera28.###speakerb29.###and, uh, you know, *-1 having gone to the university of minnesota, i know what a big university is like *t*-2.

99095:10	oh, definitely.	definitely	###and, uh, my oldest one just wasn't impressed *ich*-1 at all with the idea of a small school.###so, uh, i, i, i still think 0 the exposure was good.###speakera32.###yes.###speakerb33.###the reason 0 i ask if you went to college *t*-1 is 0 i thought, well, you know,###what were your selection criteria *t*-1.###did you base it on what you wanted *-1 to major in *t*-2 or what you would feel comfortable with *t*-3 or what you could afford *t*-4###or, you know, there's all of these areas 0 * to look at *t*-1 in * making the decision.###speakera34.###uh-huh.### those, and those were several, uh, that we did consider *t*-1.###uh, my parents, uh, certainly didn't push but wanted me to look in the south###and because i had been in a small school, they suggested that i probably, i,###when i say small *t*-1, my graduating class had eighteen in it.###speakerb35.###oh, wow.###speakera36.###and so they suggested that i might want a smaller school because i was used to a lot of one-on-one uh, or small group situations.###speakerb37.
99132:40	uh, and really his, his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand.	probably	###but because i had had a fair amount of french *-1 going in i was able *-2 to do my year's study in france and able *-2 to take a lot of the other courses that *t*-3 interested me.###speakerb43.###uh-huh.###speakera44.###uh, and so that was some of,###speakerb45.###oh, that was, that worked out very well for you.###speakera46.###but###speakerb47.###speakera48.###several of the things 0 you mentioned *t*-1 were the things that, uh, our son has talked *t*-2 a lot about texas a and m.### he, but he thinks 0 he wants *-1 to be a writer###and i don't think that,###speakerb49.###well, then he should come to u t.###speakera50.###yes.###speakerb51.###speakera52.
99147:10	and i definitely felt like i was a number.	definitely	###well, then he should come to u t.###speakera50.###yes.###speakerb51.###speakera52.###uh, and really his, his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand.###speakerb53.###uh-huh.###speakera54.###uh, and so he's used to a bigger size###speakerb55.###large classes.###speakera56.### and because my brother is there, uh, he would have family, close by.###so there, there are advantages.###uh, but i also,###because i had so many friends who *t*-1 did go from our small school to university of michigan, which *t*-2 was so large###and they really felt, uh, like they were numbers.###speakerb57.###oh, i went from a large high school to a u-, large university
99161:31	well, th-, that's certainly,	certainly	###so there, there are advantages.###uh, but i also,###because i had so many friends who *t*-1 did go from our small school to university of michigan, which *t*-2 was so large###and they really felt, uh, like they were numbers.###speakerb57.###oh, i went from a large high school to a u-, large university###and i definitely felt like i was a number.###speakera58.###you still,###speakerb59.###speakera60.###yeah.###speakerb61.###uh, i mean, it is a different feeling.###but that was, that was my only option.### i, i mean, i just really couldn't look at anything else.###that was the one and only thing 0 i could really afford *t*-1 other than a jun-, you know, a junior college, which i didn't want *-2 to do *t*-3.###so that's how, you know, my decision was made *-1 *t*-2.###but, uh,###speakera62.
99226:30	well, the weather has been, certainly has been hot	certainly	###yes.###speakerb73.###i mean, i'm kind of really putting the practical application, you know, and, and saying, yet, * do something that you enjoy *t*-1.###speakera74.###uh-huh.###speakerb75.###by all means, * go *-1 get that piece of paper, you know.###do you just have one son?###speakera76.###yes.###speakerb77.###i see.###well, it sounds like he's got some really, you know, good strong ideas of what he wants *-1 to do *t*-2.###speakera78.###well, he, but he has even,###now that he's in high school, uh,###and, of course, there's, there is still time,###but he's beginning *-1 to feel that, as much as he enjoys writing, he wonders if he can make a living at it.###you know, it's, the, it's,###speakera1.
99245:10	but it certainly, uh,	certainly	###speakera1.###well, the weather has been, certainly has been hot###and it's been humid.###i don't remember a year in a long time that the humidity has stayed up this high for, uh, this late into, uh,###well, it's not really late into the summer,###but the, the humidity has hung around all of june.###speakerb2.###yeah.###are you native to this area?###speakera3.###no,###i grew up in michigan,### so, uh, but i've been, i've been in texas for fifteen years.###speakerb4.###oh, okay.###speakera5.###speakerb6.###uh-huh.###speakera7.### so, uh, but, you know, i know 0 the summers get hot
99301:8	it might rain on your little parade.	might	###i moved here like in late august###and it didn't rain from august until december###and, i went home and told 0 it just doesn't rain in texas.###speakerb18.###speakera19.###i mean it was great after * growing up in michigan### and not, and al-, you know, every day was cloudy,###almost every day was cloudy###and i, you sort of forget how much it did rain *t*-1###and * coming here###and then it didn't rain,###it was just wonderful.###speakerb20.###well, yeah,###see i, i lived in, uh, ohio mainly.###i lived in, uh, pontiac just a little while before i came down here###speakera21.###oh, yeah.###speakerb22.###and, you know, so many times when you were trying *-1 to schedule outdoor activities *t*-2, you just never knew if it was going *-3 to be a go or not because of the weather.
99325:8	you probably know where that is *t*-1 because i know where pontiac is *t*-2,	probably	###speakerb24.###you know, and here it was like, pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime###and you really didn't have too much of a chance of it getting rained out.###speakera25.###yeah.###speakerb26.###you could pretty much do whatever you wanted *-1 to do *t*-2.###speakera27.###that's right.###speakerb28.###what part of michigan were you living in *t*-1?###speakera29.###oh, i grew up in dearborn which *t*-1 is a suburb of, of detroit.###speakerb30.###okay.###speakera31.###speakerb32.###yeah,###yeah.###speakera33.
99392:20	you know, like maybe a mile, two long.	maybe	###i lived to the west of it.###uh, i forget the, the county,###but you know where all the lakes are *t*-1 around there.###speakera51.###okay,###sort of.###speakerb52.###i lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes.###it was real close to where i worked *t*-1.###it was only like four miles to work###and it *exp*-1 was wonderful * being on the lake like that.###you know, in the summer, you feel like you're, you know, on a vacation all the time because you're right on a lake###and everybody's, you know, out enjoying the water and such,###and, uh, in the winter time the lakes froze over,###you could still kind of go *-1 sledding and such out there###but i thought 0 it *exp*-1 was just really neat * to be out there on all those lakes.###there's lots of really small ones out there.###speakera53.###yeah.###speakerb54.
99408:13	so it's probably out in that direction,	probably	###there's lots of really small ones out there.###speakera53.###yeah.###speakerb54.###you know, like maybe a mile, two long.###speakera55.###yeah.###speakerb56.###that's enough * to, uh, do some boating###speakera57.###that's right.###speakerb58.###and it was lots of fun.###speakera59.###that's right.### lake, i think 0 lake whitmore is the only one 0 i have real memories of *t*-1. which *t*-2 is,###speakerb60.###um.###speakera61.###well, i think 0 it's, i think 0 it's toward ann arbor,
99409:29	but that's the only one 0 i probably could name *t*-1 after all these years	probably	###speakera53.###yeah.###speakerb54.###you know, like maybe a mile, two long.###speakera55.###yeah.###speakerb56.###that's enough * to, uh, do some boating###speakera57.###that's right.###speakerb58.###and it was lots of fun.###speakera59.###that's right.### lake, i think 0 lake whitmore is the only one 0 i have real memories of *t*-1. which *t*-2 is,###speakerb60.###um.###speakera61.###well, i think 0 it's, i think 0 it's toward ann arbor,###so it's probably out in that direction,
99427:27	i was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from, from the city limits	maybe	###well, i think 0 it's, i think 0 it's toward ann arbor,###so it's probably out in that direction,###but that's the only one 0 i probably could name *t*-1 after all these years###speakerb62.###uh-huh.###speakera63.### so, but, uh,###speakerb64.###yeah,###yeah.###speakera65.###speakerb66.###but it was, yeah, just lots of little lakes###and, of course, it *exp*-1 was, you know, a little more expensive * to live on the lake,###but i just thought 0 that was grand.###and i think 0 a lot of people didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them,###but there was quite a few lakes all around there.### it seemed like, it was almost like you were living on an island###there was so much water around where i was *t*-1.###i said 0 i wasn't close to downtown pontiac,
99480:39	so but, uh, you know, we probably did some ice skating on it,	probably	###yeah,###yeah.###speakera79.###so those are always fun.###and alpine,###was it alpine 0 *t*-1 was another ski slope that we went to *t*-2,###speakerb80.###uh-huh.###speakera81.###so, uh, it was nice.###speakerb82.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera83.###i always tell people that in the winter we use, we used *-1 to, uh,###my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on, you know, make a pond in the backyard for us.###speakerb84.###oh, yeah,###yeah.###speakera85.
99681:30	and i was thinking, you know 0 maybe i'd help *-1 supplement it, you know when they turned them in *t*-2	maybe	###speakera45.###and so, you know, we don't get paid *-1 for that###but that's okay.###speakerb46.###yeah.###speakera47.###you know, it's, it's not that much of a bother really.###you just have *-1 to rinse out your bottles or whatever###and we use a lot of, two liter bottles. um, and like milk cartons and things like that.###speakerb48.###speakera49.###it *exp*-2's amazing how much plastic you generate *t*-1.###speakerb50.###yeah,###i was amazed at how many cans that we got *t*-1 mumblex###speakera51.###yeah.###yeah.###speakerb52.###because when the kids first went down *t*-1, i said, that, you know that's great
99770:20	proba-, we probably will *?*.	probably	###it's amazing.###speakerb78.###yeah.###speakera79.###yeah.###yeah.###speakerb80.###oh, i like it better *-1 doing it.###well one,###it cuts down on my mow time anyway###speakera81.###uh-huh,###that's true.###speakerb82.###and you zip through it quicker.###speakera83.###that's true.###that's true.###well, i, i really think 0 you're going *-1 to get hooked on plastics and paper before you know it.###speakerb84.
99798:48	and, uh, when you read that *t*-1 you think, well gee, maybe it is a big deal, you know.	maybe	###and then, you know, every few weeks we have recycling, a recycling center like near wal-mart.###speakerb88.###uh-huh.###speakera89.### they're, they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in *t*-1###and it's really no trouble.###speakerb90.###speakera91.###and, uh, i feel like at least we're doing something.###speakerb92.###yeah.###speakera93.###you know, mumblex, um, i read a book one time or a m-, a magazine article###and they said something about how you don't realize 0 even just your small contribution *t*-1,###it seems like a small contribution###but it's not *?*.###if everyone were *-1 to recycle just their newspapers, they would s-, save thousands and thousands of trees a day. a day, just from *-2 not throwing out your newspapers.###speakerb94.###really.###speakera95.
99955:9	and, probably the first question would be whether you've ever had *-1 to go through that process.	probably	###speakerb152.###so,###speakera153.###yeah.###oh, that's a lot of fun.###speakerb154.###yeah.###speakera155.###that's a lot of fun.###well, that's great.###well i'm *-1 to hear 0 you're, doing that.###speakerb156.###speakera157.###i,###my sister *ich*-1 was here recently from connecticut###and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans.###speakerb158.###oh really?.###speakera1.###we're *-1 to discuss a little bit about the process of * putting someone in a nursing home and making the decision on a family basis
100061:7	or probably in college station there wasn't a whole lot of choice.	probably	###speakerb34.###oh, that's too much trouble.###that's too much trouble.###* didn't want *-1 to cook.###speakera35.###and the portions,###people don't want *-1 to try *-2 to figure out little bitty individual meals.###i do that right now,###speakerb36.###yeah.###speakera37.###and i'm not near nursing home age.###speakerb38.###although they've got, uh, meals on wheels, which i understand 0 *t*-1 is a really good, you know, way 0 * to handle that so that at least they eat *t*-2.###speakera39.###yeah.###speakerb40.###speakera41.###uh-huh.###so as a family you all just visited nursing homes
100166:19	in fact, that's probably what *t*-1's going *-2 to happen with my husband's mother.	probably	###it seems like the women out just out live their husbands, but, very reluctantly,###that whole, i mean###speakera71.###uh-huh.###speakerb72.###they don't get out of the house,###they don't socialize###but it's my home###and i don't want *-1 to leave it.###speakera73.###well and it's the first step in, in * actually accepting that you are failing and, and aging.###speakerb74.###uh.###speakera75.###you know once you make that step you know that it's just going *-1 to be downhill from then on### and, and i've seen people *ich*-1 really fight it that *t*-2 desperately needed *-3 to make the change.###speakerb76.###um.###speakera77.### they, they became,
100167:43	she's going *-1 to endanger herself before she'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision.	probably	###that whole, i mean###speakera71.###uh-huh.###speakerb72.###they don't get out of the house,###they don't socialize###but it's my home###and i don't want *-1 to leave it.###speakera73.###well and it's the first step in, in * actually accepting that you are failing and, and aging.###speakerb74.###uh.###speakera75.###you know once you make that step you know that it's just going *-1 to be downhill from then on### and, and i've seen people *ich*-1 really fight it that *t*-2 desperately needed *-3 to make the change.###speakerb76.###um.###speakera77.### they, they became,###in fact, that's probably what *t*-1's going *-2 to happen with my husband's mother.
100271:17	so we thought 0 maybe we could get them to move a little closer here.	maybe	###speakera111.###and we can't see her often enough *-1 to really know what *t*-2's going on.###speakerb112.###um.###speakera113.###so, it's difficult,###it really is *?*###and we're all heading that way###and,###speakerb114.###yeah,###my, husband and i, we have been thinking about###his folks are in college station###speakera115.###speakerb116.###and we've pretty much planned that we'll be here in the dallas area###and there's nothing 0 *t*-1 to hold them there in college station since they're retired.###speakera117.###uh-huh.###speakerb118.
100319:25	and and it would certainly help the country, too, uh.	certainly	###speakera12.###i just, um,###i guess 0 that's mumblex, my, that's something that my family has always believed strongly in *t*-1,###and, uh, i had opportunities in high school, * to work in some programs, um###speakerb13.###speakera14.###speakerb15.###did you?###oh!.###speakera16.### and, and i agree with what you said *t*-1 that it's, uh, it benefits the person doing it so much 0 i don't think 0 they realize###speakerb17.###speakera18.###speakerb19.###uh-huh.###speakera20.###and i, uh, i, i think 0 it gives you a better perspective, on life###speakerb21.###speakera22.###and, uh, it gives you a little bit, uh, more a glimpse of the, the real world
100326:21	i think 0 that's probably like, uh, quite a few things that, that the kids, uh, maybe not so much nowadays but used *-1 to go through *t*-2, you know,	probably	###did you?###oh!.###speakera16.### and, and i agree with what you said *t*-1 that it's, uh, it benefits the person doing it so much 0 i don't think 0 they realize###speakerb17.###speakera18.###speakerb19.###uh-huh.###speakera20.###and i, uh, i, i think 0 it gives you a better perspective, on life###speakerb21.###speakera22.###and, uh, it gives you a little bit, uh, more a glimpse of the, the real world### and and it would certainly help the country, too, uh.###speakerb23.###yeah.###speakera24.###speakerb25.###really.###yeah,
100326:77	i think 0 that's probably like, uh, quite a few things that, that the kids, uh, maybe not so much nowadays but used *-1 to go through *t*-2, you know,	maybe	###did you?###oh!.###speakera16.### and, and i agree with what you said *t*-1 that it's, uh, it benefits the person doing it so much 0 i don't think 0 they realize###speakerb17.###speakera18.###speakerb19.###uh-huh.###speakera20.###and i, uh, i, i think 0 it gives you a better perspective, on life###speakerb21.###speakera22.###and, uh, it gives you a little bit, uh, more a glimpse of the, the real world### and and it would certainly help the country, too, uh.###speakerb23.###yeah.###speakera24.###speakerb25.###really.###yeah,
100348:11	that's probably true. you know	probably	###yeah.###speakerb27.### they, just, they were, they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, their, uh, families, for their friends, where now, i'm not sure 0 they really do *t*-1.###speakera28.###yes.###speakerb29.###speakera30.###yeah.###well, i think 0 sometimes through groups and organizations, um,### my first, when i first thought of it *t*-1, i thought 0 it, uh, when they asked the question *t*-2 i thought, well that sounds wonderful.###and then, i wondered if people were unwilling### but, but i think 0 even if you went in with a negative attitude i don't think 0 it would stay negative very long.###um, but i do know 0 through some organized groups like scouts and church um, they, do still have opportunities.###speakerb31.###uh-huh.###speakera32.###speakerb33.###speakera34.###speakerb35.###yeah,
100352:63	but even, even through those groups, do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used *-1 to *?*?	maybe	###yes.###speakerb29.###speakera30.###yeah.###well, i think 0 sometimes through groups and organizations, um,### my first, when i first thought of it *t*-1, i thought 0 it, uh, when they asked the question *t*-2 i thought, well that sounds wonderful.###and then, i wondered if people were unwilling### but, but i think 0 even if you went in with a negative attitude i don't think 0 it would stay negative very long.###um, but i do know 0 through some organized groups like scouts and church um, they, do still have opportunities.###speakerb31.###uh-huh.###speakera32.###speakerb33.###speakera34.###speakerb35.###yeah,###that's probably true. you know###speakera36.###but, i, i think 0 that's a small, uh, number 0 *t*-1 could,###speakerb37.
100363:21	i think 0 that's probably true.	probably	###speakera32.###speakerb33.###speakera34.###speakerb35.###yeah,###that's probably true. you know###speakera36.###but, i, i think 0 that's a small, uh, number 0 *t*-1 could,###speakerb37.###but even, even through those groups, do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used *-1 to *?*?###speakera38.###no,###um, not since, um, not as much as i remember *-1 growing up.###and that was something, uh, i think 0 *t*-1 in the fifties and sixties, um,###* seemed more common in the last two decades.###speakerb39.###uh-huh.###speakera40.###speakerb41.###yeah.
100367:21	i think 0 it's probably more true *ich*-1 *ich*-2, still in the, in the smaller communities then in the larger cities.	probably	###yeah,###that's probably true. you know###speakera36.###but, i, i think 0 that's a small, uh, number 0 *t*-1 could,###speakerb37.###but even, even through those groups, do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used *-1 to *?*?###speakera38.###no,###um, not since, um, not as much as i remember *-1 growing up.###and that was something, uh, i think 0 *t*-1 in the fifties and sixties, um,###* seemed more common in the last two decades.###speakerb39.###uh-huh.###speakera40.###speakerb41.###yeah.###i think 0 that's probably true.###speakera42.###but,###speakerb43.
100411:11	and maybe, uh, maybe this would be a way 0 * to get that feeling back *t*-1. um, if we've lost some of that	maybe	###speakera52.###speakerb53.###gosh,###i hadn't even thought about it being out of the area###but you're right.###yeah.###i grew up in a real small town in florida.###speakera54.###oh.###speakerb55.###i mean a real small town.###and, uh, i think 0 it was just mumblex,###of course it was back in the, in the fifties###and i think 0 it was real prevalent back then.### i mumblex, i think 0 people thought more *ich*-1 of others than they do now. you know, as far as *-2 doing things for them and, and then gaining benefits from it.###speakera56.###yeah.###speakerb57.###speakera58.###well,
100411:24	and maybe, uh, maybe this would be a way 0 * to get that feeling back *t*-1. um, if we've lost some of that	maybe	###speakera52.###speakerb53.###gosh,###i hadn't even thought about it being out of the area###but you're right.###yeah.###i grew up in a real small town in florida.###speakera54.###oh.###speakerb55.###i mean a real small town.###and, uh, i think 0 it was just mumblex,###of course it was back in the, in the fifties###and i think 0 it was real prevalent back then.### i mumblex, i think 0 people thought more *ich*-1 of others than they do now. you know, as far as *-2 doing things for them and, and then gaining benefits from it.###speakera56.###yeah.###speakerb57.###speakera58.###well,
100413:5	maybe that's a way,	maybe	###gosh,###i hadn't even thought about it being out of the area###but you're right.###yeah.###i grew up in a real small town in florida.###speakera54.###oh.###speakerb55.###i mean a real small town.###and, uh, i think 0 it was just mumblex,###of course it was back in the, in the fifties###and i think 0 it was real prevalent back then.### i mumblex, i think 0 people thought more *ich*-1 of others than they do now. you know, as far as *-2 doing things for them and, and then gaining benefits from it.###speakera56.###yeah.###speakerb57.###speakera58.###well,###and maybe, uh, maybe this would be a way 0 * to get that feeling back *t*-1. um, if we've lost some of that###and it, it seems 0 in the last decade or two, um, that's true,
100414:50	if, if young people had *-1 to do it um, maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things 0 i always thought 0 *t*-2 was a wonderful part of our country. um, is * helping others.	maybe	###i hadn't even thought about it being out of the area###but you're right.###yeah.###i grew up in a real small town in florida.###speakera54.###oh.###speakerb55.###i mean a real small town.###and, uh, i think 0 it was just mumblex,###of course it was back in the, in the fifties###and i think 0 it was real prevalent back then.### i mumblex, i think 0 people thought more *ich*-1 of others than they do now. you know, as far as *-2 doing things for them and, and then gaining benefits from it.###speakera56.###yeah.###speakerb57.###speakera58.###well,###and maybe, uh, maybe this would be a way 0 * to get that feeling back *t*-1. um, if we've lost some of that###and it, it seems 0 in the last decade or two, um, that's true,###maybe that's a way,
100446:31	you know, i think 0 this is certainly a possible way, um, 0 * to handle it *t*-1	certainly	###speakera64.###yeah.###speakerb65.### i, i don't know how young you'd have *-2 to go *t*-1###but i think 0 by the time 0 they're, oh, early teenagers anyway *t*-1, i think 0 it's too late now. at least around here.###speakera66.###yeah,### i think, uh, i think 0 it does help, um, even preschoolers, you know###they're, um, things even just * starting around the home. you know###speakerb67.###right.###speakera68.###little ones can do a little bit *-1 to help the family.###speakerb69.###uh-huh.###speakera70.### and, and just * watching the parents do things too, um, it can start a pattern.###there's always something, no matter how young,###and then that helps *-1 develop that attitude.###um, i guess 0 i would really like *-1 to see this happen with families more.
100466:11	that's probably true.	probably	###you know, i think 0 this is certainly a possible way, um, 0 * to handle it *t*-1###but i wish, mumblex###that's something that i think that *t*-1 has been lost *-2 in families###and i think 0 that's a good place 0 * to start again *t*-1.###speakerb71.###yeah.###i think 0 it has *-1 to start in the families first because if you don't do it for, for your own immediate family, you're sure not going *-2 to do it for anybody else.###speakera72.###yeah.###and i do think, um, 0 the schools,###if you're trying *-1 to do something, even with food drives###and, uh, sometimes what richardson and plano both,###i mean when you live in areas like that where there's so much *t*-2 *t*-3 they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is *t*-1.###speakerb73.###uh-huh.###speakera74.###i mean, that's, uh,###gosh i'm sure, 0 not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas###and, uh it's,###speakerb75.
100467:11	that's probably true.	probably	###but i wish, mumblex###that's something that i think that *t*-1 has been lost *-2 in families###and i think 0 that's a good place 0 * to start again *t*-1.###speakerb71.###yeah.###i think 0 it has *-1 to start in the families first because if you don't do it for, for your own immediate family, you're sure not going *-2 to do it for anybody else.###speakera72.###yeah.###and i do think, um, 0 the schools,###if you're trying *-1 to do something, even with food drives###and, uh, sometimes what richardson and plano both,###i mean when you live in areas like that where there's so much *t*-2 *t*-3 they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is *t*-1.###speakerb73.###uh-huh.###speakera74.###i mean, that's, uh,###gosh i'm sure, 0 not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas###and, uh it's,###speakerb75.###that's probably true.
100710:8	it certainly is *?*.	certainly	###and i think 0 that would give them more security in * going to the counselor.###speakera69.###uh-huh.###speakerb70.###if they have a rapport with their counselor.###now if they don't, i hope 0 they have the flexibility * to be able *-1 to change a child that *t*-2 really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse *-3 to work with them.###speakera71.###speakerb72.###speakera73.###* to change,###yeah.###speakerb74.###and occasionally that happens.###speakera75.###right.###speakerb76.###but, it is frightening### b-, because, uh, education is the key to our future###speakera77.###yes,
101608:39	and, and, you know, basically it certainly a l-, low calorie, you know, good thing except then you put your mayonnaise in there and spoil the whole thing.	certainly	###i bet 0 the mayonnaise in there makes it really, kind of gives it a tang that *t*-1 would be good.###speakerb152.###yeah,###it gives it a, an extra yeah, little tang.###speakera153.###speakerb154.###speakera155.###i guess 0 i would now use the, the new mayonnaise free.###speakerb156.###yeah,###that cholesterol fat free?###speakera157.###yeah.###that's really wonderful that they're coming out with so many new things like that because like i told my husband this summer, 0 i love *-1 to eat, you know, chicken salad and tuna salad and stuff like that###speakerb158.###uh-huh.###speakera159.###speakerb160.###uh-huh.###speakera161.
101715:26	well, i think 0 we've probably talked long enough	probably	###he's never eaten any eggs.###he's never had anything but skim milk###and you know, i've never bought butter and things like that.###speakerb202.###huh.###speakera203.###but, um, oh, he just left for the doctor again###and it's, it's kind of back up.###um, so he needs *-1 to be careful again.###speakerb204.###yeah.###speakera205.###so we've really been talking about the foods, you know, 0 for him to, to be sure *-2 to eat *t*-1###speakerb206.###the lower cholesterol foods and stuff.###speakera207.###and, uh, so he's eating an apple a day for the last two days.###speakerb208.###speakera209.###and all that kind of stuff does really help.
101764:8	i definitely,	definitely	###so,###speakera12.###um, * let's see.###speakerb13.### s-, social changes,###speakera14.###social changes.###speakerb15.###what's that mean *t*-1?.###speakera16.###that sounds like not as recent social changes *ich*-2, too, like back to the sixties or fifties, i guess 0 *t*-1.###speakerb17.###yeah.###speakera18.###* think 0 we can handle that?###speakerb19.###yeah.###speakera20.###speakerb21.###yeah,
101858:121	and, i, i think that if they didn't *?* that, and it became more of the standard * not to *?* that, uh, i don't know maybe companies would start *-1 paying men more so that their wives could stay home. you know? and have a more solid, uh, foundation for the kids.	maybe	###speakerb47.###speakera48.###yeah.###speakerb49.###speakera50.###speakerb51.###speakera52.###yeah.###oh it's,###speakerb53.###well that, that, i mean that's very, young for a baby.###speakera54.###that's really sad.###i think that a lot of people,###and they think 0 they have *-1 to *?*###but,###speakerb55.###yeah.###speakera56.### i, i think that if they really tried, they wouldn't have *-1 to *?*.
101868:46	like you said, i mean, there's, they might be saving money,	might	###well that, that, i mean that's very, young for a baby.###speakera54.###that's really sad.###i think that a lot of people,###and they think 0 they have *-1 to *?*###but,###speakerb55.###yeah.###speakera56.### i, i think that if they really tried, they wouldn't have *-1 to *?*.###and, i, i think that if they didn't *?* that, and it became more of the standard * not to *?* that, uh, i don't know maybe companies would start *-1 paying men more so that their wives could stay home. you know? and have a more solid, uh, foundation for the kids.###speakerb57.###yeah.###speakera58.###speakerb59.###yeah.###speakera60.###speakerb61.###yeah.###i mean they're going *-1 to,
101898:9	or, maybe there's a small need for money	maybe	###* trying *-1 to do all these programs like headstart and things like those. you wouldn't have *-2 to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them, you know.###speakerb67.###yeah.###speakera68.###um, there's,###and i think, uh, 0 a lot of it is selfishness.###people have become very selfish.###they don't want *-1 to stay home with the kids or something like that.###speakerb69.### y-, yeah.###speakera70.###there are a lot of two parent, um, situations where the woman goes back to work because that's what she wants *-1 to do *t*-2 *t*-3, you know.###speakerb71.###oh rather than she needs the money just she wants the stimulating environment.###speakera72.###rather than that, she has *-1 to have the money particularly.###speakerb73.###speakera74.###speakerb75.###speakera76.
101963:7	and maybe part of that is * educating parents better.	maybe	### it, it's really obvious *ich*-3 * to look at them and watch the way 0 they act *t*-2 and things. that, um, they've been raised *-1 in a day-care center.###speakerb97.###yeah.###speakera98.###speakerb99.###yeah.###that's pretty sad because, i mean, i don't know, something's got *-1 to change with the schools.###that's what it all boils down to *t*-1 in the end, usually anyway.###speakera100.###well, i think 0 it's going *-1 to, change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else.###speakerb101.###when they're young *t*-1,###speakera102.###speakerb103.###yeah.###speakera104.###the home is the base,###it's the basic unit.###and that's the, where it all starts *t*-1###and if we don't start *-1 making changes in the homes
102041:17	and, uh, we probably go out one to two times a week.	probably	###speakera21.###speakerb22.###speakera23.###this is our night out.### so but, uh, anyway, where do you like *-1 to eat *t*-2?###speakerb24.###uh, well, uh, we don't have any children###so, uh, we tend *-1 to, like *-2 to try all sorts of different things.###speakera25.###speakerb26.###and, uh, we're very attracted *-1 to exotic food.###speakera27.###uh-huh.###speakerb28.###and, uh, we like indian food, and thai cuisine and, uh, sort of gourmet mexican and, uh, things like that, as well as tex-mex and italian and, uh, chinese and things, and, and things of that sort.###now, yes,###of course, we like *-1 to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers or something like that, too.###speakera29.###right.###speakerb30.
102153:17	but we've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons, and the other half through the, through the newspaper reviews.	probably	###speakerb66.###when a new restaurant opens up *t*-1, they usually send out coupons.###speakera67.### that's, that's right.###speakerb68.###and you know, when they say, you know, *-1 buy one * get one free *t*-2. it's hard 0 * to resist *t*-3,###speakera69.###speakerb70.###speakera71.###speakerb72.###so we'll go in.###and very often we'll, find a place that we like *t*-1###speakera73.###speakerb74.###and we'll stick with it###once they, give, they no longer give coupons. we'll, we'll, uh, we'll stay there.###speakera75.###oh good.###oh, good.###speakerb76.
102260:11	i would probably like that.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakera117.### it just, we've, we've taken people there several times###and, uh, they have a good, they have a good choice of things that *t*-1 are very different sounding.###i guess, 0 it's,###whether you call it southwestern###but, uh, oh we had venison venison chili *ich*-2 one time. which *t*-1 was absolutely wonderful.###speakerb118.###ooh.###speakera119.###and then i guess 0 it must be seasonal###and we've been back,###oh, i guess 0 it's in the winter season###well they've never had it when we've been back *t*-1,###speakerb120.###uh-huh.###speakera121.### so. but, uh, well you ought *-1 to try that.### it's, it's, it's very good.###speakerb122.
102354:13	but i go maybe once every couple of months.	maybe	###speakerb21.###oh.###speakera22.###and so since he had this friend up from houston, uh, and his friend had already seen so many and i thought 0 they decided on this and i thought well, i want *-1 to see this one, too.###so, we, uh, i###speakerb23.###yeah.###speakera24.###finally, it's my first summer movie.###speakerb25.###oh my.###well, * let me see.###was it,###well, we went *-1 to see one hundred and one dalmatians last weekend###and that may be,###no,###right before i went in the hospital my girlfriend said * come on,###we're going to the movies.###and we won't,###well she goes all the time
102616:27	my parents took me when i was probably somewhere between ashley and jamie's age *t*-1.	probably	###i do, too.###i think 0 he's really good.###speakera114.###and he's very good in regarding henry.###that's not an easy part 0 * to play *t*-1, i, i don't think 0 *t*-2.###speakerb115.###i wouldn't think 0 *?*.###well, my kids are going to their dad's tomorrow night###so i sort of think 0 i may go *-1 do that.###speakera116.###yeah.### that's at, that one won't your sides.###speakerb117.###good.###speakera118.###um, it,###was this the first time 0 you got *-1 to see one hundred and one dalmatians *t*-2?###or,###speakerb119.###i hav-,
103056:74	i think, uh, 0 air isn't as bad *ich*-1 0 it once was *?*, from the cars, because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area.	certainly	###i haven't *?* either.###speakera13.###speakerb14.###uh-huh.###speakera15.###and,###speakerb16.###well, i think 0 it *exp*-1 would be terrible * to live in an area like that###and, unfortunately, i think 0 there are a lot of areas that *t*-1 are, that, that bad.###speakera17.###yeah.###speakerb18.###particularly in the areas where there are industries *t*-1, uh, where they are burning a lot of coal, and oil *t*-3 up, more up north, i guess *t*-2, uh,###speakera19.###yes.###speakerb20.###speakera21.###yeah.###speakerb22.###i think 0 it's a bigger problem. with the car pollution, anti-pollution devices,
103172:63	it's just, you know, a possible solution in the future, i think 0 *t*-1, * maybe to help in some ways.	maybe	###speakera51.###and we have enough clouds that, uh,###there are other areas that *t*-1 would be better suited.###that surprised me because i think, 0 we have a tremendous amount of, um, sunny days.###speakerb52.###speakera53.###speakerb54.###speakera55.### and, and it,###yes,###it can be used *-1###and it can help###but, uh, that was a problem that they were still working *t*-1 on.###but,###speakerb56.###oh yeah.### it, it's still got a long way 0 * to go *t*-1.###speakera57.###well i,###speakerb58.
103192:80	i, i think, 0 with * solving some of the energy, future energy problems, we'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well.	probably	###it's just, you know, a possible solution in the future, i think 0 *t*-1, * maybe to help in some ways.###speakera59.###yes.###speakerb60.###it may not *?* in all ways.###maybe they'll come up with fusion. you know, con-, be able *-1 to control it.###i don't know how long that'll take *t*-1,###but, one of these days,###because that's perfectly clean.###speakera61.###yes.###speakerb62.###it's just 0 we can't control it.###right now it *exp*-1 takes more energy *ich*-2 * to cause fusion to occur then you get *?* out,###so, it isn't *?*,###not at all,###and you can't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field,###so that's not going *-1 to work.###at least not now.###but, uh, who *t*-1 knows what the future will hold *t*-2. uh, as far as energy goes,
103284:15	you know, maybe there is *?*,	maybe	###speakerb13.###speakera14.###but then i thought about it###and i thought, well, the loss that i would feel *t*-1 at *-2 losing my mother someone else would feel that about that person###no matter how rotten they were *t*-2, somebody loves them.###speakerb15.###yeah,###it would never be equal,###speakera16.###speakerb17.###right.###speakera18.###speakerb19.###right.###yeah.###speakera20.###how about you?###speakerb21.###well, i guess, you know, i, i guess 0 i can see it from several different perspectives,###but, you know when i hear about things like, you know, what they've, what they've been reporting about *t*-1 in milwaukee, you know *t*-2 i, i, to me i don't see any way of * rehabilitating the guy.
103466:7	and maybe that's why, one of the reasons why crime has gone up *t*-1, because it's not so scary anymore.	maybe	###speakera82.###but she said, uh, you know, 0 in prison you can get anything.###you can any drugs 0 you want *t*-1.###there's,### it, it's just like * being outside.###you know, people find ways around.###speakerb83.###really.###speakera84.###and there's a power structure that you have bow to *t*-1### and, and, it really isn't, for some people tha-, who *t*-1 have been there for over, and over, and over, it really isn't, uh, as bad.###i mean, there's,###it's not that bad of a life as it should be *?* b-, for the punishment aspect.###speakerb85.###yeah.###speakera86.###speakerb87.###yeah.###speakera88.###but the society is turned *-1 against punishment and more towards rehabilitation
103511:115	but i, i really think that in, in terms of like this, i'd, i think that it, it might not be such a bad thing. because, i don't know that anybody, w-, in-, i don't know that anybody would feel good, you know, like if you let someone like that loose in your community.	might	###and she picked up the phone###and when she heard the topic *t*-1, she said, capital punishment,###so she was, uh,###speakera96.###* handed it to you?###speakerb97.###yeah,###well luckily it was for me. because they want, th-, they coordinate the times so it can, only be one or the other.###speakera98.###speakerb99.###speakera100.###oh, oh, i see.###speakerb101.###so, she tried *-1 to enter her number###and it wouldn't work###so she said, whew, it's for you.###speakera102.###speakerb103.### so, but, uh, you know, i don't know,### i, i struggle with it,
103515:10	well, maybe if they could, uh, if they had more money or more, more resources 0 * to work more on rehabilitation *t*-1,	maybe	###* handed it to you?###speakerb97.###yeah,###well luckily it was for me. because they want, th-, they coordinate the times so it can, only be one or the other.###speakera98.###speakerb99.###speakera100.###oh, oh, i see.###speakerb101.###so, she tried *-1 to enter her number###and it wouldn't work###so she said, whew, it's for you.###speakera102.###speakerb103.### so, but, uh, you know, i don't know,### i, i struggle with it,###but i, i really think that in, in terms of like this, i'd, i think that it, it might not be such a bad thing. because, i don't know that anybody, w-, in-, i don't know that anybody would feel good, you know, like if you let someone like that loose in your community.###you know, i, i, i'm su-,###you'd have *-1 to be scared to death.###speakera104.
103525:10	uh, probably the favorite instrument would be, uh, the violin.	probably	###and it wouldn't work###so she said, whew, it's for you.###speakera102.###speakerb103.### so, but, uh, you know, i don't know,### i, i struggle with it,###but i, i really think that in, in terms of like this, i'd, i think that it, it might not be such a bad thing. because, i don't know that anybody, w-, in-, i don't know that anybody would feel good, you know, like if you let someone like that loose in your community.###you know, i, i, i'm su-,###you'd have *-1 to be scared to death.###speakera104.###well, maybe if they could, uh, if they had more money or more, more resources 0 * to work more on rehabilitation *t*-1,###i mean, deep down i think 0 every, every human,###speakera1.###well, my favorite type of music is classical music,###and, uh, i, i enjoy orchestral classical music###and i enjoy classical guitar and classical piano, you know,###and that's, those are, that's my favorite type.###speakerb2.###well,###speakera3.
103535:171	i guess 0 i enjoy, i enjoy jazz, * listening to jazz sometime although i don't feel like i have a good, g-, good understanding of it, or a good, a good feel for maybe what *t*-1's good jazz and what *t*-2's not,	maybe	###well, maybe if they could, uh, if they had more money or more, more resources 0 * to work more on rehabilitation *t*-1,###i mean, deep down i think 0 every, every human,###speakera1.###well, my favorite type of music is classical music,###and, uh, i, i enjoy orchestral classical music###and i enjoy classical guitar and classical piano, you know,###and that's, those are, that's my favorite type.###speakerb2.###well,###speakera3.###uh, probably the favorite instrument would be, uh, the violin.###speakerb4.###oh, well my favorite, well,### i, i don't really have a favorite,### i, i like everything basically.###um, i guess 0 if i had *-1 to pick, it would be like pop, i would think,###but i like everything.###so, it *exp*-1's kind of hard * to choose sometimes.###speakera5.###yeah, you know.
103884:10	well, maybe they don't.	maybe	###speakerb120.###yeah.###speakera121.###so, it's been fun.###speakerb122.###i don't know if any of mine will be interested in it###or...###speakera1.###okay.###well, * let's see,###well, we keep our paper, paper bags lined *-1 up in the garage for glass and, glass and, uh, plastics###and, uh, we make the dump over to the wal-mart bins there as soon as they're full.###i guess 0 we collect m-, milk cartons and whatever p-, other plastics *t*-1 are acceptable.###speakerb2.###are you in the part of town where, uh, they have gotten into the other containers *ich*-1 yet for recycling *t*-2?###speakera3.###no,###no,###i didn't think that anybody had those at all yet.###speakerb4.
104004:31	they'd be, i don't know, maybe ten ounce or six ounce or ten ounce. sort of a small size, sort of a small size	maybe	###and so outside my little town, we would, uh, go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something.###speakera39.###speakerb40.###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###speakera43.###right.###do you know, 0 i saw in tom thumb yesterday, i saw the return to the, uh, the small coke bottles.###speakerb44.###yeah.###speakera45.###and i don't know if there's a deposit on those or not.###speakerb46.###i,###well that's interesting because,###they're back to glass, you're saying 0 *t*-1?###speakera47.### they were glass, they were the glass, uh,###well, * let's see,
104030:7	but certainly we were doing things the way 0 we think 0 we should do them now *t*-1.	certainly	###yeah.###speakera51.### but, and they were packed *-1 in the old sort of six pack * stick them down, you know, uh sort of, sort of a basket type thing.###speakerb52.###uh-huh.###speakera53.###speakerb54.### the carton. the paper carton.###speakera55.###speakerb56.###speakera57.###right,###right,###so, i hadn't seen that in a long time.###speakerb58.###yeah.###well, i mean the,###you really look and say 0 a lot of the things 0 we need *-3 to do *t*-1, we were doing *t*-2###and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons, the wood, uh, racks which now, basically, you could turn *t*-1 them into the plastic ones that *t*-2 would hold, uh, twenty-four bottles.### and, and, uh, uh, i'm not really say going back to good old days,
104073:13	but it's certainly usable material.	certainly	###speakerb66.###speakera67.###right,###right.###speakerb68.###uh, so i'm glad 0 the city's willing *-1 to take that on.###speakera69.###that's nice.###i guess 0 they dump it the same place,###i wonder where they dump that *t*-1.###speakerb70.###well, there's someplace, you know,###if it's,###because really, when i look at what my grass does *t*-1 in, in actually about twenty-four hours *t*-3, uh, *-4 knowing what the farmers do *t*-2 in rural areas,###they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it###and it naturally, uh, composts or stores###and, uh, so all 0 you have *-1 to do *t*-2 is * just place it somewhere and churn it###and it will naturally decompose, uh,###so you just have *-1 to kind of keep in separated###and then, uh, who *t*-1 knows how they process it from there *t*-2 and what they turn it into *t*-3,
104093:52	but, uh, you know, the last movies that i've seen *t*-1 were probably on video.	probably	###but it's certainly usable material.###speakera71.###yeah,###yeah,###well they must, they must keep it separate if they have this date in.###speakerb72.###uh-huh.###speakera73.###they have this day *ich*-2 now, that *t*-1 it's, you know, separate from the other trash pick up.###speakerb74.###right.###but, i, the thing 0 i don't understand *t*-1 about that is, like when,###it *exp*-1's one thing * to send grass there,###but i've trimmed trees and other things which, uh, *t*-1 end up *-3 being something that, *t*-2 clearly won't decompose nearly as rapidly,###speakera75.###no.###speakera1.###i really haven't seen any movies lately,###so when the computer picked this one *t*-1, i was a little bit surprised,###but, i think 0 i haven't been to the movie theater here in about, oh, six months,
104208:15	i guess 0 maybe it would have been better if we'd have been at the theater as opposed to, uh, * just at the house watching it with, with no one else around.	maybe	###supposed * to be his, uh, his debut in comedy.###speakera39.###uh-huh.###speakerb40.###which *t*-1 was an interesting movie, but not very funny.###speakera41.###yeah.###i know 0 my daughter saw that###and she liked it###so,###speakerb42.###did she?###speakera43.###yeah.###speakerb44.###well, it was, it was an amusing movie.###speakera45.###uh-huh.###speakerb46.###it j-,,
104295:18	i thought 0 that might be kind of fun 0 * to do *t*-1.	might	###and, uh, there's so much out on video *ich*-1 now, that it's almost, you know,###the movie comes out quicker than you can go *-1 see it. sometimes.###speakera75.###uh-huh.###speakerb76.###speakera77.###that's right.###and then they go to the dollar movies.###speakerb78.###so.###speakera79.###speakerb80.###uh-huh.###that seems *-1 to happen.###i noticed that dances with wolves was playing at the, uh, granada theater.###speakera81.###uh-huh.###speakerb82.###and, uh, someone said 0 that was a lot of fun 0 * to go *-1 do *t*-2.###you can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie.
104364:64	--ing seems *-1 to be a, a topic that *t*-2's going *-3 to probably take about a generation *ich*-5 *-4 to, uh, catch on, it seems 0 *t*-6, or maybe a generation to two.	probably	###speakerb100.###uh-huh.###speakera101.###oh, okay.###speakerb102.###yeah,###that's the one.###speakera103.###okay,###yeah.###another movie that i want *-1 to see *t*-2 if it ever comes out on video so i can see it without my daughter around is, uh, oh,###i just forgot the title of it.###uh. oh, it's supposed *-1 to be a real scary one.###uh, darn,###well, here, here's *t*-2 another one that i've seen *t*-1.###i saw, uh,###i can't remember the title of it, either.###speakerb104.###* must have left an impression.###speakera1.
104364:123	--ing seems *-1 to be a, a topic that *t*-2's going *-3 to probably take about a generation *ich*-5 *-4 to, uh, catch on, it seems 0 *t*-6, or maybe a generation to two.	maybe	###speakerb100.###uh-huh.###speakera101.###oh, okay.###speakerb102.###yeah,###that's the one.###speakera103.###okay,###yeah.###another movie that i want *-1 to see *t*-2 if it ever comes out on video so i can see it without my daughter around is, uh, oh,###i just forgot the title of it.###uh. oh, it's supposed *-1 to be a real scary one.###uh, darn,###well, here, here's *t*-2 another one that i've seen *t*-1.###i saw, uh,###i can't remember the title of it, either.###speakerb104.###* must have left an impression.###speakera1.
104402:29	i read in the paper this week where maybe,	maybe	###it just really wasn't worth it.###speakerb4.###and a lot of hassle all year round###and cans laying,###speakera5.###yeah.###speakerb6.###yeah.###speakera7.###so, they, they realized, you know,###well, of course to them *ich*-1 a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old.### that wasn't, uh, that was a big deal,###but we decided 0 it wasn't worth us keeping it###and then, uh, t i started *-1 keeping up with, uh, cans there,###so occasionally i'll bring whatever *ich*-2 i've got *t*-1 laying around the car or the like and throw them in there.###least it gets back into the system,###but, as far as a habit at the house, uh, i haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants *-2 to pick *t*-1 up.###have you all got the individual containers yet?###speakerb8.###no,
104404:15	i guess 0 maybe this week someone may start *-1 getting them if the truck that *t*-2 picks them up is outfitted *-3 in time.	maybe	###and a lot of hassle all year round###and cans laying,###speakera5.###yeah.###speakerb6.###yeah.###speakera7.###so, they, they realized, you know,###well, of course to them *ich*-1 a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old.### that wasn't, uh, that was a big deal,###but we decided 0 it wasn't worth us keeping it###and then, uh, t i started *-1 keeping up with, uh, cans there,###so occasionally i'll bring whatever *ich*-2 i've got *t*-1 laying around the car or the like and throw them in there.###least it gets back into the system,###but, as far as a habit at the house, uh, i haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants *-2 to pick *t*-1 up.###have you all got the individual containers yet?###speakerb8.###no,###i read in the paper this week where maybe,###i don't know if it w-, was,
104408:51	but, it, it should be starting, i would stay probably in the next month if, if everything goes that,	probably	###speakerb6.###yeah.###speakera7.###so, they, they realized, you know,###well, of course to them *ich*-1 a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old.### that wasn't, uh, that was a big deal,###but we decided 0 it wasn't worth us keeping it###and then, uh, t i started *-1 keeping up with, uh, cans there,###so occasionally i'll bring whatever *ich*-2 i've got *t*-1 laying around the car or the like and throw them in there.###least it gets back into the system,###but, as far as a habit at the house, uh, i haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants *-2 to pick *t*-1 up.###have you all got the individual containers yet?###speakerb8.###no,###i read in the paper this week where maybe,###i don't know if it w-, was,###i guess 0 maybe this week someone may start *-1 getting them if the truck that *t*-2 picks them up is outfitted *-3 in time.###speakera9.###um.###speakerb10.
104480:44	i, i think 0 kids don't appreciate, maybe the value of money, that it's so little that they don't care,	maybe	###speakera27.###yeah.###speakerb28.###speakera29.###they don't do that.###we live next to a set of railroad tracks###and it *exp*-3 seemed *-1 to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there, by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try *-2 to crash, you know break them,###speakerb30.###uh-huh.###speakera31.###but, uh, they weren't that successful,###so there were a lot of bottles 0 *t*-1 to be returned *-2###and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough * to buy whatever we wanted *t*-1 for the day###speakerb32.###uh-huh.###speakera33.###and,###speakerb34.###yeah,###and they, uh, p-,
104489:41	the nickels, the dimes or what, i suppose 0 it might be quarters, fifty cent pieces in these days, that they would get *t*-1, they, the kids just don't seem *-2 to, to care that, that much about a small amount of money.	might	###speakera31.###but, uh, they weren't that successful,###so there were a lot of bottles 0 *t*-1 to be returned *-2###and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough * to buy whatever we wanted *t*-1 for the day###speakerb32.###uh-huh.###speakera33.###and,###speakerb34.###yeah,###and they, uh, p-,### i, i think 0 kids don't appreciate, maybe the value of money, that it's so little that they don't care,###they can get more somewhere else.###speakera35.###yeah,###just a little bit of begging will,###speakerb36.###uh, for a good,###right.###they're,
104497:40	so i would say 0 in the last three years, we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before.	probably	###speakerb34.###yeah,###and they, uh, p-,### i, i think 0 kids don't appreciate, maybe the value of money, that it's so little that they don't care,###they can get more somewhere else.###speakera35.###yeah,###just a little bit of begging will,###speakerb36.###uh, for a good,###right.###they're,###the nickels, the dimes or what, i suppose 0 it might be quarters, fifty cent pieces in these days, that they would get *t*-1, they, the kids just don't seem *-2 to, to care that, that much about a small amount of money.###speakera37.###right.###well, i wonder,###speakerb38.###but, we, we did buy a can crusher###and we are crushing cans###and when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety-nine cents *t*-1,
104511:63	since we've had the crusher all summer, we, i guess 0 we just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't ta-,	maybe	###right.###well, i wonder,###speakerb38.###but, we, we did buy a can crusher###and we are crushing cans###and when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety-nine cents *t*-1,###so i would say 0 in the last three years, we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before.###speakera39.###yeah.###speakerb40.###uh, it *exp*-1 was just easier *ich*-2 * to do that than * to open a large liter bottle and then have it go flat.###speakera41.###right,###yeah.###speakerb42.###so that's the main reason 0 we're, we, sort of are into cans *ich*-1 at this point rather than the liter bottles.###speakera43.###where do you take your cans *t*-1?###speakerb44.###well, as you say, it takes a while * to build it up.
104512:102	oh, i think 0 the kids, when we were on vacation *t*-1, they said 0 they did take them to a, a recycling place, probably at one of the li-,	probably	###well, i wonder,###speakerb38.###but, we, we did buy a can crusher###and we are crushing cans###and when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety-nine cents *t*-1,###so i would say 0 in the last three years, we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before.###speakera39.###yeah.###speakerb40.###uh, it *exp*-1 was just easier *ich*-2 * to do that than * to open a large liter bottle and then have it go flat.###speakera41.###right,###yeah.###speakerb42.###so that's the main reason 0 we're, we, sort of are into cans *ich*-1 at this point rather than the liter bottles.###speakera43.###where do you take your cans *t*-1?###speakerb44.###well, as you say, it takes a while * to build it up.###since we've had the crusher all summer, we, i guess 0 we just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't ta-,
104550:33	i find that, uh, about two years is probably my max on * subscribing to one in particular	probably	###speakera9.###speakerb10.###right.###speakera11.###and, uh, i read magazines mainly because they're fast and if i want *-1 to relax while i watch t v,###of course, i'm one of those that *t*-1 does two things at once,###and, uh, i read good housekeeping and better homes and mccall's.###and i like them because they're kind of short and to the subject.###speakerb12.###right.### i u-, i used *-1 to take mccall's and good housekeeping and, uh, several magazines like that a few years ago at, at, at home.###speakera13.###uh-huh.###and then you stopped them all.###speakerb14.###but, yeah,###the subscriptions ran out###and i never renewed them.###and i found that i really didn't have time *ich*-2 at home since i work, 0 * to read them *t*-1.###speakera15.
104581:30	and if something caught my eye, then i might read something,	might	###speakera21.###i don't get into books too often because i have so many things that i stay occupied with *t*-1 uh, on a general basis,###speakerb22.###uh-huh.###speakera23.###and we travel a lot###so i enjoy *-1 reading parts on travel in the various you know, different ones.###speakerb24.###uh-huh.###speakera25.###speakerb26.###right.###speakera27.###and i get into, uh, newspapers,###so i guess 0 that kind of tells you what kind of person i am *t*-1.###i'm, re-, read it fast and put it down.###speakerb28.###right.###uh-huh.### when, when i had my magazines at home *t*-1, i would find that i kind of skimmed through them and looked at the pictures, you know,
104624:38	i can see that it will be a very long time, probably, before i subscribe to any magazines at home.	probably	###speakerb38.###right.###speakera39.###but, uh, that's mainly my, uh, whole idea on you know, short subject, uh, reading and things like this.###speakerb40.###uh-huh.###speakera41.### i, i subscribe, like i said, to a few###and once in a while i buy that new magazine called * first *ich*-1 on the newsstands or something like that.###speakerb42.###uh-huh.###speakera43.###but i kind of stay with my own subject matter what, uh, *t*-1 pertains to my daily life at the present time.###speakerb44.###right.###speakera45.###speakerb46.###well, since i work with computers during my work, i have *-1 to keep up on all the new computer equipment and software and everything.###and i have *-1 to read the magazines, you know, such as byte, and computer world and mac world and all of these,, uh, magazines such as that,###so i really, you know, just,
104687:25	all right, i guess 0 we might as well end our conversation at this point.	might	###and i tried, uh, *-1 reading the magazines *-2 hoping 0 i would get more from it###and it was just above my head without * having someone *ich*-1 there 0 *t*-2 to give me the advice as i went along.###speakerb62.###uh-huh.###speakera63.###it was, you know, kind of a little bit more than what i needed *t*-1,###so i never did get into them.### i, when i bought the computer *t*-1, all of a sudden i was receiving them, for some unknown reason, through the mail.###i think 0 they all that-, thought, well, we have a live one.###she'll subscribe.###speakerb64.###uh-huh.###speakera65.###but they were wrong.###i never got into them.### but, but,###okay?###speakerb66.###right.###speakera67.
104738:78	well, i, i kind of, i thought, well, that, that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing.	might	###speakera3.###so, uh,###i mean, if it's true.### i, i've, i've always heard these things.###i've never bothered *-1 to dig it out and make * sure,###but, uh, i've heard it on more than one documentary that, uh, they were complaining that whoever *t*-1's sitting up there *-2 making these decisions or whatever institutions *t*-3 raise the money and, uh,###it's just one big p r campaign that,###yeah,###we think 0 that's the world's worst thing###so * let's give money to aids.###and yet we've had breast cancer problems for years.###speakerb4.###right.###speakera5.###and, it's just### one of those, uh, course, one of the shows 0 i saw *t*-1 was taking it from the angle that, since it doesn't effect men, it's not going *-2 to get funded *-3.###and, uh, * having thought about that for a while,###speakerb6.###what did you think *t*-1 about that idea?###speakera7.
104794:109	but, we have such an affluent a-, society, society that i wonder if, if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a, a cure for just about everything.	might	###and many of those things, uh, if they're not able *-1 to, to be insured *-2 then the country's going *-3 to pay for it one way or the other. whether it's through prevention or, or treatment or, you know, * just, uh, just helping the people when they are not able *-4 to take care of themselves *t*-5.###speakera15.###right.###speakerb16.###it seems like one way or the other we're going *-1 to end up *-2 paying for it.###speakera17.###that's true.###speakerb18.###but,###speakera19.###you know the, the other thought that i had *t*-1, uh,###i've had several minutes 0 * to think about this *t*-1 after i, uh,###while i was finding people, i, uh, i could think about the topic longer that the person that *t*-1 receives it,###so it's kind of a, a unfair advantage, as it were,###speakerb20.###speakera21.###but, the other thing that i thought of *t*-1 on this is, i wonder if there isn't enough money, uh, in our economy or in our system.###uh, it seems like there's so much that *t*-2 goes to things that *t*-1 don't really do a whole lot of good.###i mean, yeah,###they're kind of nice.
104814:8	they certainly do well for those who *t*-1 go to the symphony orchestra and all that,	certainly	###but, we have such an affluent a-, society, society that i wonder if, if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a, a cure for just about everything.###speakerb22.###* just change our p-,###speakera23.###of course, then we wouldn't have any room 0 * to put people *t*-1,###but that's,###speakerb24.###right,###* just change our priorities a little bit.###speakera25.###yeah.###speakerb26.###speakera27.###you know, you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza###or you hear these, these phenomenal amounts of dollars spent * for this, that or the other###and then you have all the arts that, that *t*-1 are nice and aesthetic,###but are they that enhancing for the, for the masses, you know.###speakerb28.###right.###speakera29.
104848:5	probably just for our own safety when we're traveling and things *t*-2 that would be something 0 i'd like *-1 to know that *t*-3's going on.	probably	###i don't work,###at home right now.###i stay home with my children.###uh, but my husband works###and they do have that at his place of employment###and neither of us have a problem with it.###we've,###particularly, like you said with the things that the airlines and, and such.### it's, uh, it *exp*-2's a scary thing * to know that, uh, you just don't know what people are doing *t*-1 uh, before they go to work.###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.###so, and the, the advertisements on television lately have been so, uh,###there have been so many. you know,###there's, uh###speakera5.###yeah.###speakerb6.###just about like train tr-, train wrecks and things like that, that###i feel like,
104953:45	because a lot of people, * seems like *t*-2, would probably obviously are trying *-1 to hide that uh, from their employer and friends and family and things	probably	###well, you, where you're located *-2 *t*-1, i, i do know 0 *t*-3 texas instruments has random drug testing.###speakerb34.###uh-huh.###speakera35.###and i think 0 they've had it for several years.###and their program 0 they had *t*-1, i don't think 0 *t*-2 had a lot of, uh, problems associated * with it,###but, uh, my brother-in-law happens *-1 to work there###and it, it sounded very positive.###and i, i think 0 it's great.### i, i would like, i would encourage it.###i'm pushing our company towards that.###mumblex.###speakerb36.###well, and, you know, if they do find someone who, who *t*-1 is, uh, having a problem with drugs and they can get them the help that they need *t*-1. as opposed to *-2 just letting the problem go on with, without any, uh, support. and whatever,###speakera37.###right.###speakerb38.###speakera39.###exactly.###speakerb40.
105045:13	and it was maybe fifteen, twenty acres	maybe	###and they took us out on the lake several times.###and, uh, i really did enjoy that.### i, i don't know that i ever learned *-1 to drive it or anything,###but, uh, we did some water skiing *ich*-1, of course, and, and, uh, * driving around the lake in the boat### and, and just the basic safety rules and things i found *t*-1 real interesting. uh, you know,### they, they just didn't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever.### the, the laws were there###and if you didn't obey them, uh you know, there were a lot of accidents, i guess.###speakera3.###right.###speakerb4.###speakera5.###that's true.###speakerb6.###but, uh, i found 0 the motor boating was real fun.###speakera7.###yeah,###i remember *-1 learning how * to ski *t*-2, oh,###i guess 0 i was seven or eight years old###and the lake that we learned on *t*-1 was the smaller of the two that we had access to *t*-2
105078:33	i'd kind of like, someday, *-1 to maybe end up on a pair of skis that, that *t*-2 doesn't have a, uh, well, what they call *t*-3 trick skis.	maybe	###it was just a little nibble###and so i told everybody what *t*-1 happened###and they go, oh, yeah, sure, you know.###speakerb10.###speakera11.###and so i get back down in there### and, and i'll be if he didn't do it again.###this time a little earlier### and, and i had let * go before then and, before they took off this time and, and swatted him away.###so i moved over a, a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living *t*-1 underneath the dock and, uh, managed *-2 to get up.###* didn't go very far,###but i got up.###and it, it was a nice, uh, nice long skiing career,###but now i've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me *t*-1.### i've, i've, uh, done about all 0 i dare *-1 do *t*-2 on skis.###you know, * skiing on one and jumping around here and there###and i, i, i know how you can get injured *-1 *-1 doing much more than that *t*-2###and i just can't risk it right now *-1 being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that.###* just, uh, can't take the risk 0 i did *t*-1 as a dumb teenager, i guess 0 *t*-2.###so life just changes a little bit in that respect.
105096:5	maybe someday i'll, i'll get back to that as, after the kids are up and grown and the monies *ich*-2 are there 0 * to get away for times on end, weekend or something *t*-1.	maybe	###* just, uh, can't take the risk 0 i did *t*-1 as a dumb teenager, i guess 0 *t*-2.###so life just changes a little bit in that respect.###i'd kind of like, someday, *-1 to maybe end up on a pair of skis that, that *t*-2 doesn't have a, uh, well, what they call *t*-3 trick skis.###they'll allow you to ski backwards.###i haven't cr-, managed *-1 to get a hold on that, uh, craft yet,###but, uh,###speakerb12.###that sounds like a real challenge.###speakera13.###yeah,### it, it would be kind of nice.###i hadn't quite figured out,###i don't have anybody 0 *t*-1 to teach me either.###that's another little thing.###you need somebody 0 *t*-1 to kind of tell you what * to do *t*-2,###but, just from what i've seen *t*-1, you just kind of work your way up to it and turn around real quick, you know. grab the rope behind you and then just let * go real quick and let it whip you around.###speakerb14.###uh-huh.###speakera15.###but, uh, i don't know,
105184:33	it, well, and that's probably,	probably	###but we used *-1 to have a lot of fun there.###speakera25.###well, you know, we went there once.###in fact, we had been in dallas###and we were on our way home###and we were driving###and we said * let's go to new orleans.###so when he said, well, this year, you know, i have a week there on a, a project *t*-1###he's going *-1 to be,###and then i said, well, i'll going along,###i hope 0 it's swimming season###because it wasn't a tremendous thing, amount of things 0 * to do *t*-2. that i wanted *-1 to do *t*-3 there.###speakerb26.###uh-huh.###speakera27.###speakerb28.###yeah,###if you don't like the night life and the antique shopping, there isn't much there,###but, that can be fun.###speakera29.
105207:44	uh, so, well, if you're working, then you're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go *t*-1.	probably	###speakerb30.###uh-huh.###speakera31.###and i'm kind of anxious for that,###but, uh, yours to disneyworld sounds a little bit better.###speakerb32.###speakera33.###did you know that next week there's several t v shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary.###speakerb34.###no,###i know 0 this is a real good time 0 * to go *t*-1, because they are having so many activities and special shows.###speakera35.###well, and with a daughter, nine, it is just,###she's old enough * to really grasp the meaning behind,###speakerb36.###yes.###speakera37.###speakerb38.###* be excited about all of it.###speakera39.
105261:63	i would have *-1 to say 0 we both end up *-2 going to las vegas, uh, probably once every maybe year and a half.	probably	###and i like *-1 to sight see###and i love *-1 to shop.###speakerb54.###uh-huh.###speakera55.###so it's,###speakerb56.###so that's perfect.###what more could you ask for *t*-1?###speakera57.###that's right,###but it,###speakerb58.###and then * got *-1 to pick and choose the places.###speakera59.###well, and one of my very favorite is las vegas.###speakerb60.###oh.###speakera61.###uh, that
105261:73	i would have *-1 to say 0 we both end up *-2 going to las vegas, uh, probably once every maybe year and a half.	maybe	###and i like *-1 to sight see###and i love *-1 to shop.###speakerb54.###uh-huh.###speakera55.###so it's,###speakerb56.###so that's perfect.###what more could you ask for *t*-1?###speakera57.###that's right,###but it,###speakerb58.###and then * got *-1 to pick and choose the places.###speakera59.###well, and one of my very favorite is las vegas.###speakerb60.###oh.###speakera61.###uh, that
105287:23	so we are thinking that we might go to las vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip.	might	###uh-huh.###speakera65.###and so i've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets###because we have a lot of flying with continental###speakerb66.###uh-huh.###speakera67.###and they're recommending that you use those because they don't know the future of continental.###speakerb68.###right,###it's kind of shaky.###speakera69.###and i said now that we have all the miles, we better start *-1 using them.###speakerb70.###that's true.###speakera71.###uh,###speakerb72.###it really is *?*.###speakera73.
105288:111	uh, when we normally go that way *t*-1, we like *-2 to go to california at the same time, because we really don't get out there as often as you could *?* probably from texas.	probably	###speakera65.###and so i've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets###because we have a lot of flying with continental###speakerb66.###uh-huh.###speakera67.###and they're recommending that you use those because they don't know the future of continental.###speakerb68.###right,###it's kind of shaky.###speakera69.###and i said now that we have all the miles, we better start *-1 using them.###speakerb70.###that's true.###speakera71.###uh,###speakerb72.###it really is *?*.###speakera73.###so we are thinking that we might go to las vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip.
105332:31	i would, i think probably not a, a brand new car,	probably	###and we went through the northern route and through utah and as far west as las vegas###speakerb82.###uh-huh.###speakera83.###and then we returned through, uh, new mexico that you just mentioned *t*-1.###speakerb84.###uh-huh.###speakera85.###and it was oh, it was just great.###speakerb86.###oh, there's too much 0 * to see *t*-1 really.###speakera87.###speakerb88.###speakera89.###oh, i, i think 0 that's, that's the way 0 * to,###speakera1.###all right,###why don't you go ahead first and tell what kind of car you'd look for *t*-1 in your next *t*-2.###speakerb2.###i think 0 our next car, i would like something like a, an economy car that *t*-1 gets really good mileage and, uh, one that *t*-2's really reliable.
105333:7	but maybe something like a nissan sentra. or something like that, uh,	maybe	###speakerb82.###uh-huh.###speakera83.###and then we returned through, uh, new mexico that you just mentioned *t*-1.###speakerb84.###uh-huh.###speakera85.###and it was oh, it was just great.###speakerb86.###oh, there's too much 0 * to see *t*-1 really.###speakera87.###speakerb88.###speakera89.###oh, i, i think 0 that's, that's the way 0 * to,###speakera1.###all right,###why don't you go ahead first and tell what kind of car you'd look for *t*-1 in your next *t*-2.###speakerb2.###i think 0 our next car, i would like something like a, an economy car that *t*-1 gets really good mileage and, uh, one that *t*-2's really reliable.### i would, i think probably not a, a brand new car,
105365:34	i think 0 that's something 0 we might want *t*-1, too, is some kind of standard transmission *ich*-2 at least rather than automatic.	might	###does it have *-1 to be a special color?.###speakerb8.###uh, i would think 0 kind of a subdued color would be nice.###speakera9.###speakerb10.###you know, a, a navy blue or a,###speakera11.###it sounds like something 0 your husband would drive *t*-1, right?.###speakerb12.###yeah,###that's what it would be for *t*-1 is for him to drive back and forth to work.###speakera13.###yes.###well, i don't think 0 we're looking for another car right now because we just bought one,###but when we were looking *t*-2 we were looking for something that *t*-1 had enough seat belts, of course,###and we wanted air-conditioning and a five speed###and that was kind of iffy,###but that made it better economically,###so,###speakerb14.
105370:11	we'll probably have *-1 to look for another second car sometime	probably	###you know, a, a navy blue or a,###speakera11.###it sounds like something 0 your husband would drive *t*-1, right?.###speakerb12.###yeah,###that's what it would be for *t*-1 is for him to drive back and forth to work.###speakera13.###yes.###well, i don't think 0 we're looking for another car right now because we just bought one,###but when we were looking *t*-2 we were looking for something that *t*-1 had enough seat belts, of course,###and we wanted air-conditioning and a five speed###and that was kind of iffy,###but that made it better economically,###so,###speakerb14.###i think 0 that's something 0 we might want *t*-1, too, is some kind of standard transmission *ich*-2 at least rather than automatic.###speakera15.###yeah.###speakerb16.###speakera17.
105372:22	s-, but probably real cheap, too.	probably	###it sounds like something 0 your husband would drive *t*-1, right?.###speakerb12.###yeah,###that's what it would be for *t*-1 is for him to drive back and forth to work.###speakera13.###yes.###well, i don't think 0 we're looking for another car right now because we just bought one,###but when we were looking *t*-2 we were looking for something that *t*-1 had enough seat belts, of course,###and we wanted air-conditioning and a five speed###and that was kind of iffy,###but that made it better economically,###so,###speakerb14.###i think 0 that's something 0 we might want *t*-1, too, is some kind of standard transmission *ich*-2 at least rather than automatic.###speakera15.###yeah.###speakerb16.###speakera17.###we'll probably have *-1 to look for another second car sometime###and we'd look for about what you're looking for *t*-1.
105382:25	prob-, well probably, probably that would be a good idea,	probably	###but that made it better economically,###so,###speakerb14.###i think 0 that's something 0 we might want *t*-1, too, is some kind of standard transmission *ich*-2 at least rather than automatic.###speakera15.###yeah.###speakerb16.###speakera17.###we'll probably have *-1 to look for another second car sometime###and we'd look for about what you're looking for *t*-1.### s-, but probably real cheap, too.###it wouldn't be a used, used car,### so, but, no.###speakerb18.###i think 0 we would want one that, even though it was a compact car or whatever that *t*-1 it would still be nice enough that, uh, you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed.###speakera19.###uh-huh.###would you like four doors###or * doesn't really matter.###speakerb20.
105382:36	prob-, well probably, probably that would be a good idea,	probably	###but that made it better economically,###so,###speakerb14.###i think 0 that's something 0 we might want *t*-1, too, is some kind of standard transmission *ich*-2 at least rather than automatic.###speakera15.###yeah.###speakerb16.###speakera17.###we'll probably have *-1 to look for another second car sometime###and we'd look for about what you're looking for *t*-1.### s-, but probably real cheap, too.###it wouldn't be a used, used car,### so, but, no.###speakerb18.###i think 0 we would want one that, even though it was a compact car or whatever that *t*-1 it would still be nice enough that, uh, you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed.###speakera19.###uh-huh.###would you like four doors###or * doesn't really matter.###speakerb20.
105418:35	but, uh, i feel that it's probably pre-, it's pretty good if, if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs.	probably	###i would go for that.###speakera27.###that would be great.###all right,###well, i think 0 that's all that we need *-1 to say *t*-2.###speakerb28.###well, * thank you for * calling.###speakera29.###all right,###we'll talk to you later.###speakerb30.###all right.###speakera31.###bye-bye.###speakerb32.###bye.###speakera1.###uh, i work at t i###and we have, uh, of course, started drug testing, uh, random drug testing here###and, uh, i haven't gotten called *-1 yet,
105444:64	and i think 0 just the idea that you know that you may be tested *-1 might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you're,	might	###speakerb4.###uh-huh.###speakera5.###speakerb6.###well, i, i think 0 it's a good idea just because i'm opposed to to the drugs.###speakera7.###uh-huh.###speakerb8.###i think 0 it can cause a lot of problems even though they think 0 they can handle it.###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###it's, uh,###i don't know,###i don't really liken it to alcohol###but, yet that can be carried *-1 to an extreme, too.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###so i think 0 it's a good idea
105454:35	is that how they do it at t i *t*-1 maybe.	maybe	###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###it's, uh,###i don't know,###i don't really liken it to alcohol###but, yet that can be carried *-1 to an extreme, too.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###so i think 0 it's a good idea###and i think 0 just the idea that you know that you may be tested *-1 might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you're,###speakera13.###right.###speakerb14.###i don't know that their job would be at risk,###because i think 0 they may put them into some sort of a program 0 *t*-1 to get them off of drugs.###speakera15.###right.###speakerb16.###i would think that,
105478:100	and it, it *exp*-1 is possible that, you know, that they can't do as good a job, uh, as they might do.	might	###i###at t i, if you get called *-1 in and you test positive for drugs, then you're put *-2 on a program###and, uh, you know, you go through the program###and then you're called *-1 like six months after you complete the pro-, program###speakerb18.###uh-huh.###speakera19.###and if you test positive, then you're terminated *-1.###speakerb20.###well,, i guess 0 i, i draw a hard line,###but, you know, i would, i'm, i'm in favor of, of that type of thing.###that, uh, you, you have people out there that *t*-1 are responsible for certain things###speakera21.###yeah,###uh-huh.###speakerb22.###speakera23.###uh-huh.###speakerb24.###and you expect them to do their job
105602:65	i just, i didn't think 0 it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period	probably	###speakera77.###it *exp*-1's very expensive * to run them.###and, uh, i didn't get a raise this year,###because, nobody in our company got a raise.###speakerb78.###uh-huh.###speakera79.###but, yet they spend all the money on drug testing###speakerb80.###just lucky * to have jobs.###speakera81.###and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing, people could have got a raise.###so, see, there, you know, there's different,### i don't think that that's, that, i think 0 that's more of a personal view of mine other than a, a yes, sir, we should have drug testing because there's really a problem###speakerb82.###uh-huh.###speakera83.###and i know that.###but then, i have other views to it.###speakerb84.
105626:8	theirs might not run a thousand dollars.	might	###and sam's and wal-mart are, are owned *-1 by the same people###speakera87.###uh-huh.###speakerb88.###he took one for, for, uh, wal-mart for job hiring###speakera89.###uh-huh.###speakerb90.###and then sam's called him### and, and he took another one###speakera91.###right.###speakerb92.###and i, you know, i don't know why they both made him do that *t*-1 since it was so close together.###speakera93.###uh-huh.###speakerb94.###i can see 0 if,###because, you know, if it's a thousand dollars, that's a thousand dollars 0 they wasted *t*-1.###speakera95.
105630:10	well, maybe they run,	maybe	###he took one for, for, uh, wal-mart for job hiring###speakera89.###uh-huh.###speakerb90.###and then sam's called him### and, and he took another one###speakera91.###right.###speakerb92.###and i, you know, i don't know why they both made him do that *t*-1 since it was so close together.###speakera93.###uh-huh.###speakerb94.###i can see 0 if,###because, you know, if it's a thousand dollars, that's a thousand dollars 0 they wasted *t*-1.###speakera95.###theirs might not run a thousand dollars.###our,###from what i understanding *t*-1 here at t i, they run close to a thousand dollars an employee.###speakerb96.
105634:7	or maybe it's under a health type program that *t*-1 it it, it would catch a lot of things.	maybe	###and then sam's called him### and, and he took another one###speakera91.###right.###speakerb92.###and i, you know, i don't know why they both made him do that *t*-1 since it was so close together.###speakera93.###uh-huh.###speakerb94.###i can see 0 if,###because, you know, if it's a thousand dollars, that's a thousand dollars 0 they wasted *t*-1.###speakera95.###theirs might not run a thousand dollars.###our,###from what i understanding *t*-1 here at t i, they run close to a thousand dollars an employee.###speakerb96.###well, maybe they run,###i don't know, you know,###that's just guessing it.###maybe they run a lot of other tests,
105755:32	and i'm about, uh, fifteen miles, probably, from downtown cleveland, something like that.	probably	###speakera31.###so, in my spare time, i love *-1 to sew.###there aren't too many people around *ich*-2 anymore that *t*-1 really enjoy sewing,###but i do make all my own clothes###and we recently purchased a new home,###so i enjoy *-1 doing my, uh, toppers for my window applications and things like that.###speakerb32.###oh, uh-huh.###speakera33.###but, uh, just when i thought 0 i really enjoyed my hobby *t*-1, yours sounds great.###speakerb34.###well, my sister is the seamstress of the two of us.### and, but she doesn't china paint###so we both have our expertise side.###speakera35.###that is excellent.###speakerb36.###what part of ohio are you in *t*-1?###speakera37.### we're in the sub-, i'm in the suburb of cleveland
105809:13	and you'll probably really, uh, re-, regain your enthusiasm for it once you get into a, a class again.	probably	###i had a friend from albany, which *t*-1 is about thirty-six miles away,###and we would meet every thursday morning at our instructor's home, because she did our firing for us,###and she would help us###and we bought lots of equipment from her, supplies###and it was just such a delightful time.###and then after i,###speakera49.###oh,###and it's so nice,###speakerb50.###* beg pardon?###speakera51.###it must be so nice for you, now that you're retired.###speakerb52.###i have been a little bit negligent about it because i was so tired when i had *-1 to go to work after my husband's death *t*-2.###so i have put it aside for a little while,###but i'm, i have just found me an instructor *-1 to get started again,###uh-huh.###speakera53.###oh, isn't that great.
106414:33	and, and then i'd have probably rolled it on.	probably	###speakera63.###yeah,###that would be really time, uh, a time saver.###speakerb64.###well, yeah,###if you just, you know###we didn't tape anything,###speakera65.###speakerb66.###we weren't that careful,###but it wasn't, you know,###i don't know,### it's, it's funny,###it's like, if you just go slow, you don't get, or at least i didn't get that many mistakes###speakera67.###uh-huh.###speakerb68.###i didn't make that many mistakes,###speakera69.###oh, me, i would have had *-1 to have taped the whole thing, and then brushed around the edges,
106422:24	well, the first time it'd probably would have taken me forever,	probably	###speakerb66.###we weren't that careful,###but it wasn't, you know,###i don't know,### it's, it's funny,###it's like, if you just go slow, you don't get, or at least i didn't get that many mistakes###speakera67.###uh-huh.###speakerb68.###i didn't make that many mistakes,###speakera69.###oh, me, i would have had *-1 to have taped the whole thing, and then brushed around the edges,### and, and then i'd have probably rolled it on.### i'd, it would have taken me forever.###speakerb70.###why?###just because you'd be afraid *-1 to do it,###or have you done it before.###speakera71.###yeah,
106455:46	so now i feel like if i ever buy a house, i can probably paint, if nothing else.	probably	###speakerb76.###well, a couple of week ends###we would go down two or three hours on the weekends,###speakera77.###uh-huh.###speakerb78.###and,###speakera79.###so there was two of you all?###speakerb80.###no,### there was, they were doing all sorts of repairs,###and there was, i was just painting because i don't know how * to do anything else *t*-1.###speakera81.###well, that's easy enough.###speakerb82.###so, there's a whole bunch of people.###speakera83.###um.###speakerb84.
106457:21	i think 0 i could probably do it uh,	probably	###we would go down two or three hours on the weekends,###speakera77.###uh-huh.###speakerb78.###and,###speakera79.###so there was two of you all?###speakerb80.###no,### there was, they were doing all sorts of repairs,###and there was, i was just painting because i don't know how * to do anything else *t*-1.###speakera81.###well, that's easy enough.###speakerb82.###so, there's a whole bunch of people.###speakera83.###um.###speakerb84.###so now i feel like if i ever buy a house, i can probably paint, if nothing else.###speakera85.
106617:70	and we intend *-1 to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years, or next year probably.	probably	###you have two cars the same,###speakerb44.###speakera45.###and i said, you know how when you have a bad one *t*-1, you say, never again *t*-2###speakerb46.###that's right.###speakera47.###i said, well, we had one,###and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it###speakerb48.###wow.###speakera49.###and it's an eighty-five,###and so i said, hey, this was a cinch,###we paid for the car,###and we still know now that we have this car 0 * to put all the miles on *t*-1.###speakerb50.###right.###speakera51.###this is for all the long running back and forth on, you know interstate driving and things,
106697:28	i, i couldn't probably be bothered *-1 *-1 doing that every month,	probably	###so you have one for entertainment and one for groceries et cetera.###and then for some reason * taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form, uh, causes you to realize how much *t*-1 is left *-2.###and she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope, what she's buying *t*-1.###speakerb12.###uh-huh.###speakera13.###and then at the end of the, of the period, pay period, if she has any left *-1, that much is for fun or entertainment.###speakerb14.###uh-huh.###speakera15.###and they kind of work it that way.###we tried for a while###and * a seems like the problem that they were having *t*-1 of all the, of all the things that *t*-3 worked was * not planning enough for the incidentals that we couldn't think about *t*-2.###speakerb16.###yes.###speakera17.###and those are the ones that *t*-1 will kill you.###you know, the accid-, the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that *t*-1 weren't supposed *-2 to be every month.###speakerb18.###well, yeah,
106749:91	and we're going *-1 to go ahead and try *-4 to just live on what we earn *t*-2 instead of *-5 guessing ahead of what we probably will have *t*-3 next month.	probably	###speakerb32.###no.###because if you charge things, uh, you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month, when you get paid *-1 *t*-2,###speakera33.###right.###speakerb34.###or you get paid *-1 the last day or next to the last day.###speakera35.###right.###speakerb36.###you pay all your bills###and there isn't anything left * 0 * to spend *t*-1 anyway.###speakera37.###well, that's true.###speakerb38.###speakera39.###what we're in the process of * doing *t*-1 right now is * paying off our credit cards entirely.###speakerb40.###uh-huh.###speakera41.
106761:27	uh, there was a time when maybe we didn't take all of them off *t*-1,	maybe	###speakera37.###well, that's true.###speakerb38.###speakera39.###what we're in the process of * doing *t*-1 right now is * paying off our credit cards entirely.###speakerb40.###uh-huh.###speakera41.###and we're going *-1 to go ahead and try *-4 to just live on what we earn *t*-2 instead of *-5 guessing ahead of what we probably will have *t*-3 next month.###speakerb42.###well, yeah,### we, we tried *-1 to, to, to,###speakera43.###oh.###speakerb44.###or we are paying them off now.###speakera45.###yeah,###we're not there yet.###speakerb46.
106788:34	but i can't see that it would work for probably the majority of people.	probably	###speakerb50.###speakera51.###that's right.###speakerb52.###speakera53.###that's right.###speakerb54.###and for most of, uh,###i mean i'm a substitute teacher,###and i've only substituted, i guess, for the last fifteen years,###speakera55.###huh.###speakerb56.###so there's only been really one working.###speakera57.###uh-huh,###same here.###uh-huh.###speakerb58.###and, uh, it, it works for me
106792:36	you ma-, you probably have a little extra than you have *-1 to have *?*, *-2 to,	probably	###speakera53.###that's right.###speakerb54.###and for most of, uh,###i mean i'm a substitute teacher,###and i've only substituted, i guess, for the last fifteen years,###speakera55.###huh.###speakerb56.###so there's only been really one working.###speakera57.###uh-huh,###same here.###uh-huh.###speakerb58.###and, uh, it, it works for me###but i can't see that it would work for probably the majority of people.###speakera59.###well, i could say 0 it's kind of,###you know, that's, that's good.
106857:19	and you enjoyed it better probably.	probably	###speakerb80.###so i started, *-1 working in nineteen eighty-seven and just saved, for three years.###speakera81.###how nice.###speakerb82.###speakera83.###uh-huh.###speakerb84.###but the,###what minuscule amount i made *t*-2###but, that way you just didn't put it on your credit card,###speakera85.###w-,###speakerb86.###speakera87.###well, that's,###speakerb88.### and, and it was paid for *-1.###speakera89.###and it made a big,
106877:21	i think 0 you're probably much ahead of me there	probably	###and you enjoyed it better probably.###speakerb90.###yes.###speakera91.###yeah, mumblex.###speakerb92.###and so i think that that's difficult for most people,###but then my father was, very scotch###speakera93.###i think so too.###speakerb94.###and, you know, you never could afford anything although we could afford everything if he wanted *-1 to *?*.###um,###speakera95.###so if you're out like in a department store and there's a sale, you're just real careful *-1 not to let your urges get hold of you?###speakerb96.###yes.###speakera97.### that's, that's excellent.###that's what i'm working toward *t*-1.
106993:82	and, uh, they're, they're actually going *-1 to extend it, i think, one of these days maybe to apartment complexes	maybe	###speakerb18.###yeah.###speakera19.###speakerb20.###huh.###speakera21.###and, uh, oh, i don't know,###i guess 0 they're, you know, clear bottles.###speakerb22.###yeah.###speakera23.###so, um, you know a lot of people do have those separated *-1.###and, of course, they have the, um, dumpsters, uh, the, the igloos.###speakerb24.###yeah.###speakera25.###uh, and they have those strateg-, strategically placed *-1 around the city.###speakerb26.###oh.###speakera27.
107084:13	and sometimes you might have two or three.	might	###wow, that's excellent.###speakera55.###yeah.###speakerb56.###that's good.###speakera57.###* let's see.###oh, and every year, of course, the phone books um, they tell everybody across the city *-1 to, uh, put all their phone books in, uh, the, uh, recycle bins.###speakerb58.###yeah.###speakera59.###speakerb60.###oh.###speakera61.###because, you know, phone books are pretty,###well, for a bigger city they're pretty thick.###speakerb62.###yeah,###they are *?*.###speakera63.
107264:10	well, maybe they didn't mention it because it's just kind of a fact of life around here.	maybe	###speakerb4.###oh, roaches and,###speakera5.###do they really?###speakerb6.###oh, yes.###cockroaches are awful here.###speakera7.###oh.###speakerb8.###just awful.###so i,###speakera9.###oh, and i know somebody that *t*-1 lives there,###and they never mentioned that problem.###speakerb10.###oh, you're kidding,###you're kidding.###no,###it's a d-,
107268:8	they probably just take it for granted then.	probably	###speakerb6.###oh, yes.###cockroaches are awful here.###speakera7.###oh.###speakerb8.###just awful.###so i,###speakera9.###oh, and i know somebody that *t*-1 lives there,###and they never mentioned that problem.###speakerb10.###oh, you're kidding,###you're kidding.###no,###it's a d-,###well, maybe they didn't mention it because it's just kind of a fact of life around here.###and, uh,###speakera11.###oh, my.
107341:23	and i think 0 we'll probably experience some of your weather although i think 0 they have more humidity.	probably	###so it's kind of nice.###i don't know how yours has been *t*-1.###speakerb34.###well, it's been real hot here lately.###i mean we've had *-1 to actually have the air-conditioning on and everything###but, uh, doe-,###it's supposed *-1 to rain again now, uh, this weekend.###speakera35.###oh, i see.###speakerb36.###so, then,###speakera37.###okay.###well, we're leaving tomorrow###and we're going down to new orleans###and from ohio since we're right near lake erie###this is going *-1 to be a switch for us for a week * going down there,###speakerb38.###yeah.###speakera39.
107368:42	but, uh, and with children, um, you probably don't have time *ich*-2 anyhow 0 * to, to get into it *t*-1.	probably	### i, well, not here.###i mean it's just,###here i just can't stand *-1 to even get out in the, uh, in the dirt.###just,###speakera43.###well, how about when you were in colorado *t*-1?###speakerb44.###well, i liked it a little bit###but i didn't, uh,###i was working at that time full-time and didn't have a lot of time, for that###speakera45.###uh-huh.###speakerb46.###and so that i think 0 *t*-1 really, um, hampered it a little bit.###speakera47.###well, and then, too, now like where we had the dry summer and we had *-2 to sprinkle constantly *t*-1. my water bill was high.###and, uh, if you have that on a regular basis in texas, i think 0 i would go with something very dry *-1 to keep it off, you know.###speakerb48.###yeah.###speakera49.
107439:38	and i have often wondered if, if maybe that would help the situation.	maybe	###do you think 0 this is vital important?###speakerb6.###oh, absolutely.###speakera7.###okay.###do you,###speakerb8.###um, i think that, uh, it's kind of discouraging to, uh,###i have been involved in some political campaigns and that kind of thing,###and it *exp*-1's really discouraging * to be in a phone bank and call people and not,###a lot of them are so ill informed###they have no idea, you know, even that there's an election### or, and these are people that *t*-1 are registered.###speakera9.### i, it, i have worked in some campaigns###speakerb10.###speakera11.###and it's the most discouraging thing in the world.###i'm originally from oklahoma,###and up there if they miss three elections, then they have *-1 to reregister.
107444:36	well, can you come up with anything else that maybe we could do *t*-1 to these people?	maybe	###do you,###speakerb8.###um, i think that, uh, it's kind of discouraging to, uh,###i have been involved in some political campaigns and that kind of thing,###and it *exp*-1's really discouraging * to be in a phone bank and call people and not,###a lot of them are so ill informed###they have no idea, you know, even that there's an election### or, and these are people that *t*-1 are registered.###speakera9.### i, it, i have worked in some campaigns###speakerb10.###speakera11.###and it's the most discouraging thing in the world.###i'm originally from oklahoma,###and up there if they miss three elections, then they have *-1 to reregister.###and i have often wondered if, if maybe that would help the situation.###i don't know.###speakerb12.###well, that's a thought.###speakera13.
107454:54	um, one thing that i-, that i think probably one of the reasons that people don't vote more *t*-1 is because they don't know the candidates.	probably	###speakerb10.###speakera11.###and it's the most discouraging thing in the world.###i'm originally from oklahoma,###and up there if they miss three elections, then they have *-1 to reregister.###and i have often wondered if, if maybe that would help the situation.###i don't know.###speakerb12.###well, that's a thought.###speakera13.###well, can you come up with anything else that maybe we could do *t*-1 to these people?###speakerb14.###huh.###i don't know### i, i like that idea.###um, oh, i had a thought just a second ago###but it slipped my mind.###speakera15.###oh, that's all right.###speakerb16.
107521:133	and sometimes it *exp*-1's nice * to be able * to go ahead of time and vote because, you know, if you're going *-2 to be tied up that day, uh, * campaigning or whatever it might be. um, 0 that kind of, just kind of takes that load off, you know,	might	###no excuse.###uh, i'm not sure if i'm familiar with that, or not.###speakera33.###okay.###speakerb34.###speakera35.###i'm sure 0 all over the state of texas now you have three weeks 0 * to go for absentee balloting *t*-1.###speakerb36.###uh-huh.###speakera37.###and you don't have *-1 to h-, be sick, out of town or anything.### they, there is no excuse.###anyone can go and vote.###speakerb38.###oh, i think 0 that's great.###um,###speakera39.###do you?###speakerb40.###actually, you know, my husband has run for office before
107669:7	and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever *t*-1, i don't know what they're going *-2 to do *t*-3.	maybe	###speakerb28.###when he retired *t*-1?###speakera29.###yeah,###and he's got, you know, seven brothers and sisters### and, and, uh, he's the one because he's the one that * isn't going to work every day and that she moved in with *t*-2 when she needed *-3 to move in with someone *t*-4.###and,###speakerb30.###yeah,###it's like that good for us just because my uncle and my, and my mom switch off like we have her for three months and then he has her for three months.###speakera31.###oh, well, that's great.###speakerb32.###so that, that works out good.###speakera33.###that's a good idea.###we ought *-1 to,###speakerb34.###speakera35.###yeah,
107678:45	so if my parents do need *-1 to live with someone, it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers *ich*-3 around and everything 0 * to care for *t*-2. you know,	probably	###it's like that good for us just because my uncle and my, and my mom switch off like we have her for three months and then he has her for three months.###speakera31.###oh, well, that's great.###speakerb32.###so that, that works out good.###speakera33.###that's a good idea.###we ought *-1 to,###speakerb34.###speakera35.###yeah,###and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever *t*-1, i don't know what they're going *-2 to do *t*-3.###it's really not my family.###it's my fiancee's###so i don't, i can't say much.###speakerb36.###uh-huh.###speakera37.###but i always feel like i would never put my parents in either###and i wonder, i'm going *-1 to be the only sibling that *t*-2 isn't going *-3 to have children
107733:7	and maybe they should *?*, you know because we're all going *-1 to get old someday.	maybe	###speakera51.###and they, oh, the old-timer made with the old way###and nobody respects the traditions.###and, you know, it's###i, i'm not saying that i do either###but you know, it's just funny###speakerb52.###right.###speakera53.### and, and we really don't have any that *t*-1 don't have the social security and everything###* really isn't that much for elderly people 0 * to live on *t*-1.###speakerb54.###uh-huh.###speakera55.###you know, even if they're in good health it's incredible.###speakerb56.###right.###speakera57.###they don't have any,###they don't get special treatment
107909:11	so you probably have a job 0 you need *-1 to get to *t*-2 pretty soon.	probably	###i think so.###speakera53.### it was, it *exp*-1 was good * talking to you.###speakerb54.###it *exp*-1 was nice * talking with you.###speakera55.###maybe we'll get the next time.###speakerb56.###okay.###speakera57.###* take care.###speakerb58.###okay.###speakera59.###bye-bye.###speakerb60.###bye.###speakera1.###okay,###why don't you start *t*-1
107943:51	so, i'm going *-1 to be dressing just in casual slacks and t-shirts, probably not blue jeans, but little bit short of that, just, just tennis shoes and play clothes.	probably	###speakerb8.###the, um, thing that, that *t*-1 distinguishes me a lot of the time when i have *-2 to dress real professionally for a meeting or something *t*-3 is 0 i wear a clerical collar and a suit and, uh, all of that sort of thing,###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###but when i don't need *-1 to dress up for a, a meeting or a service of some sort *t*-2, i don't.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###speakera13.###so you're in a church there?###speakerb14.###yes.###speakera15.###uh-huh.###well, i'm working, this is my first morning 0 * to work down at our little church preschool *t*-1,###and they've told me *-1 to wear just something terribly comfortable because these are two year olds,###and they have a lot of, uh, they have bible lessons###and they have all the things during the morning,###but they still have snack time and play time,
107945:22	well, around there you can probably wear, uh, t-shirts and other things,	probably	###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###but when i don't need *-1 to dress up for a, a meeting or a service of some sort *t*-2, i don't.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###speakera13.###so you're in a church there?###speakerb14.###yes.###speakera15.###uh-huh.###well, i'm working, this is my first morning 0 * to work down at our little church preschool *t*-1,###and they've told me *-1 to wear just something terribly comfortable because these are two year olds,###and they have a lot of, uh, they have bible lessons###and they have all the things during the morning,###but they still have snack time and play time,###so, i'm going *-1 to be dressing just in casual slacks and t-shirts, probably not blue jeans, but little bit short of that, just, just tennis shoes and play clothes.###speakerb16.
108040:21	and she would not have even probably owned a pair of tennis shoes after she got out of high school,	probably	###speakera47.###well, i think 0 that's, i think 0 that's great.###i think 0 that's good.###speakerb48.###it's taken a long time * to break away, from, from that###speakera49.###speakerb50.###speakera51.###i understand.###speakerb52.###but now that i've broken away from it, i'm, i'm glad 0 i have *?*.###speakera53.###well, another interesting thing on the our, our end here is how, even in my forties, how much younger *ich*-2 i dress *t*-1 than my mother would have *?* in her forties,###and i will run around to the store in things, in slacks and tennis shoes,###and she,###speakerb54.###you mean 0 you don't need *-1 to wear little old house dresses any more?###speakera55.###right,###and pearls,
108163:47	i mean, if you want *-1 to go all time favorite show, probably one of them was little house on the prairie	probably	### i, i guess 0 that is supposed *-1 to be put *-2 out at a time when i was growing up or whatever *t*-3.###i guess 0 i can really relate to it,###and, uh, it's just a real cute show.###uh, i, i guess 0 i like the shows that *t*-1 really have a real sense of, uh, i don't know, honesty or sort of a purity value, i guess 0 *t*-2.###speakerb16.###i do, too.### i, i don't like it,###uh, lot of the shows that, that i've liked *t*-1 in the past, like, uh, oh, golden girls and, some of them tend *-1 to get so risque,###and when you have children uh, watching it *t*-2, that sometimes really starts *-1 to bother me###speakera17.###uh-huh.###speakerb18.###speakera19.###yeah,###speakerb20.###speakera21.###right,###right.###speakerb22.###and, uh, that's one of the reasons,
108228:10	uh, probably the pirates,	probably	###speakera39.###yeah,###uh-huh.###speakerb40.###um, i, i enjoy those also, almost as, as much to a certain extent.###i'm,###our whole house is baseball fans###speakera41.###uh-huh.###speakerb42.###and, uh, we enjoy that,###and, uh###speakera43.###so you're going *-1 to watch a game tonight?###speakerb44.###oh yeah,###oh, yeah.###speakera45.###so do you, do you have a favorite for the series or anything?###speakerb46.
108276:5	maybe they'll make it,	maybe	### i, i like steve bushel,###but i don't really like the pirates.###i'm a big saint louis cardinals fan###speakerb58.###uh-huh.###speakera59.###so, uh, i'm kind of, i'm kind of pulling for the braves over all,### they, you know, they they've come from so far down,###speakerb60.###uh-huh.###speakera61.###i really would like *-1 to see them do well.###speakerb62.###well, yeah,###yeah,###it's, uh,###so i keep *-2 hoping 0 the rangers are going *-1 to do.###speakera63.###yeah,### one, one year they,
108313:71	like the wonder years, i, i mean, it's kind of risque stuff for, maybe for teenagers,	maybe	###speakerb68.###well, it's,###so many of them now, um, you know, it just seems like they feel like they have *-1 to stick that stuff in,### and and, uh, you know, i'm, you know, i'm, i'm an adult###speakera69.###yeah.###speakerb70.###speakera71.###yeah.###speakerb72.###and i have adult tastes now,###but i don't need that###speakera73.###yeah,###yeah.###speakerb74.###uh, i, i like things that, uh, *t*-1 are, are wholesome, i guess.###speakera75.###yeah,###well that, that seems *-1 to be more our values, too,
108484:57	you can't understand what they're saying *t*-1 on some of those songs which *t*-2 probably is just as well on some of them, too.	probably	###speakera49.###and so the, the musicians don't get *-1 to really get into their music.###they just play a certain number of chords###speakerb50.###yeah.###speakera51.###the drummer plays a certain beat,###and you have a country and western song###speakerb52.###um.###speakera53.###and,###speakerb54.###well, that's kind of the way 0 i feel *t*-1 about rock and roll sometimes, too, i guess 0 *t*-2.###they don't really,###* has kind of the same sound over and over,###and the other thing 0 i don't like *t*-1 about it is 0 they have a tendency * to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are *t*-2###speakera55.###um. right.###speakerb56.
108493:27	but i, i definitely, i really enjoy the fifties *rnr*-2, the sixties *rnr*-2 and a lot, some of the seventies *rnr*-2 rock and roll	definitely	###um.###speakera53.###and,###speakerb54.###well, that's kind of the way 0 i feel *t*-1 about rock and roll sometimes, too, i guess 0 *t*-2.###they don't really,###* has kind of the same sound over and over,###and the other thing 0 i don't like *t*-1 about it is 0 they have a tendency * to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are *t*-2###speakera55.###um. right.###speakerb56.###you can't understand what they're saying *t*-1 on some of those songs which *t*-2 probably is just as well on some of them, too.###speakera57.###speakerb58.###speakera59.###yeah.###and i can't say that i like a lot of the modern, the very, very modern, uh, rock and roll,###speakerb60.###yeah.###speakera61.
108505:32	you know if it's informal i'd probably choose something, i mean, just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill because that's a lot of fun, especially this time of year where it's so nice out *t*-1.	probably	###speakera57.###speakerb58.###speakera59.###yeah.###and i can't say that i like a lot of the modern, the very, very modern, uh, rock and roll,###speakerb60.###yeah.###speakera61.###but i, i definitely, i really enjoy the fifties *rnr*-2, the sixties *rnr*-2 and a lot, some of the seventies *rnr*-2 rock and roll###speakerb62.###yeah###speakera63.###speakerb64.###earlier things.###speakera65.###and, uh, i really enjoy, especially the sixties...###speakera1.###okay,###while i was waiting for you to connect, i, i thought of a couple of menus,###so i decided 0 it had *-1 to be in it, *-1 informal or not.

108688:10	well, maybe a little more leisure time 0 * to do it *t*-1.	maybe	###speakerb70.###marinated in olive oil and some seasoning, um, and cooked with some olives and some, and some prunes, uh,###there's a little bit of brown sugar in there,###and it bakes up###and it's a delicious thing,###and it's easy###speakera71.###that sounds good.###speakerb72.###comparatively.###so. um. i'm sorry,###speakera73.###that sounds really good.###speakerb74.###i just love,###speakera75.###it sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than i am *?*,###i'm pretty simple right now,###but.###speakerb76.
108694:16	that's probably, that's true,	probably	###speakera71.###that sounds good.###speakerb72.###comparatively.###so. um. i'm sorry,###speakera73.###that sounds really good.###speakerb74.###i just love,###speakera75.###it sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than i am *?*,###i'm pretty simple right now,###but.###speakerb76.###well, maybe a little more leisure time 0 * to do it *t*-1.###speakera77.###yes###speakerb78.###i don't know,###speakera79.
108731:16	talk to you later maybe.	maybe	###and so it *exp*-1 was easy * to open a can of ravioli.###speakera87.###speakerb88.###speakera89.###yeah.###speakerb90.###speakera91.###spaghetti's a pretty staple every other week or so###speakerb92.###yes.###speakera93.###and it goes a long ways too.###so.###all righty.###speakerb94.###well, nice * talking to you cheryl.###speakera95.###speakerb96.###okay.###speakera97.
108829:43	so i think 0 that would be one thing 0 i would definitely consider *t*-1 * try *-6 to find a school within the state that, um, i liked *t*-3 well enough *-2 to attend.	definitely	###speakera35.###yeah,###because, um, she was pay-,###of course back then it was so much cheaper than it is *?* now.###it was like four dollars a semester hour###speakerb36.###uh-huh.###speakera37.###and so i was going to school for, you know, just a few hundred dollars a semester,###and she was paying forty dollars an hour###speakerb38.###golly,###speakera39.###so she paid ten times as much because she was out of state.###speakerb40.###yeah,###luckily i've paid in state tuition the whole time.###speakera41.###oh, that's good.###yeah,
108843:42	so depending on what your major is *t*-1, or medical, you might want *-2 to atteck-, some, um, attend somewhere like tech	might	###speakerb40.###yeah,###luckily i've paid in state tuition the whole time.###speakera41.###oh, that's good.###yeah,###so i think 0 that would be one thing 0 i would definitely consider *t*-1 * try *-6 to find a school within the state that, um, i liked *t*-3 well enough *-2 to attend.###speakerb42.###uh-huh, um,###speakera43.###speakerb44.###uh-huh.###the second thing is 0 some colleges only offer the, uh, liberal arts and, uh, whereas like state, they offer engineering courses###speakera45.###uh-huh.###speakerb46.###speakera47.###right,###yeah.###speakerb48.
108932:26	and, uh, something that *t*-1 might play a part is the size of the college.	might	###yeah,###this was great,###it was just based *-1 on, you know, how much your tuition costs *t*-2 and everything,###and generally it paid everything,###so i went to school about three years of my four for almost nothing,###speakerb76.###uh-huh.###speakera77.###so that was,###speakerb78.###golly, that's great.###speakera79.###yeah,###it was really nice.###speakerb80.###oh, another thing.### i've got a, i've got a degree from another college###speakera81.###uh-huh.###speakerb82.
108974:37	but i guess 0 some of the other smaller colleges might, might be a lot different.	might	###speakerb94.###and, uh, you don't get near the, uh, quality of education,###and as well, the, uh, smaller schools often times don't cost as much.###speakera95.###um, i didn't know that.###speakerb96.###oh, yeah.###speakera97.###um. well, i guess 0 the only comparison 0 i had ever heard *t*-1 was between a, a christian college, because i thought about *-2 attending abilene christian instead of texas tech###speakerb98.###uh-huh.###speakera99.###speakerb100.###uh-huh.###speakera101.###and of course the price was just astronomical compared to tech###speakerb102.###um.###speakera103.###the christian college was so much more expensive.
108974:45	but i guess 0 some of the other smaller colleges might, might be a lot different.	might	###speakerb94.###and, uh, you don't get near the, uh, quality of education,###and as well, the, uh, smaller schools often times don't cost as much.###speakera95.###um, i didn't know that.###speakerb96.###oh, yeah.###speakera97.###um. well, i guess 0 the only comparison 0 i had ever heard *t*-1 was between a, a christian college, because i thought about *-2 attending abilene christian instead of texas tech###speakerb98.###uh-huh.###speakera99.###speakerb100.###uh-huh.###speakera101.###and of course the price was just astronomical compared to tech###speakerb102.###um.###speakera103.###the christian college was so much more expensive.
108985:13	and i would definitely get my money's worth,	definitely	###speakera99.###speakerb100.###uh-huh.###speakera101.###and of course the price was just astronomical compared to tech###speakerb102.###um.###speakera103.###the christian college was so much more expensive.###but i guess 0 some of the other smaller colleges might, might be a lot different.###speakerb104.###um. oh, i, at state, i think 0 *t*-2 it *exp*-1's just a waste of somebody's money * to go there###speakera105.###really?###speakerb106.###it's really a shame because of, you know, the instruction###speakera107.###yeah.###speakerb108.###um, i'd rather *-1 go to any other college, you know, in the state,
109234:18	we've been here probably two and a half years,	probably	###well, we've been here since january,###so we, we still feel very new,###speakera7.###well,###speakerb8.###but, uh it's working up to a year now,###speakera9.###yeah.###speakerb10.###so, i guess 0 we're old timers compared to some people.###speakera11.###yeah,###i think 0 that's a good excuse.###you need *-1 to get into the the system a little more and know where * to take things *t*-2.###speakerb12.###right.###speakera13.###speakerb14.###yeah.###speakera15.
109343:66	oh, when we first were, were here *t*-1, it was like we'd take maybe a, oh, a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full,	maybe	###it was real easy with the bins,###it really was *?*,###it was just no effort *ich*-1 at all, um, no more trouble than * taking out the garbage,###so, um,###speakera51.###yeah.###i've gotten used to *-1 washing the, you know, the, um, salad dressing bottles and things like that,###speakerb52.###right.###speakera53.###it's not that big of a deal,###and it *exp*-1's nicer * to just throw them out,###but we can do our part take an extra minute or two.###speakerb54.###yeah.###speakera55.###speakerb56.###well, how much do you earn *t*-1 on the cans,### i, i didn't know ho-, what kind of an idea * to give her *t*-1 for,###speakera57.
109343:103	oh, when we first were, were here *t*-1, it was like we'd take maybe a, oh, a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full,	maybe	###it was real easy with the bins,###it really was *?*,###it was just no effort *ich*-1 at all, um, no more trouble than * taking out the garbage,###so, um,###speakera51.###yeah.###i've gotten used to *-1 washing the, you know, the, um, salad dressing bottles and things like that,###speakerb52.###right.###speakera53.###it's not that big of a deal,###and it *exp*-1's nicer * to just throw them out,###but we can do our part take an extra minute or two.###speakerb54.###yeah.###speakera55.###speakerb56.###well, how much do you earn *t*-1 on the cans,### i, i didn't know ho-, what kind of an idea * to give her *t*-1 for,###speakera57.
109397:21	but, may, maybe they'll beat me and, and do the city wide first.	maybe	###so.###speakerb74.###well, that sounds like a pretty good project.###speakera75.###well, the boys think 0 it's fun,###plus you get your exercise###and, you do get *-1 to stop once in a while when there is a can *t*-2 *-3 to rest,###speakerb76.###speakera77.###speakerb78.###speakera79.###so###speakerb80.###oh.###speakera81.###but.###speakerb82.###well, i'll have *-1 to keep myself and, and ge-, get on it.###my neighbor across the street, um, is so careful about recycling,###and so i keep *-1 telling myself, 0 i'll, i'll get it organized,
109435:7	and maybe we'll get on line again.	maybe	###but, well, um, have you,###speakera89.###so.###speakerb90.###do they time this thing for us,###or do we *?*,###speakera91.###um, yeah,###you can do it as long as you want *?*.###they, you know,###if it's been long enough,###five minutes is, is when they cut in and say, say, we don't have any more room for recording *t*-1.###speakerb92.###you can't chat all day, huh.###speakera93.###so we can say good-bye now.###speakerb94.###okay.###speakera95.###it *exp*-1 was good * talking to you,
109717:27	it was redone *-1 at the time probably when earth tones were in *t*-2	probably	###speakerb118.###uh-huh###speakera119.###yeah###speakerb120.###so.###speakera121.###well, our house was redo-, uh,###our house is very old also###speakerb122.###uh-huh.###speakera123.###it's like thirty-seven years old###speakerb124.###wow.###speakera125.###yeah,###and it was redone *-1 before we moved in, which,###i'm thankful for that,###but the,
109797:26	but it does sound like it's definitely growing.	definitely	###speakerb152.###and that's just like a mile or two from our house###speakera153.###oh, well, that's nice.###speakerb154.###but, when we first moved to coppell, it's what *rnr*-1, six years ago *t*-2, we didn't even have a grocery store###speakera155.###oh, wow,###speakerb156.###and now we have four###speakera157.###oh.###speakerb158.###and coppell's not really big enough * to support fo-, four grocery stores###speakera159.###yeah,###yeah###speakerb160.###so,###speakera161.
109825:41	we, at the time we thought 0 we might buy a mobile home,	might	###speakera165.###oh, uh-huh.###speakerb166.###speakera167.###uh-huh.###speakerb168.###and coppell's now about the size that lewisville was *t*-1 when, when i moved down here *t*-2.###speakera169.###oh, i see.###speakerb170.###speakera171.###well, when we first moved here *t*-1, we moved here from lubbock###speakerb172.###uh-huh.###speakera173.###and we almost moved to lewisville,###that was our second choice, yeah, behind garland,###speakerb174.###oh really,###speakera175.
109882:37	but i guess 0 more than anything i think 0 maybe people were just kind of wanting *-1 to have the choice of what they could do *t*-2, you know	maybe	###okay,###speakera17.###okay,###* hold on.###okay,###well i guess 0 we're supposed *-1 to talk about the changing roles of women.###speakerb18.###yeah.###speakera19.###* seems like, um, to me, everything is just changing so much that it's almost like, um, you can't keep up with things any more,###and everything is, uh, ther-, everyone's striving so much * to make it equal between men and women,###i personally, i'm a stay home mom,###and i like it the way 0 it used *-1 to be *t*-2.###speakerb20.###so am *t*-1 i.###speakera21.###are you *?*,###speakerb22.###you know, i think 0 it's kind of coming back around to that, don't you,###i mean, that there's a lot more people *ich*-2 that *t*-1 stay home now than before,
109985:25	i can see where that would definitely hinder the problem *t*-1,	definitely	###that###men don't treat you like you don't know anything, * generally speaking.###speakerb48.###yeah.###speakera49.###speakerb50.###well, and i think 0 a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as like job sharing or, you know, even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff,###and i think 0 that's really important that, that they do that###speakera51.###yeah.###speakerb52.###and they realize 0 there's a need for that,###and, um, i don't know,###i found 0 when i did do some work *t*-1 when my son was young *t*-2, it was like contract work,###and it wasn't where i had *-1 to be there every day *t*-2,###but, i mean, we were going to the doctor once a week,###so, i don't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time 0 * to do anything besides * go to the doctor *t*-1 *t*-2.###speakera53.###yeah,###yeah,
109986:4	definitely.	definitely	###men don't treat you like you don't know anything, * generally speaking.###speakerb48.###yeah.###speakera49.###speakerb50.###well, and i think 0 a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as like job sharing or, you know, even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff,###and i think 0 that's really important that, that they do that###speakera51.###yeah.###speakerb52.###and they realize 0 there's a need for that,###and, um, i don't know,###i found 0 when i did do some work *t*-1 when my son was young *t*-2, it was like contract work,###and it wasn't where i had *-1 to be there every day *t*-2,###but, i mean, we were going to the doctor once a week,###so, i don't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time 0 * to do anything besides * go to the doctor *t*-1 *t*-2.###speakera53.###yeah,###yeah,###i can see where that would definitely hinder the problem *t*-1,
110042:17	and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds	probably	###um, our friends in houston bred the dogs.###i had never heard of them###speakerb16.###no,###i haven't *?* either.###speakera17.### they're, um, they're all white###and they're small, and, um, and fluffy,###they don't shed.###i guess 0 they're distantly related to a poodle,###but they're not very well known *-1 in this country,###and they're not, um, high strung or over bred um.###speakerb18.###oh.###speakera19.###speakerb20.###and how big do they get *t*-1.###speakera21.###ours is, uh, on the small end,###and she's about ten pounds,
110080:35	we've, uh, we thought probably 0 our neighborhood in houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of, um, the family that *t*-1 had them and, and bred them.	probably	###so, uh, we ended up *-1 getting this,###and, uh, my son would rather have a golden retriever, though, i think 0 *t*-1###speakerb28.###oh.###speakera29.###now he wants a, a good size dog.###speakerb30.###uh-huh,###well, we've got a good size dog,###and we were considering *-2 getting a puppy, a small house, lap top dog for him, because he likes other animals and for me, because we used *-1 to have a miniature dachshund,###and i miss *-1 having a little one you know, around.###speakera31.###oh.###speakerb32.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###the kind 0 you have *t*-1 sounds very interesting, though.###speakera35.###well, they really are, um, they're really sweet dogs.
110208:15	um, but she might have some contacts here,	might	###oh, yes.###speakera81.###speakerb82.###just pets,###speakera83.###speakerb84.###yes,###that's what we'd rather have *t*-1 is just a pet, instead of###speakera85.###ri-,###speakerb86.###we used *-1 to show saint bernards when i was a little girl *t*-2.###we did that every weekend,###speakera87.###oh, but, yeah, * takes a lot of time.###speakerb88.###yes,###and it's very expensive.###speakera89.###yeah,
110258:111	but *-1 not being a teacher, as you are *?*, you know, i, i was not quite as sympathetic as, you know, as i probably would have been *?* if, if kay were a teacher or something.	probably	###well, i don't believe in drugs or alcohol,###but if you'll remember when the teachers had *-1 to take the t cat *t*-3 they were talking about *-2 drug testing us###speakera9.###right.###speakerb10.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###and we were laughing that we'd have *-1 to go to that examination *-1 to prove 0 we could read and write with a specimen of urine###speakera13.###uh-huh.###speakerb14.###and we found it belittling.###speakera15.###you did?###speakerb16.###yeah,###speakera17.###uh-huh.###well, i can sort of understand that, uh,
110289:51	you know, in those areas i really, you know, do believe that maybe we should clean up our, you know house.	maybe	###speakera23.###uh-huh.###speakerb24.###speakera25.###that's right.###speakerb26.###speakera27.###that's right.###speakerb28.###it's supposed *-1 to be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs and alcohol,###speakera29.###uh, that's right###speakerb30.###speakera31.###and i think 0 it is a big problem with them using drugs from what you read *t*-1, you know,###speakerb32.###and,###speakera33.###but, uh,###speakerb34.
110316:11	i'd probably feel the same way if i had *-2 to do that.	probably	###uh, i know kay's company, you know,###they started it couple of years ago,###and so many of the people, even the professional people were, boy, they were so against them doing that, you know,###and i thought, jeez, to me it's quite simple,###uh, you either need a job###or you don't.### the, the job is what *t*-1 provides all of your needs,###and, uh, if they say, hey, you can't do this work, i'd say, hey, i agree,### i don't, i won't do that.###and i think 0 most of them have agreed to that now, although they didn't like it at first.###speakerb38.###yeah,###i think 0 it's just like anything else, a new concept, you know,###as i said, if i have *-1 to go to a testing area with my urine specimen i was insulted *-2,###speakera39.###yeah,###it is *?*,###i can see where you would think,###yeah,###that is belittling, you know,
110422:87	then, i think, you know, 0 if if it came, push came to shove, i'd probably be drug tested *-1 you know,	probably	###speakera79.###speakerb80.###yeah,###well, did you hear on the news where the teacher of the year was up for child molestation *t*-1.###speakera81.### isn't that, isn't that mind boggling,###speakerb82.###speakera83.###speakerb84.###it was on the news tonight.###speakera85.###goodness,### it, it is, it's mind bog-, you know, well, you know,###i agree with you,###i know 0 teachers are just like everybody else,###same problems the same, uh, good qualities as anybody else.###speakerb86.###yeah.###speakera87.###speakerb88.
110447:93	if it, if it's if it was true there, i'm sure it's true with just about probably to some degree every school 0 there is *t*-1	probably	###because it does, you know,###speakera91.### you, you think 0 the benefit would be greater than the,###speakerb92.###yeah,###because, you know, as i say, i'm sitting there *-1 fussing and fussing,###and yet, i know of, you know, one teacher who *t*-1 was an alcoholic in school as well as, you know, i presume out,###speakera93.###uh-huh.###speakerb94.###speakera95.###and that was in your children's high school,###speakerb96.###uh-huh.###speakera97.###isn't that amazing,###speakerb98.###and, you know, my children brought it to my attention.###i never was there *-1 to see it.###speakera99.
110458:4	certainly not,	certainly	###and that was in your children's high school,###speakerb96.###uh-huh.###speakera97.###isn't that amazing,###speakerb98.###and, you know, my children brought it to my attention.###i never was there *-1 to see it.###speakera99.### if it, if it's if it was true there, i'm sure it's true with just about probably to some degree every school 0 there is *t*-1###speakerb100.###speakera101.###speakerb102.###uh-huh.###speakera103.###you know, because they represent a pretty good,###speakerb104.###and that's not giving a good example to students.###speakera105.###no,
110459:4	certainly not,	certainly	###speakerb96.###uh-huh.###speakera97.###isn't that amazing,###speakerb98.###and, you know, my children brought it to my attention.###i never was there *-1 to see it.###speakera99.### if it, if it's if it was true there, i'm sure it's true with just about probably to some degree every school 0 there is *t*-1###speakerb100.###speakera101.###speakerb102.###uh-huh.###speakera103.###you know, because they represent a pretty good,###speakerb104.###and that's not giving a good example to students.###speakera105.###no,###certainly not,
110716:22	and i thought, that's probably a good idea because you really	probably	###speakera102.###i was afraid 0 i'd make the car overheat.###speakerb103.###it's hard on the car.###speakera104.###yeah,###so i would roll my windows down,###it was still a hundred degrees###speakerb105.###oh.###speakera106.###and i would just be sweltering hot by the time 0 i picked my daughter up *t*-1,###and um, i had a friend who *t*-1 used *-2 to take shorts to work,###speakerb107.###yeah.###speakera108.###and after work she'd go in the bathroom and change her clothes###speakerb109.###oh, that's funny,###speakera110.
110763:15	i think 0 maybe we've given our teachers a almost impossible job.	maybe	###i've always been a creature of comfort, too###speakera122.###me, too.###speakerb123.###if it's not comfortable, * forget it.###speakera124.###i know,###that's how i am *t*-1, too,###speakerb125.###wool was never comfortable to me.###speakera126.###right,###me neither,###i have,###speakera1.###do you see anything wrong with public school systems?###speakerb2.###well, yes,###i do.###um, i think 0 i'm concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected *-1 to, to deal with *t*-2 in some quality way.
111390:25	so there, there might be,	might	###and the dog rode in the car###and we stopped along the way and had a bite 0 * to eat *t*-1###and they left the dog in the car,###and i guess 0 while we were inside *-1 eating, thumper just tore the heck out of the inside of the car,###and, uh, finally we made it back to, uh, to carney###and,###speakera1.###okay.###where do you enjoy *-1 dining out *t*-2?###speakerb2.###oh, i generally go to the quickie places just because they're cheap.###speakera3.###yes,###do you have children?###speakerb4.###uh, we have four,###but most of them are gone now###speakera5.###uh.###speakerb6.
111477:10	so that might be why i look for inexpensive places *t*-1 just because we're eating out probably five nights a week maybe.	might	###that's what you find *t*-1,###right,###speakera35.###i know.###speakerb36.###my husband likes, uh, dairy queens.###he likes their milk shakes and their chili cheese dogs, i guess 0 *t*-1,###speakera37.###uh-huh.###speakerb38.###so he's a fan of, of dairy queen,### and, and we'll go even in town here at times, just as a, a change although i'm not that excited about it.###speakera39.###uh-huh.###speakerb40.###but we've eat, we eat out so much 0 it's gotten so i don't like *-2 to really eat any place###but yet i hate *-1 to cook food at home###speakera41.###oh.###speakerb42.

111520:5	maybe we avoided wendy's the last few years because our daughter worked there	maybe	###speakerb52.###so mine is, monetarily, i guess 0 *t*-1 strongly monetarily based.###uh, we'll go *-1 get pizza and, uh, at little caesar's, although the kids prefer domino's.###speakera53.###oh, we are little caesar fans here###speakerb54.###right.###speakera55.###that's where we always go *t*-1,###speakerb56.###but it's just a lot cheaper than, than domino's,###so that's.###we go to grandy's quite a bit i would say 0 *t*-1.###speakera57.###yes,###we like grandy's, too.###speakerb58.###mcdonald's, uh, we've sort of been off of that for a while###and no particular reason,###and i,
111584:11	he'd probably just like *-1 to stay home.	probably	###speakera77.###but they have real good signature salads *ich*-1 there and nice steaks,###so, that's our nice place 0 * to go *t*-1.###we don't usually take the kids when we go there *t*-1,###speakerb78.###but well, we don't go out that much,### i gue-, well, i guess 0 we do go out without kids.###we're usually picking things up quickly,###though we just don't dwell on food too much,###speakera79.###yeah.###speakerb80.###and, uh, with my husband traveling he can get all *ich*-2 0 he needs *t*-1 of that during the week *-3 going to those places###speakera81.###right,###speakerb82.###speakera83.###that's right.###speakerb84.###so, it doesn't really matter to him.
111772:7	and possibly not, well,	possibly	###now, texas, is capital punishment for,###it used *-1 to be just capital murder,###and now the-, they added mass murder.###are those the only two things that we, uh###speakera53.###i really would have no idea.### i, um, i don't, don't really know.###speakerb54.###uh, you know, because i have a feeling 0 it is *?*,###and i, i think 0 there ought *-1 to be more things added * to it.###speakera55.###uh-huh###speakerb56.###uh,###speakera57.###that would be pretty lenient in my opinion.###speakerb58.###yeah,### i, i think 0 that's, i, you know, uh,###* killing a child, or kidnapping, uh,
111773:15	i guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt *-1, you know,	maybe	###it used *-1 to be just capital murder,###and now the-, they added mass murder.###are those the only two things that we, uh###speakera53.###i really would have no idea.### i, um, i don't, don't really know.###speakerb54.###uh, you know, because i have a feeling 0 it is *?*,###and i, i think 0 there ought *-1 to be more things added * to it.###speakera55.###uh-huh###speakerb56.###uh,###speakera57.###that would be pretty lenient in my opinion.###speakerb58.###yeah,### i, i think 0 that's, i, you know, uh,###* killing a child, or kidnapping, uh,###and possibly not, well,
111774:31	if they release them two hours later, he probably doesn't deserve the death penalty,	probably	###and now the-, they added mass murder.###are those the only two things that we, uh###speakera53.###i really would have no idea.### i, um, i don't, don't really know.###speakerb54.###uh, you know, because i have a feeling 0 it is *?*,###and i, i think 0 there ought *-1 to be more things added * to it.###speakera55.###uh-huh###speakerb56.###uh,###speakera57.###that would be pretty lenient in my opinion.###speakerb58.###yeah,### i, i think 0 that's, i, you know, uh,###* killing a child, or kidnapping, uh,###and possibly not, well,###i guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt *-1, you know,
111923:22	but that's probably, i mean that's a good, that's a good sign.	probably	###that's what he,###tha-,###in fact, you're about the third or fourth person in the last month that *t*-1 said that.###speakerb54.###uh-huh.###speakera55.###so i guess 0 we'll have *-1 to do it.###speakerb56.###it's,###you always stand in line when you go *t*-1###speakera57.### that's what it, that's what###speakerb58.###but it's worth the wait.###speakera59.###d magazine said that.###it said 0 there was always a line.###speakerb60.###uh-huh.###speakera61.
112039:21	you know, it would probably take my whole paycheck * just to go in and have one meal up there	probably	###speakera99.###speakerb100.###speakera101.###uh-huh.###speakerb102.###of course, you know, down, next to downtown up around mckinney and everything you know, there's just a, there's a different class of restaurants *ich*-2 up there that i can't even touch *t*-1.###speakera103.###uh-huh.###speakerb104.###speakera105.###well, that's exactly true.###speakerb106.###speakera107.###that's right.###speakerb108.###speakera109.###that's right.###yeah.###that's right.###speakerb110.
112320:32	and it's, it's certainly not at all common,	certainly	###so i can help her with that###and she gives me ideas for my writing too###so.###speakerb62.###uh-huh.###speakera63.###yep.###speakerb64.###uh-huh.###oh, well, good.###well, i, you know, in terms of, in terms of any sorts of trends i, you know,### obv-, obviously things are different from, *ich*-2 for me *ich*-1 than, and my children than when i was growing up *t*-3.###speakera65.###yeah.###speakerb66.### i, i, i grew up on a farm, uh, in iowa,###and, uh, you know the whole family was around the, the whole time.###and then what my father did *t*-1 was, was, uh, in-, you know, obvious to me###and i, i helped out with it.###but, uh, although i have brought my boys into *-2 to see where i work *t*-1, it's not that easy,
112472:59	but i was thinking, oh, my gosh, if they had very many babies, they couldn't possibly get them all out.	possibly	###oh, i know.###we,###speakera29.###you would have *-1 to be able *-2 to have enough,###you know, you'd have *-1 to be able *-2 to get them all out.###speakerb30.###what we do *t*-3 is we have these cribs in the back room where they sleep *t*-2 that *t*-1 are, um, low to the ground###speakera31.###uh-huh.###speakerb32.###and they're reenforced *-1 *-2 real strong###and they'll sit four babies.###we would just lie them in there###and they roll real well and maneuver.###speakera33.###oh, well, that's, that's a,###speakerb34.###that will get them out.###speakera35.###i hadn't thought about that.
112487:11	that's certainly something 0 we hope 0 *t*-1 never happens.	certainly	###oh, well, that's, that's a,###speakerb34.###that will get them out.###speakera35.###i hadn't thought about that.###but i was thinking, oh, my gosh, if they had very many babies, they couldn't possibly get them all out.###speakerb36.###no.###speakera37.###but you could put them in one of these cribs and then roll the crib out i guess 0 *t*-1.###speakerb38.###right.###speakera39.###oh###speakerb40.###right.###speakera41.###well, that's neat.###speakerb42.###yeah,
112527:17	those are the, probably the bestes-, the best group 0 * to have *t*-1.	probably	###speakerb50.###it *exp*-1's easy * to get attached to them too.###speakera51.###yeah.### how old a group, how old are the children go *t*-2 with this center where you work *t*-1?###speakerb52.###um, in my room they go from eight weeks to nine months.###speakera53.###uh-huh.###speakerb54.###and throughout the center it goes up to like age twelve.###speakera55.###uh-huh.###speakerb56.###so, i have the real, real young ones in my room.###speakera57.###you've got the little bitty ones.###speakerb58.###uh-huh.###speakera59.
112628:23	um, i need *-1 to definitely take a vacation where all, all 0 i do *t*-2 is * rest *t*-3.	definitely	###oh, my god.###speakera91.###and this was four hours later, you know.###speakerb92.###oh, that poor child.###speakera93.### and, uh, so, you know, i-,###what do you do *t*-1?###speakerb94.###that's awful.###speakera95.###so she has switched to a different center now###and, uh,###speakerb96.###well, i,###speakera1.###well, the types of vacations that i usually take *t*-1,###i usually come back *-1 more tired *ich*-2 after my vacation, then i do, you know, before i take it.###speakerb2.###speakera3.
112629:36	and i guess 0 *-2 to do that i'd probably have *-1 to take it at home.	probably	###speakera91.###and this was four hours later, you know.###speakerb92.###oh, that poor child.###speakera93.### and, uh, so, you know, i-,###what do you do *t*-1?###speakerb94.###that's awful.###speakera95.###so she has switched to a different center now###and, uh,###speakerb96.###well, i,###speakera1.###well, the types of vacations that i usually take *t*-1,###i usually come back *-1 more tired *ich*-2 after my vacation, then i do, you know, before i take it.###speakerb2.###speakera3.###um, i need *-1 to definitely take a vacation where all, all 0 i do *t*-2 is * rest *t*-3.
112674:8	you might be like i am *?*.	might	###speakerb14.###and, uh, i was standing in water not more than, in barely above my ankles###speakera15.###uh-huh.###speakerb16.###and, uh, you know when the waves go in the waves go out *t*-1 they kind of###all of a sudden you're in sand above your ankles.###speakera17.###right.###speakerb18.###and i was standing there *-1 talking to my daughter###and this really big wave came and totally threw me,###and one foot did not come out of the sand,###and it tore the ligaments in my knee.###speakera19.###uh-huh.###speakerb20.###so i'm never going to another beach again, ever.###i'm ma-,###speakera21.
112806:79	and, uh, you know, i think 0 if i had, if i had the money, i would probably go to europe every year.	probably	###speakerb66.###uh-huh.###speakera67.###speakerb68.###yeah,###i just, uh,### that, that does absolutely nothing for me.###speakera69.###uh-huh.###speakerb70.###but, uh, i don't know###i can say that i think 0 my, my favorite spots are still * to go, *-1 to go where there's mountains and, and a lot of trees and, and wildlife 0 * to view *t*-2 *t*-3### and, and, uh, i like that kind of stuff.###i could just sit there all day and look at the scenery.###speakera71.###yes.###speakerb72.###speakera73.### i, i agree.### i can, i can do that too,
112903:10	or i probably wouldn't have been there.	probably	###and wasn't that fun.###i went to the balloon festival in plano and carried my little portable radio with me,###speakera17.###speakerb18.###and i must say 0 i attracted a lot of attention.###speakera19.###i bet.###speakerb20.###people running up saying, oh, what's the score *t*-1, what's the score *t*-2?###speakera21.###oh, boy, i bet 0 all the men that *t*-1 got direct down there were just right on it.###speakerb22.###that's right###and that's exactly what they said *t*-1,###my wife dragged me away from the television.###speakera23.###yep.###speakerb24.###you know, but i wasn't,###i had forgotten
112933:35	and if you want *-1 to see them, you might just as well enjoy football.	might	###speakerb26.###yeah.###speakera27.### and, uh, so when i met my husband *t*-1, he was watching football###and i figured out that i couldn't see him all weekend.###i couldn't see him until like tuesday because monday night football, if i didn't, like football.###speakerb28.###speakera29.###so,###speakerb30.###that's exactly where both of the wives came from *t*-2 i think 0 *t*-1.###speakera31.###yep.###speakerb32.###it was, uh, you know,###it *exp*-2's easier *ich*-1 * to join them than * fight them.###speakera33.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakerb34.
112970:13	but you'll probably always have a soft spot in your heart *ich*-1 though for for denver.	probably	###speakera41.###well, i guess 0 we'll first have *-1 to get to used to the idea that we're staying here.###speakerb42.###yeah.###speakera43.###that's even harder.###but,###speakerb44.###are you, uh, transit usually?###i mean do you stay not in one place too long?###speakera45.###no,###we're just,###this is only the second place 0 we've lived *t*-1.###we've only been married for five and a half years.###and, uh, we have two small children,###and he had a, uh, just got transferred *-1 here to e-systems,###so.###speakerb46.###well, it will take you a little while
113073:4	definitely.	definitely	###uh-huh.###speakera75.###that was kind of a funny song###but they sure do,###it seems to me like they really love their cowboys here.###even when they were losing pitifully *t*-1, you know, people still support them.###we drive by some houses *ich*-2 everyday that *t*-1 have big signs,###we love the cowbo-,###speakerb1.###so do you have an opinion on credit cards?###speakera2.###um, i do.###speakerb3.###you do?###speakera4.### what, what do you think *t*-1 about them?###speakerb5.###i think 0 they get a lot of people in trouble.###speakera6.###yeah,
113220:189	i think 0 if card cards were as, as stringent as say a, a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have *-1 to, you know, be able *-2 to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills *t*-4, we probably wouldn't have the problems 0 we have *t*-3.	probably	###we just waited until time *ich*-2 come around that we could afford it *t*-1.###speakera52.###right.###speakerb53.###and you know, we had all the necessities,###so. and i very seldom use a credit card on necessities.###i always use it for something 0 i want *t*-1 not something 0 i need *t*-2.###speakera54.###exactly.###speakerb55.###so,###speakera56.###yeah,###my parents are really good about * not using credit cards.###they are against it.###speakerb57.###yeah.###speakera58.###i don't think 0 they like the fact that i have one either.###speakerb59.
113327:21	i think 0 that would probably, uh, be very possible,	probably	###uh, fifteen or twenty i guess *t*-1.###speakera94.###oh, really?###speakerb95.###oh, yeah.###speakera96.###do you do it every day?###speakerb97.###i try *-1 to *?* every day.### i, uh, i get calls at work,###i get calls at home,###so.###speakera98.###wha-,###speakera1.###okay.###i've got a, you know,###i have a real good method of * starting *-1 to get the budget balancing *-2###and then that's * get half of the government, rid *-1 of the half of the government payroll.###speakerb2.
113339:74	and in light of these, uh, hearings 0 we've all been sitting through *t*-1 the last two weeks, we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed.	definitely	###speakera98.###wha-,###speakera1.###okay.###i've got a, you know,###i have a real good method of * starting *-1 to get the budget balancing *-2###and then that's * get half of the government, rid *-1 of the half of the government payroll.###speakerb2.###i think 0 that would probably, uh, be very possible,###speakera3.###speakerb4.### and, and we really wouldn't feel it in our services.###speakera5.###not all,### i, you know, i don't know if you've ever been to washington d c.###speakerb6.###yes,###i have *?*.###speakera7.###uh, you, you've seen that which *t*-1 was on there and the offices
113347:67	and the other thing is, uh, besides that 0 i think, uh, 0 two things that * very definitely need * looking at *t*-1, one is foreign aid.	definitely	###i think 0 that would probably, uh, be very possible,###speakera3.###speakerb4.### and, and we really wouldn't feel it in our services.###speakera5.###not all,### i, you know, i don't know if you've ever been to washington d c.###speakerb6.###yes,###i have *?*.###speakera7.###uh, you, you've seen that which *t*-1 was on there and the offices###and in light of these, uh, hearings 0 we've all been sitting through *t*-1 the last two weeks, we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed.###speakerb8.###right.###speakera9.###they really don't have enough * to keep them busy * to keep their noses at, in their own business of what they're doing *t*-1.###speakerb10.###right.###speakera11.
113427:5	maybe if they ever get to the point	maybe	###amen.###speakera35.###but that's, uh,###yeah,###i don't know what we're going *-1 to be able *-2 to do *t*-3 about it###but i guess 0 it's sitting around so long that it's sort of like our mortgages.###i don't ever expect *-1 to pay mine off before i die###so i guess why should the government *?* *t*-1.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###isn't,###that's the way 0 they're thinking these days anyway *t*-1.###speakerb38.###it seems, seems *-1 to be *?*.### i, you know, i,###it really does bother me when i think about, you know, * leaving our children with, with this sort of, uh, a national problem that we can't seem *-1 to find an, an answer to *t*-2 it *t*-3, uh,###i don't know.###speakera39.### i, i don't think 0 it ever will *?* really.###i,
113433:122	if they were *-1 to take half of what they spend *t*-3 on that and put it on some economic, you know, inter-, intergovernmental or inter united states like programs that one really might *?*.	might	###i don't ever expect *-1 to pay mine off before i die###so i guess why should the government *?* *t*-1.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###isn't,###that's the way 0 they're thinking these days anyway *t*-1.###speakerb38.###it seems, seems *-1 to be *?*.### i, you know, i,###it really does bother me when i think about, you know, * leaving our children with, with this sort of, uh, a national problem that we can't seem *-1 to find an, an answer to *t*-2 it *t*-3, uh,###i don't know.###speakera39.### i, i don't think 0 it ever will *?* really.###i,###maybe if they ever get to the point### the biggest, you know, the biggest outlaid expense has always been either wars or defense.###speakerb40.###right.###speakera41.###really.
113477:11	we've probably been on long enough.	probably	###she's a,###we're not feeling too well over here so that,###speakera49.###oh, really?###speakerb50.###yeah.###speakera51.###oh, that's a shame.###she's not the one going to washington, huh?###speakerb52.###no,###no.###she's,###speakera53.###oh.###speakerb54.###i don't think 0 i could part with her.###speakera55.###okay.###okay, geri.
113482:23	but i think 0 that will probably do it	probably	###yeah.###speakera51.###oh, that's a shame.###she's not the one going to washington, huh?###speakerb52.###no,###no.###she's,###speakera53.###oh.###speakerb54.###i don't think 0 i could part with her.###speakera55.###okay.###okay, geri.###we've probably been on long enough.###speakerb56.###okay.###speakera57.###they didn't cut us off,
113572:5	maybe it should be, uh, well, it should be given *-1, you know, i, i won't say *rnr*-2 sparingly,	maybe	###speakerb24.###speakera25.###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###speakera27.###uh-huh.###speakerb28.###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb30.###but, uh, we have,###the death penalty is not given *-1 often.###speakera31.###huh-uh.###speakerb32.###but there have been w-,###speakera33.###it's not *?* *-1 here either really.###speakerb34.###and you know, i,
113619:67	and at that point you know i, i really think 0 there needs *-1 to be maybe a shorter appeal process.	maybe	###it works###and then again it *exp*-1 takes too long for it to work.###speakerb46.###and it seems even though, you know, that they got,###the prisoner himself can come to the point that, hey, i'm tired *t*-1.###i just want out.###speakera47.###uh-huh.###speakerb48.###you know, i'm tired of *-1 fighting it.###speakera49.###uh-huh.###speakerb50.###then the system just keeps on.###speakera51.###uh-huh,###yeah.###yeah,###it equ-,###speakerb52.
113667:23	i think 0 the facts would probably back it up	probably	###but,###speakerb60.###we've gotten into a very litigious, uh, type of life.###speakera61.###boy, haven't that we *?* though.###we really have *?*.###but anyway i'm glad *-1 to hear that you agree with me on the capital punishment.###speakerb62.###well, i just,###speakera63.### i'm, i'm very muchly for it.###* always have been *?*,###speakerb64.###speakera65.###* always will be *?*.###speakerb66.###i just feel like their crime and punishment###and if, if you don't have the punishment, you double your crime.###and the, you know, that is just personal feeling.###it's not going on facts.
113696:11	or maybe, maybe theirs is, in fact, one year of military service for everyone.	maybe	###speakera71.###it could very easily be supported *-1 with facts.###speakerb72.###well, yes.###i,###speakera1.###well, uh, and that's an idea that *t*-1's been around for, kicked *-2 around for a long time.###i don't know that it's ever been seriously considered *-1, uh, as far as close to * passing, uh, any legislation or anything like that.###but, uh, i believe 0 israel does that, don't they for their,###speakerb2.###uh, yes,###i think so.###uh,###speakera3.###wel-,###everybody has * to do, has *-1 to do something.###speakerb4.###yeah,###i don't kn-,###speakera5.

113809:21	and, and maybe that's why we have so many people in society who *t*-1 are not, uh, not really happy *t*-2, you know.	maybe	###yeah.###and, uh, now i didn-, i don't know 0 it di-,### i, i think 0 you're right that that's not the, not the way that the society these days is going *t*-1,###and i, i think 0 we need *-1 to, we need *-2 to try *-3 to figure out some way 0 * to, to turn that around *t*-4 that everybody,###speakerb44.### it's really, it's really unfortunate because when you do,###i do volunteer work for the american lung association.###speakera45.###huh.###speakerb46.###and i have, have done, uh, gone *-1 to work for american heart and just recently for the leukemia society.###and there's, there's no question that *-1 doing, you know, doing that kind of service you get a lot more *ich*-2 out of it than, uh, than the people involved.###speakera47.###yeah.###speakerb48.###uh, it's, it's really a gift to yourself### and, and that's, i think 0 that's a really important lesson 0 * to learn *t*-1.###speakera49.###yeah.###speakerb50.
113823:40	but i-, it, it certainly seems to me that, that, uh, uh, things in, in the last twenty-three years, uh, things hav-, have definitely gone towards, uh, very much the concentration on self and, and loss of, loss of perspective in terms,	certainly	###speakerb48.###uh, it's, it's really a gift to yourself### and, and that's, i think 0 that's a really important lesson 0 * to learn *t*-1.###speakera49.###yeah.###speakerb50.### and, and maybe that's why we have so many people in society who *t*-1 are not, uh, not really happy *t*-2, you know.###speakera51.###well, that could be.###speakerb52.###because if you concentrate all of your energies and efforts on yourself, you're just kind of down the tube, you know.###speakera53.###yeah,###right.###speakerb54.###uh, it *exp*-2 really is better *ich*-1 * to give then * to receive.###speakera55.###yeah,### i, i agree with that,### and, uh, and i, i, i don't know what, what *t*-1 has, what *t*-2 has set it off or what
113823:151	but i-, it, it certainly seems to me that, that, uh, uh, things in, in the last twenty-three years, uh, things hav-, have definitely gone towards, uh, very much the concentration on self and, and loss of, loss of perspective in terms,	definitely	###speakerb48.###uh, it's, it's really a gift to yourself### and, and that's, i think 0 that's a really important lesson 0 * to learn *t*-1.###speakera49.###yeah.###speakerb50.### and, and maybe that's why we have so many people in society who *t*-1 are not, uh, not really happy *t*-2, you know.###speakera51.###well, that could be.###speakerb52.###because if you concentrate all of your energies and efforts on yourself, you're just kind of down the tube, you know.###speakera53.###yeah,###right.###speakerb54.###uh, it *exp*-2 really is better *ich*-1 * to give then * to receive.###speakera55.###yeah,### i, i agree with that,### and, uh, and i, i, i don't know what, what *t*-1 has, what *t*-2 has set it off or what
113968:106	that's, and i think 0 that's pretty crazy, because i mean those students who *t*-1 were in america when that was happening *t*-2 are almost certainly going *-3 to be in trouble if they go back,	certainly	###and they're trying *-1 to get permission for his mother to come to america *-2 to like help *-3 care for the kid and that sort of thing.###and it's turned out *-1 to be sort of a horrible problem.###it *exp*-3's just very difficult * to get a woman who *t*-1 doesn't have a lot of assets or whatever out of china even temporarily *-2 to visit here.###speakera56.###oh, well, then you have first in the experience on immigration.###speakerb57.###yeah.###speakera58.###well, that is interesting.###speakerb59.###uh-huh.###speakera60.###yeah.###well, i wonder, you know, even with those that *t*-1 were involved with tienamen's square.###speakerb61.###right.###speakera62.###you know, did we really protect them?###speakerb63.###yeah,
113973:17	so it *exp*-1's certainly in our best selfish interest * to keep them here if we can *?*.	certainly	###speakerb57.###yeah.###speakera58.###well, that is interesting.###speakerb59.###uh-huh.###speakera60.###yeah.###well, i wonder, you know, even with those that *t*-1 were involved with tienamen's square.###speakerb61.###right.###speakera62.###you know, did we really protect them?###speakerb63.###yeah,### that's, and i think 0 that's pretty crazy, because i mean those students who *t*-1 were in america when that was happening *t*-2 are almost certainly going *-3 to be in trouble if they go back,###speakera64.###yeah.###speakerb65.###and aside for that, they're the best and brightest of china
114175:8	* might as well buy me a new car for that.	might	###because i can't, uh, i don't know if i want *-1 to, you know, pay all these repairs now *-5 to start *-6 getting it fixed *-2 when it's starting *-3 to breakdown *t*-4.###speakera39.###yeah,###i don't want *-1 to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is *?*###and it's not worth it.###speakerb40.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###yeah,###that's true.###i agree with you there.###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###so i don't know,###uh, because i, i need *-1 to have it tuned, you know, tuned *-2 up and i don't know, replace some of the belts.###and i was looking at###the, uh, tires need *-1 to be replaced *-2###and so i was thinking just a lot of money###i'm,
114342:25	and i think that, that is probably the most aggravating.	probably	###you know, i, uh, uh, i did,###my parents live in ohio###so i, i do know something about the, you know, the really cold weather.###and, uh, i've always lived down here in the south,###and, oh, i took my car up there to their house###and, um, i guess 0 i had a crack in the block,###and when i got up there *t*-1 the car,###speakerb1.###well, * let's see.###speakera2.### so what, so what *t*-1 gets you?###speakerb3.###as far as i'm,###speakera4.###speakerb5.###well, the thing 0 i think that *t*-1 annoys me the most is, 0 i have, i have young children, a baby in the house### and, and inevitably as soon as they're asleep, someone calls on the phone *-1 trying *-2 to sell me something.###speakera6.###uh-huh.###speakerb7.
114396:33	well, that, yeah, that might,	might	###i'm not speaking out,###that's for sure.###i just get aggravated about it.###and,###speakera18.### would, would you,###i mean if you could legislate something, what would you legislate *t*-1?###speakerb19.###i really don't know.### i'm, i'm not into, uh, heavy government legislate-, legislating of a lot of different areas,###but i, i don't know.### i just, i do particularly find it annoying.###uh, i'm really not sure.###i haven't given that a lot of thought if, if it should, should go, you know *-1 to be,###speakera20.###yeah.###speakerb21.###speakera22.### it, it seems, it seems to me that we should have the ability * to designate with the phone company that we don't want *-1 to receive calls like that.###speakerb23.
114462:95	so i, i find myself being a l-, a bit abrupt and a little bit ruder than than i might normally be *?*	might	###speakerb45.###i don't mind the children when they're selling things for school *t*-1.###i have kids###and, you know, that's just kind of part of it###speakera46.###yeah.###speakerb47.###but when it's adults selling a variety of things *t*-1 and especially when men arrive at about ten o'clock in the morning *t*-2 uh, that really, it makes you not feel particularly safe###speakera48.###uh-huh.###speakerb49.###speakera50.###yes.###speakerb51.###and, it's annoying as well.###speakera52.### and these, and these people may in fact be just looking *-2 to s-, find an unoccupied house 0 * to rob *t*-1.###speakerb53.###right,### you just, you really don't know,
114553:53	and, you know, this isn't, you know, prob-, most likely not to, going * to be used *-1 against you,	likely	###it's,###speakerb87.###oh.###speakera88.###uh, and i also sort of worry that, you know, that sometimes people giveaway personal information.###uh, when, when the call comes *t*-1 and, and they, uh, you know, sort of seductive, to, you know,###somebody is asking me my opinion on all of these things,###and so i start *-1 answering###and then you, you know, you go down a path###speakerb89.###right.###speakera90.###uh, and you don't know where it's going *-1 to end *t*-2.###speakerb91.###yeah.###speakera92.###uh, in fact, you don't even know what you've eventually, you know, the totality of what you've revealed *t*-1###speakerb93.###well, we,###speakera94.
114626:7	but probably if i didn't have access to one all the time at work, i'd want one at home.	probably	###speakera13.###uh-huh.###speakerb14.###speakera15.###uh-huh.###well, that sounds interesting.###speakerb16.###yeah.###what kind of a computer do you use *t*-1 at work?###speakera17.###i have a, a p s one i b m type.###speakerb18.###uh-huh.###speakera19.###uh, and i use it all day at work###and i put all my personal stuff on it at work.###speakerb20.###uh-huh.###speakera21.###so i really don't, haven't had a need for one at home
114830:47	but they, uh, try *-1 to get as many people as they possibly can *?* to contribute to this	possibly	###speakera99.###to, uh,###it's, uh###speakerb100.###it's almost like that, like a voice command computer type thing, oh.###speakera101.###well they call it *ich*-2 the speech lab that *t*-1 is setting this thing up.###speakerb102.###speakera103.###uh-huh.###speakerb104.###speakera105.###uh-huh.###speakerb106.###speakera107.###they're doing research for a lot of big companies from what i understand *t*-1 on this.###now i don't know, i don't know everything about it###speakerb108.###well, that's wonderful.###speakera109.
114842:13	well, i probably do because i've,	probably	###uh-huh.###speakerb106.###speakera107.###they're doing research for a lot of big companies from what i understand *t*-1 on this.###now i don't know, i don't know everything about it###speakerb108.###well, that's wonderful.###speakera109.###but they, uh, try *-1 to get as many people as they possibly can *?* to contribute to this###and that way they can check voice patterns.###speakerb110.###i see,###different kinds of voices and things.###speakera111.###uh-huh,###and get the computer where it recognizes voices *t*-1.###speakerb112.###wonderful.###see that's why i, it's interesting *t*-1 because you have i, i'm going *-2 to say 0 you have an accent.###speakera113.
114852:10	so i probably do.	probably	###speakerb110.###i see,###different kinds of voices and things.###speakera111.###uh-huh,###and get the computer where it recognizes voices *t*-1.###speakerb112.###wonderful.###see that's why i, it's interesting *t*-1 because you have i, i'm going *-2 to say 0 you have an accent.###speakera113.###well, i probably do because i've,###speakerb114.### and i, and i think that i don't.###i mean to you###but,###speakera115.###speakerb116.###you know.###speakera117.###well, i've been b-, i was born and raised *-1 in texas. have lived here forever
114869:8	i probably went through richardson, then.	probably	###you know.###speakera117.###well, i've been b-, i was born and raised *-1 in texas. have lived here forever###so i probably do.###speakerb118.###and you're in what city?###speakera119.###i'm in richardson.###it's right outside of dallas.###speakerb120.###okay,### my sister, one of my sisters lives in plano.###speakera121.###uh-huh.###speakerb122.###and that's right outside of,###speakera123.###well, richardson's right between dallas and plano.###speakerb124.###how about that.
114871:8	you probably did.	probably	###well, i've been b-, i was born and raised *-1 in texas. have lived here forever###so i probably do.###speakerb118.###and you're in what city?###speakera119.###i'm in richardson.###it's right outside of dallas.###speakerb120.###okay,### my sister, one of my sisters lives in plano.###speakera121.###uh-huh.###speakerb122.###and that's right outside of,###speakera123.###well, richardson's right between dallas and plano.###speakerb124.###how about that.###i probably went through richardson, then.###speakera125.
114980:35	i, i read one, like maybe once a year.	maybe	###speakerb21.###oh, cool.###speakera22.###and, by the way, my name's bill.###i'm from north carolina.###speakerb23.###i'm doug,###i'm from pennsylvania.###speakera24.###uh, i,###* let's see.###what kind of books do you like *-2 to read *t*-1?###speakerb25.###uh, well, a bunch of stuff, i guess *t*-1, uh, fair number of novels, but mostly shorter ones.###and, like, i don't really like the, you know, six hundred page long stephen king novels and all that.###speakera26.###i really have *-1 to be in the mood.###speakerb27.###right?###speakera28.
115105:4	definitely.	definitely	###i'm fascinated *-1 by that.###speakerb71.###uh-huh,###yep.###speakera72.###that,### and, and, uh, even stuff about, not like ghost stories, but real encounters with ghosts and supposedly haunted houses.###speakerb73.###uh-huh.###speakera74.###i like,###i'm kind of a doubting thomas###and i like *-1 to read stuff like that.###some of it really freaks me out.###speakerb75.###yeah.###speakera76.###speakerb77.###uh-huh.###right,
115161:16	and see that's probably all, all 0 i saw *t*-1.	probably	###they have a lot of the same players back.###speakera3.###are we talking about, is this the n b a?###speakerb4.###no,###this is college basketball.###speakera5.###this is college, college,###okay.###speakerb6.###speakera7.###speakerb8.###right.###we have like carolina, and duke, and georgia tech, and n c state, teams that *t*-1 are normally ranked *-2 in the top twenty.###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###so, hopefully we'll have a good year.###i don't really follow the n b a very closely.###speakera11.
115181:9	and, maybe now that that's over they'll, they'll come out of it	maybe	###and see that's probably all, all 0 i saw *t*-1.### i, we have moved in the last couple years from utah to texas###and there's so many colleges and universities in texas,###we haven't really followed them too much###and none of them are our, our alma mater###so, that seems *-1 to help.###speakerb12.###do you like professional basketball?###speakera13.###uh, i, i follow it especially around the playoffs,###so, course, i was real familiar with the utah jazz,###and the mailman or karl malone was, you know, pretty big thing###and, the lakers have always been amazing 0 * to watch *t*-1.###speakerb14.###yeah.###speakera15.### i, i did keep track *ich*-1 a little bit of the mavericks.###they've not had any good seasons for a long time, and have a lot of problems with, with tarpley###speakerb16.###speakera17.
115205:25	but, i think 0 chicago will probably with the n b a again.	probably	###speakera19.###yeah,###i hope 0 they do something.###they need *-1 to *?*###or they're not going *-1 to have any of the team left *-2 at all.###speakerb20.###that's somebody 0 you can get behind *t*-1 and, be patient.###speakera21.###speakerb22.###speakera23.###yeah.###kind of like the cowboys, i guess *t*-1.###speakerb24.###yeah,###they seem *-1 to be kind of not having a very good few seasons.###speakera25.###yeah,###they, coming out of it this year.###we'll see if it's held on.###speakerb26.
115213:11	they'll probably be pretty good.	probably	###speakerb22.###speakera23.###yeah.###kind of like the cowboys, i guess *t*-1.###speakerb24.###yeah,###they seem *-1 to be kind of not having a very good few seasons.###speakera25.###yeah,###they, coming out of it this year.###we'll see if it's held on.###speakerb26.###but, i think 0 chicago will probably with the n b a again.###speakera27.###the bulls?###speakerb28.###yeah,###uh-huh.###speakera29.###yeah.
115225:11	it will certainly be different.	certainly	###but, i think 0 chicago will probably with the n b a again.###speakera27.###the bulls?###speakerb28.###yeah,###uh-huh.###speakera29.###yeah.###they'll probably be pretty good.###course, the celtics are always really, really good, too, with their players.###speakerb30.###that's true.###speakera31.###be interesting * to see how the olympics does *t*-1 this year with all the, the n b a players playing on the olympic team.###speakerb32.###that's true,###it will be interesting.###speakera33.###so,###speakerb34.
115268:8	we definitely will *?*.	definitely	###yeah.###speakerb44.###it's a long season.###speakera45.### it is *?*,###it is *?*,###and that's why i've,###i guess 0 my mind went blank.###it's like last season was so long ago###and i haven't really even started *-1 thinking about basketball yet###so,###speakerb46.###yeah.###speakera47.###but, this wasn't a good subject,###but, we'll see how our predictions come true *t*-1.###speakerb48.###it's a little early.###speakera49.###speakerb50.
115458:7	but maybe next year.	maybe	###to the,###uh, oh, by fort sill there?###speakerb62.###uh, no,###to another f-, a, uh, old indian fort that *t*-1's out there.###* trying *-1 to think of the name of it.###durn.###well, yeah,###no,###sorry,###no memory.###speakera63.###uh-huh.###speakerb64.###speakera65.###have you gone, like to fillmont with the boy scouts?###speakerb66.###no,###i missed out this last year.###i wasn't able *-1 to get the time off,
115490:21	sometimes i think 0 that might not be a bad idea.	might	###like you, you know, for a vacation you'd go *-1 backpacking?###speakerb70.###uh, no,###not quite because i'm not a whole family.###i'm just me.###speakera71.###oh, okay.### you just, oh,### and, and you volunteer for the boy scouts, huh?###speakerb72.###oh, yeah,###i rent my kids.###speakera73.###uh-huh.###well, s-, sometimes, uh,###speakerb74.###it's better than, you know, * owning on them and making payments on them, and, you know, things like that.###speakera75.###speakerb76.###speakera77.
115511:4	probably,	probably	###speakerb78.###speakera79.###have,###uh, you said 0 you did it in the high sierras.###uh, do you ever, you know, just vacation someplace where you strictly backpack *t*-1?###speakerb80.###oh, yeah,###yeah.###uh, not recently because, you know, like the boy scouts makes it so that i go like once a month, you know. someplace.###speakera81.###uh-huh.###speakerb82.###but, uh, there's, uh, some, some stuff that i want *-1 to do *t*-2 with like sierra club and go down to grand canyon or something like that.###so, you know, they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together *t*-2 and off you go *t*-1 *t*-2.###speakera83.###uh-huh.###speakerb84.###which *t*-3 seems kind of reasonable because that means 0 you don't have *-1 to take twenty thirteen year olds with you, which *t*-2 seems a, a, just a tad more relaxing.###speakera85.###well, i,
115512:4	probably.	probably	###speakera79.###have,###uh, you said 0 you did it in the high sierras.###uh, do you ever, you know, just vacation someplace where you strictly backpack *t*-1?###speakerb80.###oh, yeah,###yeah.###uh, not recently because, you know, like the boy scouts makes it so that i go like once a month, you know. someplace.###speakera81.###uh-huh.###speakerb82.###but, uh, there's, uh, some, some stuff that i want *-1 to do *t*-2 with like sierra club and go down to grand canyon or something like that.###so, you know, they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together *t*-2 and off you go *t*-1 *t*-2.###speakera83.###uh-huh.###speakerb84.###which *t*-3 seems kind of reasonable because that means 0 you don't have *-1 to take twenty thirteen year olds with you, which *t*-2 seems a, a, just a tad more relaxing.###speakera85.###well, i,###probably,
115679:72	and, i'd say, well, i'm going *-1 to leave the boat out, because, uh, we'll probably do this again tomorrow.	probably	###okay.###speakera49.###and we go out and take them out on their barge.###they're getting kind of old###and they like us to take them out on their barge quite often,###so we we get out on the water occasionally, you know.###speakerb50.###oh, that's nice.###speakera51.###speakerb52.###yeah.###speakera53.###but, uh, uh, anyway, it's, it's, it's fun.### i, i do enjoy the lake,###but, uh, once the children were grown *-1,###and we'd go down there###and i'd get the boat out on the, you know, saturday,###and we'd go for a ride and enjoy it so much.###it's such a pretty lake down there.###we'd enjoy it so much
115702:11	it's probably the prettiest lake in the state of texas.	probably	###and i'd have *-1 to go *-2 load it up the next day.###and,###speakerb54.###where is that *t*-1?###speakera55.###uh, mount vernon.###speakerb56.###yeah.###speakera57.###cypress springs,###cypress cr-, creek springs.###speakerb58.###okay,###that's south of here?###speakera59.###yeah,###it's down at mount vernon.###speakerb60.###okay.###speakera61.
115944:141	i think 0 *-1 living in richardson, we're kind of spoiled because i think 0 we get, we come closer to *-2 getting our money's worth as far as the city is concerned, i think than probably any, any city in the country.	probably	###i think 0 we've, uh, yeah, we have got it on the line, don't we.###speakera34.###our taxes went up tremendously.###speakerb35.###speakera36.###yes.###speakerb37.###and it's not going *-1 to get any better.### d-, you know, i mean, it's going up and up and up.###uh, i used *-1 to live in the plano school district,###and, uh, there was a, an organization, a taxpayers organization that, uh, *t*-3 finally communicated the message *ich*-2 to the, i think to the people in plano that, you know, we didn't want our taxes raised *-1.###speakera38.###yes,###i remember 0 there was *?* about four, five years ago.###speakerb39.###yeah.###speakera40.###yes.###speakerb41.###but, this, you know, this, uh,

116436:15	i mean, certainly, you know, you can't just turn them loose in the middle of dallas,	certainly	###speakerb16.###right,###that is so frightening.###speakera17.###it is *?*, you know,###speakerb18.###uh, do you have children in school?###speakera19.###no,###mine are already in college now,###so i don't have *-1 to,###speakerb20.###yeah.###speakera21.###at least when they were in high school *t*-1, it was beginning but not like the rampages.###speakerb22.###well, i have,###my oldest is his first year in high school###so we have all this 0 *-1 to, to look forward to *t*-2,###and it *exp*-1 is really frightening, uh, * to think that you can't even send them to school in safety.
116463:10	well, maybe that's the answer to crime is * getting more prosecution.	maybe	###but i really don't know what they can do *t*-1.###i mean, it's just in so much of society with the violence and the kids having access to weapons and drugs###and i, i really don't know what, what *t*-1 can be done *-2.###speakera25.###yeah,###well, i just, i just don't understand how, of course, in my little world, how guns could be so available *t*-1.###speakerb26.###well, i don't either,###but apparently they just really are *?*.###uh, i mean, to me, in plano you would think 0 that would be about, you know, about as innocent as you could get *?* for, for * being in a, a large area.###but, you know, my son comes home and tells me that, you know, he hears kids talk about *-1 having guns###and, uh, someone came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun.###speakera27.###oh, my heavens.###speakerb28.###and, i mean, it just scared me to death###and, you know, they called the police### and, and nothing happened,###but my goodness, you know, it, it could have *?* easily.###speakera29.
116491:79	well, i can see, you know, especially if you heard screams from a house or something, * not going over there maybe, because, you know, it could be dangerous,	maybe	###yeah.###speakera33.###a woman was raped *-1 in richardson, i read in the paper oh, about a two weeks ago now 0 *t*-2.###and all the neighbors said 0 they heard her yelling for help.###speakerb34.###oh, no.###speakera35.###but nobody, nobody did anything.###speakerb36.###i just can't imagine that.###speakera37.###you know, i mean they heard someone calling for help.###nobody even called the police *-1 to say, you know, i hear a strange screaming###speakerb38.###right.###speakera39.###i'm afraid 0, you know, if you,###i don't blame people with today's society about * going out *-1 to help themselves.###speakerb40.###right,
116492:7	but certainly i can't understand * not calling the police.	certainly	###speakera33.###a woman was raped *-1 in richardson, i read in the paper oh, about a two weeks ago now 0 *t*-2.###and all the neighbors said 0 they heard her yelling for help.###speakerb34.###oh, no.###speakera35.###but nobody, nobody did anything.###speakerb36.###i just can't imagine that.###speakera37.###you know, i mean they heard someone calling for help.###nobody even called the police *-1 to say, you know, i hear a strange screaming###speakerb38.###right.###speakera39.###i'm afraid 0, you know, if you,###i don't blame people with today's society about * going out *-1 to help themselves.###speakerb40.###right,###well, i can see, you know, especially if you heard screams from a house or something, * not going over there maybe, because, you know, it could be dangerous,
116500:7	and probably one of the best things 0 we could do *t*-1 for crime is *-2 to participate ourselves in its prevention.	probably	###i just can't imagine that.###speakera37.###you know, i mean they heard someone calling for help.###nobody even called the police *-1 to say, you know, i hear a strange screaming###speakerb38.###right.###speakera39.###i'm afraid 0, you know, if you,###i don't blame people with today's society about * going out *-1 to help themselves.###speakerb40.###right,###well, i can see, you know, especially if you heard screams from a house or something, * not going over there maybe, because, you know, it could be dangerous,###but certainly i can't understand * not calling the police.###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###i,###speakera43.###i just, you know,### it's, it *exp*-2's really frightening that we're not, we're trying *-1 to live in our own little cocoons
116525:10	well, maybe this thing with, with the child at school, maybe that will make people think a bit more and, you know, take some steps *-1 to, to correct it.	maybe	###but i think 0 that's real dangerous###and, uh, i don't know.###i try *-1 to tell my kids just, *-3 just kind of be aware of what *t*-2's around them, you know###and, if you see a situation that *t*-1 looks like it could be trouble, just * get out of it or call for help, whichever.###speakera45.###yes.###speakerb46.###but, uh,###speakera47.###yeah,###well, you know, the call for help is what *t*-1 scares me now because it, it just,###i don't know,###people just don't,###i don't know,###i can't say 0 they don't care, because people just have *-1 to care about another person.###speakerb48.###yeah.###speakera49.###but it's that * not getting involved *rnr*-2, that impersonal *rnr*-2 society, 0 i think 0 we live in *t*-1 today.###speakerb50.
116525:51	well, maybe this thing with, with the child at school, maybe that will make people think a bit more and, you know, take some steps *-1 to, to correct it.	maybe	###but i think 0 that's real dangerous###and, uh, i don't know.###i try *-1 to tell my kids just, *-3 just kind of be aware of what *t*-2's around them, you know###and, if you see a situation that *t*-1 looks like it could be trouble, just * get out of it or call for help, whichever.###speakera45.###yes.###speakerb46.###but, uh,###speakera47.###yeah,###well, you know, the call for help is what *t*-1 scares me now because it, it just,###i don't know,###people just don't,###i don't know,###i can't say 0 they don't care, because people just have *-1 to care about another person.###speakerb48.###yeah.###speakera49.###but it's that * not getting involved *rnr*-2, that impersonal *rnr*-2 society, 0 i think 0 we live in *t*-1 today.###speakerb50.
116784:21	and we thought, well, maybe they work from, for dallas,	maybe	###um, yeah.###speakerb92.###it was really interesting.###speakera93.###it is interesting.###so,###speakerb94.###do you work for texas instruments?###speakera95.###no,###no,###* just, uh, doing this as a fund-raiser for our church.###speakerb96.###oh, that's nice.###speakera97.###yeah,###so it kind of makes it *exp*-1 easy, you know, * to do a little something for it.###speakerb98.###sure,###because we, uh, we've talked to a lot of people from texas, it seems 0 *t*-1,
116956:38	at times i keep *-1 thinking, though, 0 that might be kind of nice.	might	###all three of my daughters are married,###but, i don't know,###i just still have need for the four bedrooms *-1 just having company from time to time. and some of them coming back home and things, you know.###speakerb66.###right.###speakera67.###speakerb68.###oh, i understand.###speakera69.###and we've got grandchildren now,###so when they come *t*-1, they have *-2 to have a place.###speakerb70.###well, we,###speakera71.###speakerb72.###that's true###and you don't want them to not be able *-1 to come because there's no room.###speakera73.###that's right,###you sure don't.
117143:22	but since that happened, i certainly have *?*.	certainly	###so this is a topic of personal interest.###speakera31.###yeah,###we, uh, uh,###i didn't think 0 ours ever would be burgled into, burgled *-1,###but, so many in our neighborhood had been *?* *-1,###and, uh, because we live on a corner and back up to a real, uh, highly traveled main street.###speakerb32.###uh-huh.###speakera33.###speakerb34.###yeah.###speakera35.###but, uh, we were, so, uh,###speakerb36.### so, so you saw this happening in your neighborhood###and you figured 0 it wouldn't happen to you.###speakera37.###sort of, yeah.###and i never did get a security system,
117210:28	and i think 0 they're probably, i think 0 it probably does these things or sur-, supposedly pretty good.	probably	###but i,###* to answer your question, i think, uh uh, i think, uh, 0 that is a pretty good deterrent in itself,###speakerb58.###yeah.###speakera59.###whether it,###speakerb60.### s-, s-, so you got a sign up there that *t*-1 says 0 you got this alarm system.###speakera61.###uh-huh.###speakerb62.###and what if a burglar comes along and cuts your phone line?###speakera63.###well, it's got a back up system that *t*-1 doesn't work supposedly. tha-, uh, that if *t*-3 it's cut *-2 supposedly *t*-3 it notifies them anyway.###supposedly.###speakerb64.###how does it do that *t*-1?###speakera65.###who *t*-1 knows, you know.###but that's a selling point.
117210:49	and i think 0 they're probably, i think 0 it probably does these things or sur-, supposedly pretty good.	probably	###but i,###* to answer your question, i think, uh uh, i think, uh, 0 that is a pretty good deterrent in itself,###speakerb58.###yeah.###speakera59.###whether it,###speakerb60.### s-, s-, so you got a sign up there that *t*-1 says 0 you got this alarm system.###speakera61.###uh-huh.###speakerb62.###and what if a burglar comes along and cuts your phone line?###speakera63.###well, it's got a back up system that *t*-1 doesn't work supposedly. tha-, uh, that if *t*-3 it's cut *-2 supposedly *t*-3 it notifies them anyway.###supposedly.###speakerb64.###how does it do that *t*-1?###speakera65.###who *t*-1 knows, you know.###but that's a selling point.
117235:15	i would gather probably from drugs.	probably	###speakerb68.###sure.###speakera69.###but, uh, well don't, don't you all have a pretty high crime rate up there?###speakerb70.###well, yeah,###uh,###speakera71.###i'm not saying 0 it's any higher than anybody else's.###down here, we seem *-1 to,### or, or not here,###but the statistics seem *-1 to say that.###i don't know.###speakerb72.### i, i think 0 it's the murder capital of the country now.###speakera73.###is that right?###speakerb74.###yes.###speakera75.
117487:20	and i think 0 we probably will *?* soon as the boys get a little bit older.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakerb78.###and she plays on her school volleyball team and, uh, stuff like that.###but, uh, we, we still, uh, oh, like *-1 to pack up, you know, just go someplace for the day or, uh, you know, just stuff like that.###speakera79.###right.###speakerb80.###one of our older kids now is going to graduate school down at college station###speakera81.###oh, that's nice.###speakerb82.###so that's, uh,###we go down there fairly often, you know, for a weekend for, you know, family get-togethers and stuff like that.###speakera83.###that's great.###speakerb84.###uh,###speakera85.###that's great.###i know 0 we'd, i'd like *-1 to get into *-2 do more camping and outings and things.
117980:9	it probably slipped *-1 loose, didn't it?	probably	###i understand.###my last car repair actually had *-1 to do with brakes###and it's one 0 i did not do *t*-1 myself.###i took the car, my,###i have a seventy-nine el dorado,###* took it *-2 to be inspected *-1###speakera35.###uh-huh.###speakerb36.###and the parking brake failed.###so i got under there and messed with the, the ten-, that, uh, that adjustment 0 *t*-1 to make, to t-, tighten it up###speakera37.###uh-huh.###speakerb38.###and that didn't do the trick###speakera39.###uh-huh.###speakerb40.###and then i got there and tried *-1 to,###speakera41.
118200:29	but it's been that way for the last probably ten years.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakerb36.###and, uh, they have not gotten it where the withholding is accurate *t*-1.###speakera37.###oh.###speakerb38.### so, and, and you withhold no matter what you do *t*-1,###they withhold what they're supposed *-1 to *?* *t*-2###and at the end of the year it's not enough.###speakera39.###oh, great,###so you ought *-2 to be saving up some every month *-3 to make up for all what they should be taking *t*-1 out.###speakerb40.###right,###so now, you know, when you sign your w-four form or whatever, w-two whatever that is *t*-1 *t*-2, then they always say, do you want a extra amount for state. which *t*-3 is ridiculous,###speakera41.###uh-huh.###speakerb42.###speakera43.###speakerb44.
118317:66	and, um, i think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems.	maybe	###speakerb30.###i know.###speakera31.###but the school system's afraid of *-1 getting sued *-2 and, um, all sorts of lawsuits i'm sure 0 *t*-3 because of things like that.###speakerb32.###uh-huh.###speakera33.###speakerb34.###yeah,###yeah.###speakera35.###and, i also believe we don't, even though i feel like i pay a good share towards the school system, that the teachers are still underpaid###and we still don't have enough money towards put * in toward public school.###speakerb36.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera37.###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###speakera39.
118384:13	so this is probably a real hard subject for you.	probably	### i think, with what they have *-1 to work with *t*-2, i think 0 *t*-3 they're doing a pretty good job right now.###speakerb64.###oh, i do too,###i think 0 they're doing real good job.###speakera65.###uh-huh,###so.###speakerb66.###but, then, what do i know *t*-1,###speakera67.###you don't have any children in school? don't have any kids.###speakerb68.###i don't have any kids.###speakera69.###speakerb70.###no,###none at all.###speakera71.###yeah,###okay,
118542:39	i think i think 0 years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals, you know wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood.	maybe	###and, um, you know, you've got a lot of, a lot more women that *t*-2 are working nowadays that *t*-3 aren't home with the children###speakera45.###uh-huh.###speakerb46.###speakera47.###right###and,###speakerb48.###and that may impact it as well.###speakera49.###i think so,### and, and then there's a drop in, uh, the training of morals, really, you know.###speakerb50.###right,###right.###speakera51.### these, some of these young kids 0 you read about *t*-1, * *exp*-2 just doesn't bother them * to kill someone at all###speakerb52.###yeah###speakera53.
118580:30	but now, you know, you wouldn't probably read about it here in texas	probably	###and she wouldn't marry him###and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both,###and, uh,###speakerb62.###you're kidding.###speakera63.###no,###i'm the one,###speakerb64.###himself and her?###speakera65.###yeah,###that must have been at least fifty years ago or more,###but the point of the story is that, that was so unbelievable a thing *ich*-1 in those days that it was in all the papers, all over the country for weeks###speakerb66.###oh, wow,###speakera67.###speakerb68.###i bet.###speakera69.
118703:29	that, and, you know, maybe it's, maybe it *exp*-1's tough for a big powerful nation * to deal with, with, uh, countries like that that *t*-2 depend on us so much without *, you know, just telling them, running their country for them	maybe	###you know, he was just begging her on the phone,###that's not doing anything.###speakerb114.###yeah.###speakera115.###and there are times 0 i think, gee, i mumblex should give my kids gu-,###speakera1.###well, what *ich*-2 do you know *t*-1 about latin american policies?###speakerb2.###well, i think 0 they're kind of ambivalent, really.###uh, i just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations you know.###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.###speakera5.###huh. are you, uh, relating this, uh, to the, uh, affair 0 we've got *t*-1 going on in haiti right now?###speakerb6.### we, we don't know, half the time we don't know who *-1 to support *t*-2.###speakera7.###speakerb8.
118703:43	that, and, you know, maybe it's, maybe it *exp*-1's tough for a big powerful nation * to deal with, with, uh, countries like that that *t*-2 depend on us so much without *, you know, just telling them, running their country for them	maybe	###you know, he was just begging her on the phone,###that's not doing anything.###speakerb114.###yeah.###speakera115.###and there are times 0 i think, gee, i mumblex should give my kids gu-,###speakera1.###well, what *ich*-2 do you know *t*-1 about latin american policies?###speakerb2.###well, i think 0 they're kind of ambivalent, really.###uh, i just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations you know.###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.###speakera5.###huh. are you, uh, relating this, uh, to the, uh, affair 0 we've got *t*-1 going on in haiti right now?###speakerb6.### we, we don't know, half the time we don't know who *-1 to support *t*-2.###speakera7.###speakerb8.
118736:9	maybe i, maybe it's, you know, 0 i'm reflecting how i feel *t*-1 about it,	maybe	###you know, no matter which, no matter which side we take *t*-1, we're going *-2 to have supporters###and we're going *-3 to have, uh, antisupporters *ich*-2, i guess 0 *t*-1, for lack of better term,###and, uh, like you said, they're such small countries, that we're bound *-1 to upset somebody,###but we seem *-1 to be lacking the ability * to take a stance.###speakerb14.###yeah,###it *exp*-2 worries me that, uh, the economy of so many countries in, in south america and central america depend on something that *t*-1 damages people, like the, you know, like cocaine from columbia,###speakera15.###right.###speakerb16.###and uh,, you know, of course i, i'm sure 0 we have some enemies down there who *t*-1 wouldn't care what *t*-2 happened to us,###speakera17.###right.###speakerb18.### but but that is, that's a tough deal,###speakera19.###that's true.###speakerb20.###and it,###i don't think that,
118736:20	maybe i, maybe it's, you know, 0 i'm reflecting how i feel *t*-1 about it,	maybe	###you know, no matter which, no matter which side we take *t*-1, we're going *-2 to have supporters###and we're going *-3 to have, uh, antisupporters *ich*-2, i guess 0 *t*-1, for lack of better term,###and, uh, like you said, they're such small countries, that we're bound *-1 to upset somebody,###but we seem *-1 to be lacking the ability * to take a stance.###speakerb14.###yeah,###it *exp*-2 worries me that, uh, the economy of so many countries in, in south america and central america depend on something that *t*-1 damages people, like the, you know, like cocaine from columbia,###speakera15.###right.###speakerb16.###and uh,, you know, of course i, i'm sure 0 we have some enemies down there who *t*-1 wouldn't care what *t*-2 happened to us,###speakera17.###right.###speakerb18.### but but that is, that's a tough deal,###speakera19.###that's true.###speakerb20.###and it,###i don't think that,
118882:11	i'll probably always have a place here in richardson or dallas.	probably	###but, you know,###speakera11.###oh, but how wonderful.###are you close to *-1 getting it done?###speakerb12.###yeah,###yeah,###it's getting real close to###speakera13.###oh.###speakerb14.###you know, of course there's still a lot of work 0 *t*-1 to be done *-2,###and then when you get it completely, you know, the shell finished *t*-1, uh, you still have a lot of stuff 0 *-2 to do *t*-3 inside,###but, uh,###speakera15.###are you going *-1 to move your whole family over there then?###speakerb16.###no,###actually, uh, i'm not even sure,###i may *?*,
118960:7	but maybe some day they can get closer,	maybe	###he's admissions director.###speakerb38.###speakera39.###uh. university of texas in dallas.###speakerb40.###oh, okay###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###it's just north of me here.###speakera43.###yeah,###well that's, he's got a job there###and this is his first year,###so, it's been a real interesting thing for them.###speakerb44.###that's great.###speakera45.###but they seem *-1 to like it okay.###i think 0 they're too far away from me,
119139:5	maybe i can learn something.	maybe	###speakera109.###uh-huh.###speakerb110.###but my youngest son is a skier.###speakera111.###really,###that's great.###well, my boys are at the point where they scare their mommy to death *t*-1.###speakerb112.###uh-huh.###speakera113.###when they're skiing *t*-1 they're fearless,###and they go off,###speakera1.###mumblex not be a very good conversationalist on fishing.###i don't do a lot of it.###speakerb2.###well, i do love *-1 to fish.###speakera3.###well good,
119195:27	uh, there's a lake like maybe two or three miles from here,	maybe	###speakera19.###uh-huh.###speakerb20.###and then when i get tired of them outwitting me *t*-1, i fish for catfish###speakera21.###uh-huh.###speakerb22.###and we use worms and shiners, which *t*-1 is pretty much like minnows a little bit bigger than minnows,###speakera23.###uh-huh.###speakerb24.###and then i also use spinner baits and plastic worms.###speakera25.###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###it all depends on what i'm fishing for *t*-1, and the time of day.###speakera27.###well, it sounds like you do quite a bit of it.###speakerb28.###i do.
119218:23	i think 0 the lakes are probably different *ich*-1 in michigan than they are in texas.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakerb30.###fishing's a good way 0 * to do that *t*-1,###and i have a lot of friends who *t*-1 like *-2 to go *-3 fishing.###speakera31.###do you have a boat?###speakerb32.###no,###i don't.###i have a friend who *t*-1 has a little infla-, inflatable raft,###and we use that sometimes.###speakera33.###uh-huh.###speakerb34.###speakera35.###uh-huh.###speakerb36.###i wish 0 i had a boat,###but i don't.###speakera37.
119273:16	they are *?*, definitely	definitely	###um i would be afraid of that.###speakerb52.###and i, well, i can't think of a time that i've been fishing *t*-1 that i haven't run into one or two of them *t*-2.###speakera53.###speakerb54.###speakera55.###do they ever get on your hook?###speakerb56.###no,###we, uh,###occasionally i'll catch an eel on a, on a hook, but never the snakes.###speakera57.###uh-huh.###speakerb58.###they just kind of,###speakera59.###are they poisonous snakes?###speakerb60.###uh, we have a lot of cotton mouth,###so yes
119284:49	they can, they're, they're certainly ugly.	certainly	###speakera57.###uh-huh.###speakerb58.###they just kind of,###speakera59.###are they poisonous snakes?###speakerb60.###uh, we have a lot of cotton mouth,###so yes###they are *?*, definitely###speakera61.###uh-huh.###speakerb62.###and they live in little shallow, little coves that i like *-1 to fish in *t*-2,###so i seem them swimming by every once in a while.###speakera63.###yeah,###i think 0 i'd be a little bit afraid of those.###speakerb64.###yeah,
119288:11	it was probably four inches in diameter or something like that you know.	probably	###speakera59.###are they poisonous snakes?###speakerb60.###uh, we have a lot of cotton mouth,###so yes###they are *?*, definitely###speakera61.###uh-huh.###speakerb62.###and they live in little shallow, little coves that i like *-1 to fish in *t*-2,###so i seem them swimming by every once in a while.###speakera63.###yeah,###i think 0 i'd be a little bit afraid of those.###speakerb64.###yeah,### they can, they're, they're certainly ugly.###speakera65.###uh-huh.###we, uh, saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in-laws' place last year.
119297:29	and it was so big, that it might not would have hurt us, but we sure felt like it was hurting us, *-1 just being there, you know.	might	###and they live in little shallow, little coves that i like *-1 to fish in *t*-2,###so i seem them swimming by every once in a while.###speakera63.###yeah,###i think 0 i'd be a little bit afraid of those.###speakerb64.###yeah,### they can, they're, they're certainly ugly.###speakera65.###uh-huh.###we, uh, saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in-laws' place last year.###it was probably four inches in diameter or something like that you know.###great big snake,###and it, of course, it scared the women to death, you know,###but the men come out and said oh, well, that's only a, a king snake,###it won't really hurt you, you know.###but it looked so bad###speakerb66.###yeah.###speakera67.
119306:22	i think that, uh, probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else.	probably	###uh-huh.###we, uh, saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in-laws' place last year.###it was probably four inches in diameter or something like that you know.###great big snake,###and it, of course, it scared the women to death, you know,###but the men come out and said oh, well, that's only a, a king snake,###it won't really hurt you, you know.###but it looked so bad###speakerb66.###yeah.###speakera67.###and it was so big, that it might not would have hurt us, but we sure felt like it was hurting us, *-1 just being there, you know.###speakerb68.###definitely.###speakera69.###but they're scary looking.###speakerb70.###do you have bass?###speakera71.###yes, uh,
119344:10	oh, definitely.	definitely	###oh, no.###speakerb80.###i just go out there and sit and watch other people do it.###speakera81.###uh-huh.###well that's kind of,###we've never entered a tournament or anything.###we're not that big into fishing,###but i see a lot of people, you know,###early in the morning there'll be all the boats going out,###and they'll say, well, there's a big bass tournament this weekend,###and all those people are here for the tournament, you know.###speakerb82.###oh, yes.###speakera83.###so i think 0 there's a lot of people that *t*-1 have, you know, really,###i guess that you'd call it really sport fishing,###they're really into it * to try *-1 to win.###speakerb84.###yeah,
119372:83	i mean, i, i have a friend who, if she likes something, isn't sure what size somebody might need *t*-1, *t*-2 will buy it in every color and size and, you know, take everything back again.	might	###speakerb88.###yeah,###it *exp*-1's a good thing * to take a nice book and sit back and read and fish.###speakera89.###uh-huh.###speakerb90.###that's what i do *t*-1 a lot.###speakera91.###i've never tried *-1 taking a book with me.###i'll have *-1 to try that one of these days.###speakera1.###okay.###when they first said the subject *t*-1, my mind went kind of blank.###i thought, gee, i haven't taken anything back for a long time.###speakerb2.###well, i haven't either, uh,### i, i hate *-1 returning things.###speakera3.###yeah.###speakerb4.
119528:20	and i think 0 that certainly makes a difference from, back from the time when somebody handcrafted something *t*-1 and, you know, had some pride in it *t*-1.	certainly	###speakerb54.### ye-, i think 0 technology is better,### i'm, i'm not sure.###i think 0 you've got a good point with the plastic and that.###speakera55.###about quality.###speakerb56.###i don't think necessarily that, things are being made *-1 better uh, you know,###speakera57.###right.###speakerb58.### i, i,###everything is so automated, uh,###and things *ich*-2 can be made *-1 without, i think a human hand ever touching it, you know an awful lot of things,###speakera59.###yeah,###speakerb60.###speakera61.###yeah.###speakerb62.
119617:21	i think 0 it's definitely time for a change,	definitely	###right.###speakerb18.###and i think 0 there's a limit,###and we passed it a long time ago.###speakera19.###i agree.###we've been writing off way too many bad debts uh, country bad debts.###exactly.###speakerb20.###yeah.###speakera21.###speakerb22.###that's another thing 0 i don't understand *t*-1 is, is, is things like * selling technology and, uh, even military hardware to foreign governments and then forgiving their debt###speakera23.###speakerb24.###to me that just doesn't make any sense, as, as much in debt as we are *?*###speakera25.###i know it.###speakerb26.### i just, i don't know.
119640:75	and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel *t*-1, i think, uh, 0 *t*-2 we might have a, a lot better, a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed *-3.	might	### this it *exp*-2 s-, seems *-1 to be 0 we're turning into a black and white society,###speakera27.###right.###speakerb28.###you either do it this way###or you do it that way,###and there's no in between###speakera29.###that's right,###you're either liberal or you're conservative,###speakerb30.###and that, uh, it obviously isn't working.###speakera31.###well, i think, uh, 0 it wouldn't hurt,###and i know 0 the independent party's been trying for years *-1 to get a, a, a real force in, in the, uh, in congress,###but, uh, you're right,###there's just too many issues that *t*-1 come up that, uh, our senators and our congressmen vote on *t*-2 simply because it's a democratic issue or it's a republican issue###speakerb32.###oh, yeah.###speakera33.
119676:28	but, uh, unfortunately for him, but maybe fortunately for us, his health is not great,	maybe	###yeah,###he's, very ineffective, i think 0 *t*-1.###speakera41.###speakerb42.###speakera43.###well, * let's see,###senators are in for six years, right###speakerb44.###right.###speakera45.###and, uh, when did you guys vote him into office *t*-1?###speakerb46.###oh, unfortunately nineteen ninety.###speakera47.###oh, you're stuck.###speakerb48.###yeah,###we're stuck with him for a little while longer,###speakera49.###speakerb50.
119687:36	not as well as i would like *-1 to *?* probably	probably	###speakerb46.###oh, unfortunately nineteen ninety.###speakera47.###oh, you're stuck.###speakerb48.###yeah,###we're stuck with him for a little while longer,###speakera49.###speakerb50.###but, uh, unfortunately for him, but maybe fortunately for us, his health is not great,###so, i hate,###speakera1.###well, you keep up with current events?###speakerb2.###um, somewhat.###yeah,###somewhat###speakera3.###not,###speakerb4.
119843:150	but, uh, it's, one of the reasons 0 the u s wasn't so, you know, didn't do more than they did *?* at the time *t*-1 because they weren't all that excited about him, although he's probably better than a lot of them,	probably	###speakera61.###speakerb62.###uh-huh.###speakera63.###and i think 0 it's been better since he died,###but it's still been bad###speakerb64.###yeah.###speakera65.###but, uh, even that priest that *t*-1 was in control there for a while that they overthrew *t*-2, uh,###i've read some things about him that he was, he wasn't too good himself.###speakerb66.###oh, yeah?###speakera67.###yeah,###he was pretty, pretty much a,###he didn't mind *-1 having people bumped *-2 off for certain things, you know.###speakerb68.###uh-huh.###speakera69.
119873:60	but then again, so many people you got *-1 to understand only catch it once a day, maybe	maybe	###speakerb74.###yeah,###so what do you think *t*-1 about the quality of news coverage in america?###speakera75.###i think 0 it's pretty darned good,###i think 0 we're lucky *-1 to have as good a coverage as we have *?*###speakerb76.###uh-huh.###speakera77.###i really do.###now, i, they sometimes they jump on it and, and, and go a little to the extreme,###the media does,### but, uh, but, that's kind of understandable, because, you know, of course if you watch it more, more than once a day, i mean, it's the same thing over and over and over and over,###and i listen to the radio###speakerb78.###right,###right.###speakera79.###so i, you hear so much,###you get a little tired of it,
119885:38	well, you know, i think 0 it probably could be, it always could be better,	probably	### but, uh, but, that's kind of understandable, because, you know, of course if you watch it more, more than once a day, i mean, it's the same thing over and over and over and over,###and i listen to the radio###speakerb78.###right,###right.###speakera79.###so i, you hear so much,###you get a little tired of it,###but then again, so many people you got *-1 to understand only catch it once a day, maybe###speakerb80.###yep.###speakera81.###but i think 0 the quality of our, uh, our news is just, uh,###i don't believe 0 it could be better###speakerb82.###uh-huh.###speakera83.###i really don't.###speakerb84.###yeah,
120176:9	and, maybe some day.	maybe	###i bet.###speakerb70.###everything was like an hour or two hours at the louvre, you know, things like that where you need the whole day *t*-1,### but but it really,###speakera71.###right.###speakerb72.###speakera73.###that's where a camcorder would come in handy *t*-1.###speakerb74.###exactly,###that's true.###speakera75.###well that sounds real neat.###so you, you haven't been back to europe since then, huh?###speakerb76.###no,###i always thought 0 i would *?*,###but who *t*-1 knows now.###i got married *-1
120446:47	we went fairly early in the season for this area, which *t*-1 is probably april is when we went *t*-2,	probably	###um, * tell me some about your camping experiences, carolyn.###speakerb2.###well, um, i have gone to girl's camp a few times, as a, you know, a chaperon or a leader, whatever###speakera3.###okay.###speakerb4.###and, uh, i enjoy camping.###i,### we ha-, we have a tent,###and we've gone, even with our family a few times out *-1 camping and have a camp stove, um,###i guess 0 our, our, my biggest memory is when we froze to death *t*-1.###speakera5.###speakerb6.###we just didn't take enough blankets and whatever.###speakera7.### wh-, where do you go *-1 camping at *t*-2 around here?###speakerb8.###speakera9.###speakerb10.###uh, we went *-1 camping at, uh, lake bonham, which *t*-2 is, is pretty close here. um,
120962:39	i mean, right now we're getting taxed *-1 probably, probably around thirty-five percent, or more.	probably	###i see these, these, uh, supervisors running around, uh, having meetings.### i, i really don't know what they do *t*-1.###speakerb18.###right.###speakera19.###i sometimes wonder, are, are they really doing anything,###or,###speakerb20.###right,###well, i think 0 we're going *-1 to see a streamlining in the government.### i just, you know, i, i don't know what kind of, uh, i don't know what, what level, or what, how long it will take *t*-4 for, you know, our country to start, the public in general to start *-1 saying, hey, this is too much.###we're not going *-2 to pay any more. you know,###we're not going *-3 to pay for this,###and you're out, you know.###i think 0 we're starting *-1 to see it a little bit now,###but i think, uh, 0 i don't know what, what kind of input we're going *-2 to get *t*-1 from the public and how they're going *-3 to go about * doing it *t*-4.###because i think, i think 0 we're just getting taxed *-1 way too much.###speakera21.###yeah.###speakerb22.
120962:49	i mean, right now we're getting taxed *-1 probably, probably around thirty-five percent, or more.	probably	###i see these, these, uh, supervisors running around, uh, having meetings.### i, i really don't know what they do *t*-1.###speakerb18.###right.###speakera19.###i sometimes wonder, are, are they really doing anything,###or,###speakerb20.###right,###well, i think 0 we're going *-1 to see a streamlining in the government.### i just, you know, i, i don't know what kind of, uh, i don't know what, what level, or what, how long it will take *t*-4 for, you know, our country to start, the public in general to start *-1 saying, hey, this is too much.###we're not going *-2 to pay any more. you know,###we're not going *-3 to pay for this,###and you're out, you know.###i think 0 we're starting *-1 to see it a little bit now,###but i think, uh, 0 i don't know what, what kind of input we're going *-2 to get *t*-1 from the public and how they're going *-3 to go about * doing it *t*-4.###because i think, i think 0 we're just getting taxed *-1 way too much.###speakera21.###yeah.###speakerb22.
120973:13	but there's probably at least about twenty-five to, to thirty cents of different taxes on, on our gas.	probably	###we're not going *-2 to pay any more. you know,###we're not going *-3 to pay for this,###and you're out, you know.###i think 0 we're starting *-1 to see it a little bit now,###but i think, uh, 0 i don't know what, what kind of input we're going *-2 to get *t*-1 from the public and how they're going *-3 to go about * doing it *t*-4.###because i think, i think 0 we're just getting taxed *-1 way too much.###speakera21.###yeah.###speakerb22.###i mean, right now we're getting taxed *-1 probably, probably around thirty-five percent, or more.###and that's, that's, you know, that's me not making a whole lot of money.###speakera23.###yeah.###well, they got so many hidden taxes, that it *exp*-1's really hard * to figure out how much you are paying *t*-2, because, * go to a grocery store, something like that, and you're paying a little tax here###and you###speakerb24.###right.###speakera25.###so.###gas, i don't know about you guys,
121070:38	it's a plant that we've had *t*-1 for probably twenty-five years that these were cuttings off of *t*-2, you know.	probably	###okay.###speakerb20.###but i still take care of the, you know, flower beds and things like that.###speakera21.###speakerb22.###i was even planning *-1 to go out and to, uh, dig up some hibiscus plants that *t*-2 will not make it through the winter here, but, you know, were planted *-3 in the ground since last spring###speakera23.###uh-huh.###speakerb24.###and i was going *-1 to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me,###and lo and behold, about five days ago, we had a freeze down to about, oh, twenty-three degrees or something###speakera25.###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###so the hibi-, hibiscus plants no longer exist.###speakera27.###oh, that's terrible.###twenty-three de-,###speakerb28.###and i really feel bad about it,

121763:21	they know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years.	probably	### no, no loopholes,###no,###speakera15.###well, and even, even that i don't really know if that would help.###i think 0 a lot of these people do it, uh, mainly because of, of t v###and, a-,###speakerb16.###notoriety.###speakera17.###the double reason ma-,### they, they see it being done *-1 on t v###and also the fact of, of notoriety.###i mean, they become well known.###they are almost like, like a big star.###speakerb18.### ye-, yes,### but, but they, they know that their chances of * actually receiving the death penalty are minimal.###speakera19.###yeah.###speakerb20.
121835:31	but, uh, repeat, uh, crimes uh, maybe not the, the more mild ones but, you know, a more severe ones especially on, on armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people, and not just taking the money but beating them half to death *t*-1.	maybe	### ye-,### if, if he indeed receives the death penalty and it is, it is executed *-1.###speakera43.###the death penalty.###speakerb44.###speakera45.###uh-huh.###speakerb46.###yeah.### but, but the, the, the chances are not great that that will happen.###speakera47.###right.###speakerb48.###but there's a greater chance that he'll be back out on the streets in twelve years.###speakera49.###uh-huh,###yeah.###well, i, i guess 0 i'm also looking at beyond even that.### i, i, i guess 0 i been thinking about it###and i don't have a definite opinion
121934:21	so your privacy is invaded *-1 probably by other members of the family.	probably	###speakera19.###they would think 0 it didn't mean them, i guess 0 *t*-1.###speakerb20.###i guess not,###no.###speakera21.###everybody but me.###speakerb22.###yeah.###speakera23.###oh, goodness.### are you stil-, do you live at home with your parents?###speakerb24.###yes.###uh-huh.###speakera25.###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###yeah.###speakera27.
121959:43	* try *-1 to remember *-2 to respect their privacy, and maybe they will respect yours	maybe	###speakerb30.###yeah.###speakera31.###now what can you do *t*-1 *-2 to stop that?###speakerb32.###oh, i don't know.###speakera33.###speakerb34.###well, i am used to it now,###but sometimes it sort of gets, gets to me###but there is not much 0 i can really do *t*-1.###speakera35.###no.###speakerb36.###no.###speakera37.###* just have *-1 to live with it, i guess 0 *t*-2.###speakerb38.###yeah.###speakera39.
121986:37	i would get in the bathroom and lock the door so maybe they couldn't hear me,	maybe	###speakera43.###do you have brothers?###speakerb44.###uh, no,###yes,###i do,###but they don't live at home.###speakera45.###oh, okay,###i was ra-,###i had two younger brothers,###and they nearly drove me crazy *-1 listening to telephone conversations###and,###speakerb46.###oh, i used *-1 to do that though because i was the youngest,###i would pick up the phone and listen to theirs.###speakera47.###speakerb48.###but i,###speakera49.
122084:30	so when i first moved here *t*-1 i probably did consider that an invasion of privacy	probably	###yeah,###uh-huh.###speakera79.###but,###speakerb80.###yeah,###i've traveled quiet a bit,###and i've been through dallas, texas.###it's pretty busy.###speakera81.###it really is *?*,###and pretty noisy.###speakerb82.###yeah.###speakera83.###it really is *?*.###speakerb84.###yeah.###speakera85.###i live right on a main thoroughfare,
122104:21	i think 0 they would probably have *-1 to pull into my drive before it bothered me.	probably	###so when i first moved here *t*-1 i probably did consider that an invasion of privacy###because it, at first you'd hear a lot of noise, especially at night you know, when you go to bed *t*-1.###speakerb86.###uh-huh.###speakera87.###speakerb88.###oh, yeah.###speakera89.###and every time 0 a, a fire truck or anything went down the road *t*-1, i would wake up,###but i guess 0 i have gotten used to it because i don't even hear it anymore.###speakerb90.###oh, yeah,###i suppose 0 you do.###speakera91.###and, uh, i just close it out, i guess 0 *t*-1,###because i don't, i don't remember *-2 waking up in several years at night when i'd hear a fire truck go by *t*-1, you know.###speakerb92.###uh-huh.###yeah.###speakera93.
122108:10	so that probably wouldn't bother me.	probably	###speakera87.###speakerb88.###oh, yeah.###speakera89.###and every time 0 a, a fire truck or anything went down the road *t*-1, i would wake up,###but i guess 0 i have gotten used to it because i don't even hear it anymore.###speakerb90.###oh, yeah,###i suppose 0 you do.###speakera91.###and, uh, i just close it out, i guess 0 *t*-1,###because i don't, i don't remember *-2 waking up in several years at night when i'd hear a fire truck go by *t*-1, you know.###speakerb92.###uh-huh.###yeah.###speakera93.###i think 0 they would probably have *-1 to pull into my drive before it bothered me.###speakerb94.###yeah.###i am a real solid sleeper though
122166:10	well, maybe you, uh, you have seen dances with wolves.	maybe	###speakera1.###well, have you seen a new movie lately?###speakerb2.###well, uh, i am a student###and i have, uh, been actually watching more movies on video, than * being able *-1 to go out *-2 to see, uh, movies at the store, or at the theater.###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.###uh, i st-, i want *-1 to see the fisher king and, and, uh, catch robin hood.###speakera5.###okay.### i, uh, i haven't seen either one of those.###uh, what, what are some of the shows that you have been able *-1 to rent *t*-2 *t*-3 though?###speakerb6.###uh, * let's see.###uh, i'm trying *-1 to just think of the ones that *t*-2 have come on.###uh, white palace which i thought 0 *t*-1 was over rated, over hyped, um, recently.###well, you're catching me at, it, uh, uh, at mind's end here.###what have you seen *t*-1 recently?.###speakera7.
122302:10	oh, definitely.	definitely	###but it was an enjoyable movie.### it was, it was kind of like the star wars s-, series, you know, just something a little different, yet believable.###speakerb58.###uh-huh.###speakera59.###speakerb60.###right.###speakera61.###speakerb62.###yes.###you're bringing it,###i don't know,### i had a, i sure did have a mind lock about the movies 0 i've seen *t*-1.###but, yeah,###i've seen pretty woman and dances with wolves,###and, uh,###speakera63.###uh, now are you, are you going *-1 to see, or do you, are you much of a star trek fan,###are you going *-1 to see this next one that *t*-2's coming out?###speakerb64.
122339:13	uh, that might be a lot 0 *t*-1 to do with it.	might	###and,###speakera71.###okay.###because we had one here in dallas.###speakerb72.###right,###and they did it in houston,### they did it, well, they did it everywhere.###and it was, it *exp*-2 was really good * to see all the movies and how the story developed *t*-1,###and the thing that i didn't realize *t*-1 is that if you watch the movies in a row, uh, time wise they happen one after another and just no, no time between them,###speakera73.###uh-huh.###speakerb74.###but you can watch the characters develop,###speakera1.###uh, well, i, i guess 0 it's a subject 0 i haven't thought too much about *t*-1.###uh, i don't know if there's so much wrong with the public schools, uh, as much as, we're expecting too much out of them.###speakerb2.###speakera3.###speakerb4.
122408:36	i mean they do that now and they could probably lose their job.	probably	###right.###speakera23.###speakerb24.###right.###i feel the same way.###a lot has *-1 to do with how the kids were raised *-2 *t*-3 at home.###speakera25.###right,###yeah.###speakerb26.###and then when the kids get to school *t*-1, they try *-2 to take away a lot of things that they can do *t*-3 *-4 to discipline the kids.###i mean, they've so severely limited what disciplinary action you can do *t*-1.###speakera27.###yeah,###yeah.### i, i know 0 when i, uh, was going to school *t*-1 it *exp*-3 wasn't uncommon for a teacher to strike a student that *t*-2 was misbehaving.###speakerb28.###exactly.###right.###speakera29.
122451:9	where maybe a physics professor,	maybe	###i know 0 a lot, a lot of,###if you have more money it's just logical that you can provide a better school system.###speakera37.###uh-huh.###speakerb38.###and, unfortunately, there's not many places 0 * to get that money *t*-1.###speakera39.###yeah.###speakerb40.###then if you don't have qualified teachers in the different mumblex,###i know 0 one of my physics professors at college has addressed this.###that most of the teachers at the elementary and high school level aren't scientists,###they're teachers.###and they may not know a lot about what they're teaching *t*-1.###where they may have just had a teaching major and then had some social studies courses *t*-1###and they're trying *-1 to teach social studies.###and they don't know a lot about that.###speakera41.###right.###speakerb42.
122460:32	e-, e-, maybe they should sit back and, and kind of, uh, decide on where the money's best spent *-1 *t*-2.	maybe	###then if you don't have qualified teachers in the different mumblex,###i know 0 one of my physics professors at college has addressed this.###that most of the teachers at the elementary and high school level aren't scientists,###they're teachers.###and they may not know a lot about what they're teaching *t*-1.###where they may have just had a teaching major and then had some social studies courses *t*-1###and they're trying *-1 to teach social studies.###and they don't know a lot about that.###speakera41.###right.###speakerb42.###where maybe a physics professor,### he, my professor was a physics professor###and he said 0 a lot of teachers teaching physics today *ich*-1 have no background of physics at the high school level.###so therefore, they're teaching from a teacher's point of view and not from a physicist point of view.###and that causes a lot of trouble.###speakera43.###right.###yeah.###i don't know,
122465:7	and maybe they should be a little more, uh, uh, concerned with *-1 paying the right people *-2 to teach and, and be, uh, satisfied with maybe a little older school.	maybe	###where they may have just had a teaching major and then had some social studies courses *t*-1###and they're trying *-1 to teach social studies.###and they don't know a lot about that.###speakera41.###right.###speakerb42.###where maybe a physics professor,### he, my professor was a physics professor###and he said 0 a lot of teachers teaching physics today *ich*-1 have no background of physics at the high school level.###so therefore, they're teaching from a teacher's point of view and not from a physicist point of view.###and that causes a lot of trouble.###speakera43.###right.###yeah.###i don't know,### e-, e-, maybe they should sit back and, and kind of, uh, decide on where the money's best spent *-1 *t*-2.###i know 0 in a lot of cases, uh, different districts like *-1 to have nice fancy schools.###speakerb44.###right.###speakera45.
122465:102	and maybe they should be a little more, uh, uh, concerned with *-1 paying the right people *-2 to teach and, and be, uh, satisfied with maybe a little older school.	maybe	###where they may have just had a teaching major and then had some social studies courses *t*-1###and they're trying *-1 to teach social studies.###and they don't know a lot about that.###speakera41.###right.###speakerb42.###where maybe a physics professor,### he, my professor was a physics professor###and he said 0 a lot of teachers teaching physics today *ich*-1 have no background of physics at the high school level.###so therefore, they're teaching from a teacher's point of view and not from a physicist point of view.###and that causes a lot of trouble.###speakera43.###right.###yeah.###i don't know,### e-, e-, maybe they should sit back and, and kind of, uh, decide on where the money's best spent *-1 *t*-2.###i know 0 in a lot of cases, uh, different districts like *-1 to have nice fancy schools.###speakerb44.###right.###speakera45.
122474:29	and the other schools were built *-1 back in maybe the fifties or early sixties	maybe	###so therefore, they're teaching from a teacher's point of view and not from a physicist point of view.###and that causes a lot of trouble.###speakera43.###right.###yeah.###i don't know,### e-, e-, maybe they should sit back and, and kind of, uh, decide on where the money's best spent *-1 *t*-2.###i know 0 in a lot of cases, uh, different districts like *-1 to have nice fancy schools.###speakerb44.###right.###speakera45.###and maybe they should be a little more, uh, uh, concerned with *-1 paying the right people *-2 to teach and, and be, uh, satisfied with maybe a little older school.###speakerb46.###exactly.###because, i mean, here in the town i went to high school,### one of the, there were four high schools in my county, one of the high schools was blown *-1 away by a tornado.###so when they rebuilt that school *t*-1, they had a, a top of the line, high tech school there.###speakera47.###uh-huh.###speakerb48.
122485:13	and it's probably fifty, sixty years old or, or better	probably	###and maybe they should be a little more, uh, uh, concerned with *-1 paying the right people *-2 to teach and, and be, uh, satisfied with maybe a little older school.###speakerb46.###exactly.###because, i mean, here in the town i went to high school,### one of the, there were four high schools in my county, one of the high schools was blown *-1 away by a tornado.###so when they rebuilt that school *t*-1, they had a, a top of the line, high tech school there.###speakera47.###uh-huh.###speakerb48.###and the other schools were built *-1 back in maybe the fifties or early sixties###and then when, uh, the evaluation committees came through *t*-1, they praised the school that *t*-2 had been rebuilt *-3 while they were down grading all these other ones. telling them what they needed *-4 to do *t*-6 *-5 to fix up this building### and this and this and this and so it kind of would make you think that we'd all be better off if all the schools were blown *-1 away by tornadoes and we had *-2 to rebuild them.###speakera49.###yeah.###yeah.###well i, i know, uh, 0 where i came from *t*-1. we didn't have a very, uh, rich community###and, uh, high school that i went to *t*-1 was very old###and, uh, as far as i know, it's still there.###they've e-, expanded on it###but they've never built a new one
122528:11	it's probably up there to twenty now if i mumblex * to start again.	probably	###uh, so, uh, i got *-1 to start all over again.###it's not like * riding a bicycle.###you do tend *-1 to, forget.###speakerb6.###no.###speakera7.###speakerb8.###well, i'm one of those rare left-handed golfers.###speakera9.###oh.###yeah.###speakerb10.###and i do enjoy *-1 playing.###speakera11.###what is your handicap *t*-1?###speakerb12.###right now it's three.###speakera13.###okay.###uh, i was down at about four or five quite awhile ago.
122604:21	i'd say 0 we probably have within fifteen miles, twenty golf communities built * around courses that *t*-1 are pretty well designed and then of course, pine hurst	probably	###but i, i wouldn't, uh, chip well.###one of the two, uh,###or something would go wrong###but i always managed *-1 to, to get near par anyway.###speakerb28.###well, we just had the tour championship here in pine hurst.###speakera29.###oh.###speakerb30.###and i went to that.###craig statler won in a playoff.###speakera31.###uh-huh.###speakerb32.###but we, uh,###this is a big golf area.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###we have a lot of, uh,
122664:15	it's been probably five years since we've had any measurable snowfall.	probably	###speakerb54.###usually january and the first two weeks of february.###speakera55.###well, i wish 0 that's all 0 we had *t*-1.###speakerb56.###but, uh, last week we were in the seventies.###something is coming through now###so it's like in the low forties right now.###speakera57.###oh.###speakerb58.###but, uh, it's supposed *-1 to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties.###we have very windy *ich*-1 winters and very cold.###speakera59.###yeah.###speakerb60.###but we don't get any snow anymore.### i don't, i don't know what *t*-1 changed that pattern.###we used *-1 to get four or five inches a year.###now we get nothing.
122722:13	but i'm probably getting a little too old for that.	probably	###speakera11.###i've just been so busy,###uh,###speakerb12.###uh-huh.###speakera13.###i barely get a chance * to read a newspaper now and then,###so.###speakerb14.###yeah.###i think 0 it *exp*-1's pretty exciting that they can, uh,###it *exp*-3 would be interesting * to see if they can find, uh, other planets that *t*-1 are, that *t*-2 will be more habitable to, uh, you know, uh, humans###and, uh, yeah,###i think 0 i would be very interested in space travel in the future if, uh, if it, you know, if it is at all possible.###speakera15.###yeah.###well, i wouldn't even mind, uh, *-1 being a pilot on one,###speakerb16.###speakera17.###or right now
122724:65	well, i know if they make the advances that they have been making *t*-1, that, uh, maybe age will no longer, age or even physical, uh, abilities may not be, uh, a barrier anymore.	maybe	###uh,###speakerb12.###uh-huh.###speakera13.###i barely get a chance * to read a newspaper now and then,###so.###speakerb14.###yeah.###i think 0 it *exp*-1's pretty exciting that they can, uh,###it *exp*-3 would be interesting * to see if they can find, uh, other planets that *t*-1 are, that *t*-2 will be more habitable to, uh, you know, uh, humans###and, uh, yeah,###i think 0 i would be very interested in space travel in the future if, uh, if it, you know, if it is at all possible.###speakera15.###yeah.###well, i wouldn't even mind, uh, *-1 being a pilot on one,###speakerb16.###speakera17.###or right now###but i'm probably getting a little too old for that.###speakerb18.
122775:15	i know 0 maybe some of the big things that, uh, uh,	maybe	###yeah,###i've h-, seen him before.###speakera29.###speakerb30.###speakera31.### wh-, i-, what would we do *t*-1 without it?.###speakerb32.###yeah.### yo-, we were talking about that just the other day.###what did we do *t*-1 without it back then?###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###i guess 0 there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps.###speakera35.###yeah.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###yeah,### there's, there's a lot of, a lot of little things that *t*-1 have come up.
122776:16	concentrated foods for one maybe	maybe	###i've h-, seen him before.###speakera29.###speakerb30.###speakera31.### wh-, i-, what would we do *t*-1 without it?.###speakerb32.###yeah.### yo-, we were talking about that just the other day.###what did we do *t*-1 without it back then?###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###i guess 0 there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps.###speakera35.###yeah.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###yeah,### there's, there's a lot of, a lot of little things that *t*-1 have come up.###i know 0 maybe some of the big things that, uh, uh,
122887:8	you probably wouldn't have a pretty good list.	probably	###that's right.###and if you are just content with * being, you know, with the way 0 things are *t*-1 then, you know, then you must lead, lead a pretty dull life.###speakera73.###yeah.###speakerb74.###because if yo-,###speakera75.###well, they are always finding easier ways###and, you know, just because they don't talk about it or something like that.###speakerb76.###uh-huh.###speakera77.###and they are doing it un-, you know, unconsciously.###speakerb78.###yeah,###i guess, uh, 0 you don't really think about it too much.###i guess 0 you are always finding newer ways and better ways of * doing stuff###but yo-,### it, it's in a subconscious, you know, thing.###you know, somewhere they can sit down and write down what, you know, things that you've improved upon *t*-1,
122900:13	um, there certainly have been ideas surfaced *, uh, recently, uh, matter of fact repeatedly by many people	certainly	###speakerb78.###yeah,###i guess, uh, 0 you don't really think about it too much.###i guess 0 you are always finding newer ways and better ways of * doing stuff###but yo-,### it, it's in a subconscious, you know, thing.###you know, somewhere they can sit down and write down what, you know, things that you've improved upon *t*-1,###you probably wouldn't have a pretty good list.###speakera79.###uh-huh.###speakerb80.###but you just don't think about them.###speakera81.###right.###speakerb82.###and that's true.###i think, uh, you know,###we've gotten different programs at work, you know, *-2 to, to, uh, make it *exp*-1 visible to management that we are doing things better,###speakera1.###well, i don't know what * to do *t*-1 about the federal budget.
122974:28	oh, i, i definitely would *?*.	definitely	###uh-huh.###speakerb24.###speakera25.###yes.###speakerb26.###they don't make pragmatic decisions.###they make a decision based on consti-, constituency instead of a decision based on what they really believe *t*-1.###speakera27.###yes.###speakerb28.###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb30.###um, you know, th-, or they tack on this, uh, pork bellies and, and do things that, that *t*-1 are good for their area *-2 to pass something that *t*-3 is, that *t*-4 is not good for the country.###speakera31.###right.### so, so you would favor a law which *t*-1 said 0 there could not be lobbyists.###i mean right now lobbyists require * to register###you'd just say, * ma-, make them all.###speakerb32.
123237:23	he's he definitely, uh, is one of the best i think 0 *t*-1.	definitely	###speakera53.###houston.###i saw houston play this summer in memphis.###speakerb54.###oh, yeah?###speakera55.###yeah.###uh, from what i saw *t*-1 they were playing,###when i was at the game *t*-1 we sat right on the front row, right behind the houston oilers,###speakerb56.###huh.###speakera57.###and from what i saw *t*-1 the game houston, houston impressed me a lot.###speakerb58.###huh.###speakera59.###but my brother watched it on t v and said that warren moon was just having an off night,###and if that was an off night i'd hate *-1 to see when he's on a good night *t*-2.###speakerb60.###oh, yeah,
123342:20	but i think 0 it might be them.	might	###speakera97.###and that's, that's where i was *t*-1 when i saw, uh, houston play *t*-2.###speakerb98.###uh-huh.###speakera99.###saint louis is trying *-1 to get a team.###uh, baltimore is trying *-1 to get a team,###and there's some other city.###i'm wanting *-1 to say raleigh durham###but i'm not sure.###speakerb100.###you know, i think 0 you are right.###i think 0 it is raleigh.###speakera101.###* think so?###speakerb102.###i think 0 i remember *-1 hearing that.###speakera103.###uh-huh.###because i know 0 they've got a mumblex football team

123914:53	and, um, the area that we're settled *-1 in *t*-2 is, um, definitely young, young families with, with kids.	definitely	###so i bought one that *t*-1's more like * living in a,###once you're inside, you don't know 0 you're in a town home.###speakera30.###oh, that sounds lovely.###speakerb31.###it is *?*.###they're kind of built *-1 on a catty-cornered instead of like side by side###speakera32.###uh-huh.###speakerb33.###so you don't actually hear anybody next door to you.###speakera34.###uh-huh.###so in, in your area then there's probably a lot of, um, career type people that *t*-1 have those type homes###and###speakerb35.###yes,###definitely.###speakera36.###uh-huh,
123951:13	uh, we definitely have a lot of trees here.	definitely	###uh-huh.###now it's, um, is it very wooded around where you are *t*-1,###there lots of pretty trees and,###speakerb43.###yes###speakera44.###yeah.###speakerb45.###as a matter of fact this is a, uh, this particular community that i live in *t*-1 is very wooded.###speakera46.###oh, how pretty.###speakerb47.###it is nice.###speakera48.###i do miss that.###around here in plano there are very few trees###and it's pretty flat and, and kind of barren###and that's the only thing that we don't like *t*-1 about *-2 living in texas, is 0 we miss all the beautiful trees and the fall### and, and, um, uh, the landscape is much different *ich*-1 here in texas than it is *?*, you know, in the north. um, or even where you are *t*-2.###speakerb49.
123973:46	and if you didn't do anything about it, then they *ich*-1'd probably the leaves just blow away.	probably	###a lot of leaves 0 * to rake *t*-1 up too, i bet.###speakerb51.###yes###but fortunately the home owner's association does all that.###speakera52.###does that,###well, see, that's another plus.###speakerb53.###yes,###i don't have *-1 to worry about that###and this is the time of year 0 we're starting *-1 to lose *t*-2,###they're all falling now.###speakera54.###that's right,###that's right,###they are *?*.###i'm going *-1 to get the kids to get outside with the other neighbor kids and do the little bit of raking that *t*-2 needs *-3 to be done *-4.###we just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but, not, not much.### just, just a little###kind of just in more of a * make a little bit of a mess for a few weeks
124005:71	i, i know that the amount of, or how far your dollar goes *t*-1 probably more than anything has, has greatly changed.	probably	###okay.###it *exp*-1 was really nice * speaking to you.###speakerb59.###it *exp*-1 was good * to speak with you too.###speakera60.###okay,###and * have a happy thanksgiving.###speakerb61.###* thank you,###you too.###speakera62.###bye-bye.###speakerb63.###bye-bye.###speakera1.###uh, well, i guess 0 social change takes in a, a big category,###but, uh, i guess 0 the, the one aspect of it that i took *t*-1 in, uh, consideration is more economical.###speakerb2.###um.###speakera3.
124018:21	and even though the son was probably more successful, you know, higher up in the, the management ladder uh, his, he was actually making less money when you co-, when you go by costs of living *t*-1.	probably	###bye-bye.###speakera1.###uh, well, i guess 0 social change takes in a, a big category,###but, uh, i guess 0 the, the one aspect of it that i took *t*-1 in, uh, consideration is more economical.###speakerb2.###um.###speakera3.### i, i know that the amount of, or how far your dollar goes *t*-1 probably more than anything has, has greatly changed.###speakerb4.###yes,###i agree.###speakera5.###i know, 0 they, they did a,###it was on a talk show,###they took, uh, the parents and then the, uh, the son,###and they compared income at different points in time when the, when the father was, you know, was a little bit younger and more in his heyday *t*-1###speakerb6.###uh-huh.###speakera7.### and they, and they compared to the son's, that he was making *t*-1 now.
124047:43	well, i, i know 0 gas prices have definitely jumped, uh, from, uh,	definitely	###uh-huh.###and it's depending on where you live *t*-1, though, too.###speakera13.###yeah.###i know 0 just, uh, just with me, ten years ago, i was comparing the,###i think 0 i, i was living better *ich*-1 ten years ago than i am *?* now, even though i'm making more money now,###but my dollar went a lot farther.###speakerb14.###yeah.###that's true.###ten years ago i was eleven.###oh. i remember though, like *-1 buying candy and stuff that *t*-2 was a lot less expensive than it is *?* now.###and gas,###speakera15.###yeah.###speakerb16.###and i used *-1 to hear stories from my grandpa,###and, you know, he could see a movie for like a nickel and things like that.###speakera17.###yeah,
124104:4	definitely.	definitely	###oh, like, like social changes.###speakera31.###yeah.###speakerb32.###um, um, and i don't think 0 this would have anything 0 *t*-1 to do with it,###but like clothing and styles, lot of those changed.###speakera33.###okay,###yeah,### i, i, i don't think 0 they, they consider,###speakerb34.###speakera35.###like i say, it's a broad category,###it's just 0 i'm not economical###but uh, even attitudes on, on clothing and stuff, uh, i know *t*-1.###speakerb36.###yeah.###speakera37.###speakerb38.###uh-huh,
124152:5	maybe some day	maybe	###speakera49.###yeah.### i, i, i guess 0 the, the best thing *ich*-3 0 i like *-1 to see *t*-2 from the sixties and seventies is, of course, is the mini skirt, of course.###one of the nice things,###speakerb50.###speakera51.###but, uh,###yeah,###i don't think that there's anything as original,### it's, it's all based *-1 on, uh, one of the past styles,###they just, um, make their, uh, circle and come back again.###speakerb52.###yeah.###speakera53.###so if you hang onto your clothes long enough, uh they'll, they'll be back in style in a few years.###speakerb54.###yeah.###speakera55.###speakerb56.###that's true,
124153:8	i probably won't be alive *-1 to see it,	probably	###yeah.### i, i, i guess 0 the, the best thing *ich*-3 0 i like *-1 to see *t*-2 from the sixties and seventies is, of course, is the mini skirt, of course.###one of the nice things,###speakerb50.###speakera51.###but, uh,###yeah,###i don't think that there's anything as original,### it's, it's all based *-1 on, uh, one of the past styles,###they just, um, make their, uh, circle and come back again.###speakerb52.###yeah.###speakera53.###so if you hang onto your clothes long enough, uh they'll, they'll be back in style in a few years.###speakerb54.###yeah.###speakera55.###speakerb56.###that's true,###maybe some day
124154:10	but prices might go down lot more.	might	### i, i, i guess 0 the, the best thing *ich*-3 0 i like *-1 to see *t*-2 from the sixties and seventies is, of course, is the mini skirt, of course.###one of the nice things,###speakerb50.###speakera51.###but, uh,###yeah,###i don't think that there's anything as original,### it's, it's all based *-1 on, uh, one of the past styles,###they just, um, make their, uh, circle and come back again.###speakerb52.###yeah.###speakera53.###so if you hang onto your clothes long enough, uh they'll, they'll be back in style in a few years.###speakerb54.###yeah.###speakera55.###speakerb56.###that's true,###maybe some day###i probably won't be alive *-1 to see it,
124236:29	but it was int-, it certainly was an exciting series, anyway.	certainly	###and i was kind of, uh, didn't have much interest in the twins, you know,### it was, it was kind of pathetic##, i mean, we only had two radio stations,###and one of them broadcast every twins game live, you know,### and, and the other one was country.###speakerb18.###so you didn't really have a lot of choice, did you *?*.###speakera19.###so, that's right.###speakerb20.###speakera21.###there's was twins *ich*-1 there, or, you know skip williams.###speakerb22.###or country.###speakera23.###speakerb24.###yeah.###oh, uh, and i was routing for the twins myself because, uh, they, a couple of ranger players that i had watched *t*-1 when we first moved here *t*-2, uh, went to minnesota,###and we used *-1 to tease about,###my son and i used *-1 to have a bet *ich*-3 going about some of the players that *t*-2 had moved from here to minnesota,
124295:60	and he said 0 he's been saying one more, and it's been two and three, might be two and three more.	might	###that's right.###speakerb38.###well, i'm a great sports enthusiast,###so i love, you know, baseball teams,###and they,###in fact, on the news tonight, nolan ryan was on there.### he was being, he was put *-1 in the, which i never knew 0 *t*-2 existed, the restaurant hall of fame.###speakera39.###the restaurant ha-,###speakerb40.###the restaurant hall of fame inducted him tonight,###and he, uh, says 0 he's coming back, you know, uh,###speakera41.###huh.###speakerb42.###he doesn't know how many years i mean, * to pitch *t*-1.###speakera43.###right.###speakerb44.###he'll be at least one more,
124321:36	but, he's, uh, he certainly is a good example, uh, for the kids.	certainly	###speakera47.###and he's still doing great still doing excellent.###speakerb48.###that's right.###speakera49.###speakerb50.###you know, and he said, i get a kick out of it, you know,### he's, he's such a nice man.###speakera51.###well, didn't he just sign a twelve year contract with the rangers?###speakerb52.###yeah,###and he, you know###when he quits at *-1 being active *t*-2, he will go into, you know * being a, managing and, yeah, you know, being a coach, i'm sure 0 *t*-3.###speakera53.###management.###speakerb54.###speakera55.###right.###speakerb56.
124379:45	well, i think 0 it's, it's probably a combination of things.	probably	###his son pitched for u t###speakera71.###well that is neat.###speakerb72.###and, uh, only, uh, ryan didn't want too much publicity on it because he didn't want his son getting too nervous about this whole thing.###speakera73.###uh-huh.###speakerb74.###a game is a game, you know.###well, the rangers really, uh, knocked the socks off of them, which you would expect *t*-1 you know, anyway,###speakera75.###right.###speakerb76.###but nolan i think 0 *t*-2 took himself out after a couple of innings *ich*-1 or something, you know, of the game###so,###speakerb1.###okay.###speakera2.###so what do you, uh, think 0 *t*-1 is the, uh, the worst culprit for air pollution?###speakerb3.
124386:42	and i think 0 that's, that's probably hurting us a little bit.	probably	###speakerb74.###a game is a game, you know.###well, the rangers really, uh, knocked the socks off of them, which you would expect *t*-1 you know, anyway,###speakera75.###right.###speakerb76.###but nolan i think 0 *t*-2 took himself out after a couple of innings *ich*-1 or something, you know, of the game###so,###speakerb1.###okay.###speakera2.###so what do you, uh, think 0 *t*-1 is the, uh, the worst culprit for air pollution?###speakerb3.###well, i think 0 it's, it's probably a combination of things.###um, factories that, that *t*-1 burn coal as a, an energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants, you know,###and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides.###speakera4.###uh-huh.###speakerb5.###uh, those are the ones 0 i think 0 *t*-1 primarily contribute to acid rain,
124455:11	it'd probably be difficult anyway.	probably	###they put a probe in your exhaust pipe### and, and the computer reads whatever the ionization *ich*-2 is *t*-1 coming out,###and so that's, you know, that's the way 0 they're dealing with it here *t*-1.###speakera22.###yeah.###speakerb23.###speakera24.###yeah, uh,###yeah###i guess 0 that was just mainly in the cities there,###and as far as where i live *t*-1, i don't have *-2 to do that,###but i have an old car which i doubt 0 *t*-1 would, uh, would, uh, pass the inspection, a seventy-six,###speakerb25.###yeah.###speakera26.###and, uh, you know, there's no way 0 i would put in a lot of money *-1 to, to repair it * to meet standards *t*-2.###speakerb27.###yeah.###speakera28.###speakerb29.
124490:35	but that, that sounds like that might help *-1 solve that problem even on you know, old, old, uh, older stoves that *t*-2 don't have any kind of e p a requirements on them.	might	### a lot, a lot of people are burning wood,###those of us who *t*-1 have,###i've got a place in the country, you know###speakera36.###uh-huh.###speakerb37.###and, uh, they've had catalytic con-, you know, catalytic converters on those, on,###uh, i think 0 they're required *-1 in california and oregon and, and washington,###but they've had up those for quite a while,###and somebody's come up with a new one that, uh, *t*-1 sort of,### it's a, it's a catalytic converter,### it's, it's a plate that *t*-1 fits in, you know, into the smoke pipe###speakera38.###yeah.###speakerb39.###and, uh, apparently it sort of feeds itself.###the more smoke 0 *t*-2 is produced *-1, you know,###after you get to like five hundred degrees, * the higher 0 it gets *t*-1 the more complete the combustion is *t*-2.###and it sounds real neat.###i haven't seen them priced *-1 anywhere yet,
124494:8	that might help a little bit, especially in some places.	might	###uh-huh.###speakerb37.###and, uh, they've had catalytic con-, you know, catalytic converters on those, on,###uh, i think 0 they're required *-1 in california and oregon and, and washington,###but they've had up those for quite a while,###and somebody's come up with a new one that, uh, *t*-1 sort of,### it's a, it's a catalytic converter,### it's, it's a plate that *t*-1 fits in, you know, into the smoke pipe###speakera38.###yeah.###speakerb39.###and, uh, apparently it sort of feeds itself.###the more smoke 0 *t*-2 is produced *-1, you know,###after you get to like five hundred degrees, * the higher 0 it gets *t*-1 the more complete the combustion is *t*-2.###and it sounds real neat.###i haven't seen them priced *-1 anywhere yet,###but that, that sounds like that might help *-1 solve that problem even on you know, old, old, uh, older stoves that *t*-2 don't have any kind of e p a requirements on them.###speakera40.###yeah.###speakerb41.
124512:20	and in the summer time we probably get yours.	probably	###yeah.###speakerb41.###that might help a little bit, especially in some places.###we're really lucky here.###we have a prevailing southerly wind that *t*-1 blows just about everything out.###speakera42.###yeah.###speakerb43.###now sometimes we get a kind of a,###especially in, in, uh, autumn it seem like we get kind of a brown haze sitting on us,###but most of the time it's blowing out pretty well.###speakera44.###yeah.###speakerb45.###probably blowing up there to you guys.###speakera46.###yeah,###well, well around here i, we get, uh,###well it depends, you know,###either in the, in the winter time it, it blows it your way,
124582:13	but it's probably going *-1 to take me longer, because i didn't decide *-2 to major in that until, uh, about a year and a half after i was already in school,	probably	###oh, really.###speakera11.###yeah.###and you?###speakerb12.###i'm going to b y u,###and i'm going into nursing###speakera13.###okay.###speakerb14.###so.###speakera15.###well, that sounds interesting.###how long of a program is that *t*-1?###speakerb16.###forever.###speakera17.###speakerb18.###* seems like *?*, anyways.###it's about five years,
124731:69	even if you don't have your major decided on *, * have an idea what you think 0 you might want *t*-1, you know,	might	###and i took tons of classes that i didn't need *-2 to *?* *t*-1,###and, um, i don't know,###i just feel like i'm, it's, it's going *-1 to take me a lot longer than,###and not that's always bad,###but it's,###i don't know,###it's frustrating, i guess 0 *t*-1.###speakera63.###well, it, it, it does get it.###you know, you get to the point where it's, i'm never going *-1 to get done *-2 *t*-3.###speakerb64.###right.###speakera65.###you know, i, i mean, i was taking summer classes###and mumblex * let me get out of here.###speakerb66.###yep.###speakera67.###but, uh, no,###that's good advice.
124935:33	and. and, then, uh, maybe we'll talk again.	maybe	###yeah,###that's true,###that's true,### but. so, i guess, uh, 0 we've kind of exhausted this, uh, topic.###speakera72.###yeah,###well, really,### what, what can you.###speakerb73.###yeah,###you can't say too much about it really.###speakera74.###other than, you use them or you don't use them. you like them or you don't like them.###so.###speakerb75.###uh-huh.###speakera76.###i guess, uh, 0 they don't care if we end it early.###so, uh, hopefully, uh, you have a good thanksgiving.###that's coming up,
124987:21	i guess the seville, probably or.	probably	###oh, i guess 0 it's a general motors product,###and i like general motors because they're made *-1 in the united states,###and, uh, we've had general motors for years and have always had real good luck with them.###speakera5.###okay,###well that's good.###speakerb6.###uh-huh.###speakera7.###if you had, uh, no financial requirements, if you could buy any car in the entire world, no matter what it cost *t*-1, what would you buy *t*-2?###speakerb8.###oh, um, i think 0 i'd still go with the cadillac.###speakera9.###do you?###speakerb10.### i don't, i don't care about a big fancy, fancy.###speakera11.###which type of cadillac, uh, is your favorite *t*-1?###speakerb12.###oh, i don't know.
125098:23	we've driven them for about probably twenty years.	probably	###um, i, i go for things, you know, built * in the united states rather than foreign countries.###speakera45.###right.###speakerb46.###* help our economy###and,###speakera47.###what kind of, uh, general motors cars have you had *t*-1 in the past?###speakerb48.###mostly oldsmobiles.###speakera49.###oldsmobiles.###those are real nice riding cars too.###speakerb50.###oh, yeah.###that's what we have *t*-1 now,###but of course if i have a choice i'd still have the cadillac###but, uh, i've been very satisfied with the, with the oldsmobiles.###speakera51.###speakerb52.
125225:49	if we're going *-1 to have national health insurance, which *t*-2 seems likely, it's necessarily going *-3 to involve more taxes.	likely	###speakera97.###speakerb98.###yeah.###speakera99.###so.###speakerb100.###well, i,###yeah,###those are good products also.###um, * let's see,###speakera1.###yes.###um i guess 0 my initial view is 0 our tax burden *ich*-1 hasn't gone down in recent years despite, our total tax burden, despite tax cuts###speakerb2.###uh-huh.###speakera3.###but among industrialized nations we have one of the lowest in, in the world,###and in mumblex###of the matter,###you get what you pay for *t*-1,
125270:47	i think 0 japan, i think 0 japan is probably about equal to ours	probably	###i couldn't.###speakera11.###i think 0 senator moynihan's proposal * to, to cut the social security tax which *t*-1 isn't really going * to, going *-2 to beef up, up, up the social security program could make a lot of sense.###speakerb12.###right,###right.###yeah,###i agree with that.###as far as other countries, i'm not, um, i don't keep up on it too much as to far as what, you know, as what they're do-.###i know###we were in ireland last year###speakera13.###uh-huh.###speakerb14.###and i know that the tax there is extremely high, much higher than we pay here,### but but as far as other countries, i'm not, uh, up to par on.###speakera15.###oh, yeah.###speakerb16.###speakera17.
125325:29	but i, i certainly, certainly have the feeling 0 i've been given *-1 topics different from the ones that i mentioned *t*-2 before.	certainly	###speakera29.###speakerb30.###okay.###speakera31.###speakerb32.###uh-huh.###i was just wondering since you said washington d c,### and you, and you picked this topic,###i was just kind of curious.###speakera33.###well,###well###speakerb34.###speakera35.### i, i, i didn't pick it, uh###speakerb36.###oh, you didn't.###speakera37.###i mean, um, i, like i don't really recall.###i may have filled out on the, on the form,

125395:35	so, um, that's something that i'm probably going *-1 to be looking at *t*-2 maybe in the future.	probably	###and, um, i think 0 it *exp*-1 was really hard * to, um, to pick the right, uh, day care or preschool or mother's day out.###i guess 0 you can classify them all together.###speakerb8.###uh-huh.###speakera9.###um, some of the qualifications that i look for *t*-1 was that, uh, you know, the cost, and, um, exactly what they did *t*-2, if it was structured or nonstructured, if they had a little academic, um, uh, in there, and, um, you know, um, you know, what the qualifications of the teachers' were *t*-3, and if the place was clean and um, the hours###speakerb10.###uh-huh.###speakera11.###and, um, just, just kind of * going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program that kind of stuff.###speakerb12.###right.###speakera13.###speakerb14.###well, we don't have any children,###but we're going *-1 to have one next year.###speakera15.###oh, congratulations.###speakerb16.###thanks.
125395:60	so, um, that's something that i'm probably going *-1 to be looking at *t*-2 maybe in the future.	maybe	###and, um, i think 0 it *exp*-1 was really hard * to, um, to pick the right, uh, day care or preschool or mother's day out.###i guess 0 you can classify them all together.###speakerb8.###uh-huh.###speakera9.###um, some of the qualifications that i look for *t*-1 was that, uh, you know, the cost, and, um, exactly what they did *t*-2, if it was structured or nonstructured, if they had a little academic, um, uh, in there, and, um, you know, um, you know, what the qualifications of the teachers' were *t*-3, and if the place was clean and um, the hours###speakerb10.###uh-huh.###speakera11.###and, um, just, just kind of * going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program that kind of stuff.###speakerb12.###right.###speakera13.###speakerb14.###well, we don't have any children,###but we're going *-1 to have one next year.###speakera15.###oh, congratulations.###speakerb16.###thanks.
125479:22	and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day,	maybe	###speakera43.###that's true.###speakerb44.###and so, it's, i guess 0 it's such a growing concern,###but then there's a lot of good things 0 you don't hear *t*-1.###speakera45.###right.###and sometimes when the child's a lot younger *t*-1, before they're really, um, before three years old, you know, like the church is a good program###and sometimes you even consider, um, you know, *-1 having a private person come to your own home when they're real little *t*-2 or or something like that,###speakerb46.###right.###speakera47.###and another consideration is how many infants or children are they, what's the ratio of, of teachers to to children *t*-1###speakerb48.###to children.###speakera49.###speakerb50.###right.###speakera51.###because that makes, a, a, a difference,
125485:16	you would want, maybe, your child to have their own sheets all the time, and not have another child use that bed you know.	maybe	###right.###and sometimes when the child's a lot younger *t*-1, before they're really, um, before three years old, you know, like the church is a good program###and sometimes you even consider, um, you know, *-1 having a private person come to your own home when they're real little *t*-2 or or something like that,###speakerb46.###right.###speakera47.###and another consideration is how many infants or children are they, what's the ratio of, of teachers to to children *t*-1###speakerb48.###to children.###speakera49.###speakerb50.###right.###speakera51.###because that makes, a, a, a difference,###and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day,###just your child,### and, or do they just put any child in any crib you know,###speakerb52.###uh-huh.###speakera53.
125510:42	but, um, i figure, you know, 0 i'd probably start *-2 asking around at church because i know 0 they have a limit as to how old they can be *t*-1 before they, you know, before you can bring them in.	probably	###right.###speakera57.###i'm sure that, um, whatever you decide *t*-1, you'll be happy with *t*-2.###speakerb58.###yeah.###speakera59.###and it *exp*-1's exciting time * to have a new one.###speakerb60.###yeah.###we're pretty excited.###speakera61.###i bet.### that's, that's wonderful.###speakerb62.###yeah,###but that, you know, we have been thinking about that,###but it's a little ways off in the future###speakera63.###uh-huh.###speakerb64.
125586:10	but then maybe he'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run.	maybe	###but, uh, it's about a thirty minute exercise every morning.###speakera7.###uh-huh,###every morning.###well, my husband swims every day at lunch, which he loves *-1 doing *t*-2###speakerb8.###oh, that would,###that's fantastic exercise.###speakera9.###yeah,###he does it every day like a ritual.###once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if he, um, someone invites him to lunch, he'll, he'll not go,###but he goes, um, every, every day,###and then he ru-, he's a runner, too.###he runs three mornings a week###he gets up about five and, and does his, his deal,###speakerb10.###um.###speakera11.###and some days he doesn't,
125669:17	uh, more than likely, it's going *-1 to be a chrysler.	likely	###well.###speakerb36.###so anyway###speakera37.###okay, well.###speakerb38.###* thank you for *-1 calling.###speakera39.###yes,###* thank you for * participating.###speakerb40.###all right.###speakera41.###* thank you.###bye.###speakerb42.###bye-bye.###speakera1.###well what kind of car, uh, are you thinking of *-2 buying *t*-1 next?###speakerb2.
125969:46	when *-2 teeing off *t*-1 i-, i'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground	probably	###but i don't have enough field.###now i'm t v watching.###speakerb38.###yeah.###speakera39.###they make you die at the hole every time.###speakerb40.###yeah.###speakera41.###oh, it just dies and rolls in.###i don't know,###speakerb42.###but i,###speakera43.###it's hard for me.###speakerb44.### the, the,### it's, it's like i said###once i get up on the green i'm fine,###but that, that tee shot, uh, it, you know,
125991:56	well, it, it, it usually takes me about probably two, two or three *-1 to get it there	probably	###but,###speakera45.###once you're there, you're all set though.###speakerb46.###i'm all set.###speakera47.###we should play team golf then.###speakerb48.###speakera49.###i'll get us there###and you put it in.###speakerb50.###mumblex that sounds good to me.###speakera51.###i s-,###oh, the t v golfers they do that.###it takes them two *-1 to get there and two *-1 to get it in###so it's fifty percent.###and me it takes me five *-1 to get there and five *-1 to get it in.###speakerb52.
125994:15	uh, uh, maybe one or two putts.	maybe	###speakerb46.###i'm all set.###speakera47.###we should play team golf then.###speakerb48.###speakera49.###i'll get us there###and you put it in.###speakerb50.###mumblex that sounds good to me.###speakera51.###i s-,###oh, the t v golfers they do that.###it takes them two *-1 to get there and two *-1 to get it in###so it's fifty percent.###and me it takes me five *-1 to get there and five *-1 to get it in.###speakerb52.###well, it, it, it usually takes me about probably two, two or three *-1 to get it there### and, and then, that's according to the hole###and it ju-,
126023:15	your shitty golf is probably the best golf 0 i've ever seen *t*-1.	probably	### and, and they're really good.###speakera57.###joe pros?###speakerb58.###uh, they're not joe pros###but they, they golf in the high sixties low seventies###so i guess 0 they're pretty good.###speakera59.###that's pretty good.###for eighteen?###speakerb60.###yeah.###for eighteen.###speakera61.###wow,###that's pretty good.###speakerb62.###yeah.###speakera63.###i'm talking to the wrong guy.
126092:36	and, uh, especially with, with possibly children around.	possibly	###speakera12.###i guess 0 in some cases they just consider *-1 pickup your, your phone and, and, and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not.###speakerb13.###uh-huh.###speakera14.###um, but i thought 0 i saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using### and, uh, and, uh, people, businesses would be prohibited *-1, uh, from *-1 calling for pers-, for, for business mumblex selling you things.###speakerb15.###i have through, the phone company, uh,###speakera16.###i'm sure 0 that's true.###speakerb17.###no nine hundred numbers can be dialed *-1 from my phone or received *-1.###speakera18.###uh, some of mumblex did too.### i think, i think 0 government can do that now,###is that right?###speakerb19.###uh-huh.###speakera20.
126274:18	i think 0 it might be good for them.	might	###speakera21.###i never had *-1 to make one.###they just always came.###speakerb22.###yeah.###exactly.###speakera23.###people must be tired of it or something.###speakerb24.###speakera25.### w-, well anyway i guess 0 we're supposed *-1 to discuss this, uh, subject,###what do you think *t*-1?.###speakerb26.###well, i never gave it any thought myself.###speakera27.###speakerb28.###i was hoping 0 you could tell me what you thought *t*-1.###speakera29.###oh.###well, i don't have any objection to people doing that.

126312:26	well it, it probably won't *?*.	probably	###speakerb38.###yeah,###yeah.###speakera39.###that, that would be my main objection.###uh, i don't think,###speakerb40.###uh-huh.###i don't know###i think 0 maybe it's, it should stay on a voluntary basis.###speakera41.###it will probably never happen###but,###speakerb42.###yeah.###yeah,### i, i think 0 it *exp*-1 would be good for, uh, everyone to do something like that###but i, i guess 0 i don't feel like it should be something forced * upon you.###speakera43.###yeah,
126330:8	it might be a real eye opener, you know.	might	###speakera43.###yeah,###well it, it probably won't *?*.###speakerb44.###uh-huh.###speakera45.### i don't, i don't even know how we'd pay for it *t*-1 anyway.###we can't, uh seem *-1 to pay for all the little things 0 we have *t*-2 going now.###speakerb46.###uh-huh.###speakera47.###speakerb48.###uh-huh.###speakera49.###that's another consideration.###speakerb50.###exactly.###speakera51.###but, uh, i don't know### som-, some kids are so spoiled nowadays
126342:8	i probably lived in one of those when i was a little girl *t*-1.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakera49.###that's another consideration.###speakerb50.###exactly.###speakera51.###but, uh, i don't know### som-, some kids are so spoiled nowadays###it might be a real eye opener, you know.###speakerb52.###really.###speakera53.###i mean, sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here###and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes###and then they think,###they're just kind of shocked at that side of town, you know.###speakerb54.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###speakera55.
126377:59	i'm just sitting at home and, and, uh, doing laundry today and certainly not up,	certainly	###sometimes i wish 0 we'd help them out instead of *-1 going all across the world, and helping some countries 0 i never even heard of *t*-2.###speakerb62.###uh-huh.###speakera63.###speakerb64.###uh-huh.###i know it.###speakera65.###it seems to me 0 we are,###it *exp*-1 would be to our benefit * to strengthen that country. right on our borders.###speakerb66.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera67.###speakerb68.###uh-huh.###speakera69.###but, what do i know *t*-1, right?.###speakerb70.###speakera71.
126413:8	patty might *?*.	might	###i just went by that place.###we were going to a football playoff game *ich*-2 a week or so ago which we lost *t*-1###and, uh, we went by.###speakerb80.###speakera81.###that's the first time 0 i'd seen it *t*-1.###it looked really nice.###speakerb82.###yeah.###speakera83.###a lot of trees there.###it looked like a pretty little, a sight.###speakerb84.###* hang on a minute.###speakera85.###sure.###speakerb86.###no,###i don't think so,###yeah,
126477:26	i don't know if they could possibly teach a machine *-1 to recognize all the different accents.	possibly	###right.###speakerb106.###like maryland, and new jersey,###speakera107.###uh-huh.###speakerb108.### and but now it just seems like it's in the dallas fort worth area that i get calls from *t*-1.###speakera109.###yeah,###i've had the same experiences,###speakerb110.###uh-huh.###speakera111.###all right around here.###speakerb112.###uh-huh.###speakera113.###yeah,###i don't know, uh,###i wonder if they really,
126538:8	she might *?*.	might	###speakera131.###right.###speakerb132.###speakera133.###well, do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject?.###speakerb134.###no,###i sure don't.###speakera135.###you don't have any kids 0 you want *-1 to send *t*-2 over here?.###speakerb136.###no,###no kids.###speakera137.###well, mumblex is.###speakerb138.###oh, shoot.###speakera139.###well, uh, i don't know if mine would want *-1 to go *-2 live in the ghetto.###well, one of them is real idealistic,
126630:19	we've seen that movie probably six times in the last six months.	probably	###speakerb22.###um, gene hackman's a good actor. i think 0 *t*-1.###speakera23.###yes,###he is *?*.###speakerb24.###do you see hoosiers?###speakera25.###yes.###i've seen hoosiers.###* saw it just again the other night, for,###speakerb26.###yeah,###actually i, we saw her just the other night too.###speakera27.###oh, did you?###speakerb28.###yeah.###it's one of our favorite movies.### i, i live with, um, a roommate and my girlfriend the three of us.
126822:9	but, probably once a month or so, there was some reason that i would have *-1 to put on a suit *t*-2. for a customer presentation or something.	probably	###so, does it change?###speakerb26.###no.###speakera27.###your dress,###no.###speakerb28.###no,###huh-uh.###speakera29.### so, or, i guess,###do you have things like presentations *ich*-3 0 *-1 to do *t*-2 or anything like that?###speakerb30.###no,###huh-uh.###speakera31.###so, back in my old job, up until through nineteen eighty i would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like,###speakerb32.###uh-huh.###speakera33.
127030:18	uh, so there were probably really fight *-1 to keep it in if they could *?*.	probably	###i know 0 a lot of their, oh, their countries that they had overtaken *t*-1 *ich*-3, or wanted *-2 to be independent or several of them, right,###speakerb25.###yeah.###speakera26.###and, uh, what about astonia,###are they,###speakerb27.###they're completely out now.###speakera28.###right,###i thought 0 they were *?*.###speakerb29.###yes,### the three, the three baltic, uh, republics got out as quickly as they could *?*.###speakera30.### but, but, the, the ukraine is especially significant because it, of the agriculture?###speakerb31.###right,### it's, it's very important for the economics of the whole, of the soviet union.###speakera32.
127104:20	i think 0 maybe they, uh, maybe they contributed to it.	maybe	### i, i know that we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and that other countries put a lot of restrictions that we don't *t*-1###speakerb53.###yeah.###speakera54.###and so i assume that that has some effect. or a great effect.###speakerb55.###yeah.###speakera56.###speakerb57.###uh-huh.###speakera58.###and i do, uh, i mean, they said 0 during the way, reagan-bush years, the rich got richer,###the poor got poorer,###the statistics prove that###so, uh, i, i guess,###speakerb59.###so then, you think 0 it's, it's, you think 0 it's reagan and bush 0 *t*-1 have done this###or is it *exp*-1 just coincidence 0 it was during this period?###speakera60.###well, i really don't know.
127104:36	i think 0 maybe they, uh, maybe they contributed to it.	maybe	### i, i know that we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and that other countries put a lot of restrictions that we don't *t*-1###speakerb53.###yeah.###speakera54.###and so i assume that that has some effect. or a great effect.###speakerb55.###yeah.###speakera56.###speakerb57.###uh-huh.###speakera58.###and i do, uh, i mean, they said 0 during the way, reagan-bush years, the rich got richer,###the poor got poorer,###the statistics prove that###so, uh, i, i guess,###speakerb59.###so then, you think 0 it's, it's, you think 0 it's reagan and bush 0 *t*-1 have done this###or is it *exp*-1 just coincidence 0 it was during this period?###speakera60.###well, i really don't know.
127166:45	but she's, uh, n-, you know, probably more popular *ich*-1 out of the state than she is *?* here, although she did manage *-2 to win.	probably	###oh, i know,###it used *-1 to *?*,###right.###well, you don't want too many democrats anymore###and for a while i kind of deserted the party,###but now it's looking better to me.###speakerb79.###i like your governor.###speakera80.###oh, do you?###oh, i'm glad *-1 to hear that.###speakerb81.###she's an impressive woman.###speakera82.###well, i think so, too.### i, i just, admire her a lot.###speakerb83.###yeah.###speakera84.###and, uh, i ho-, i really hope 0 she does well.
127527:31	so that's why i thought 0 i might be interested in it *t*-1,	might	###speakera50.###it's entertaining, you know,###and, uh, that's,### i just, i enjoy it,### i, you know, i, uh.###well, that entertainment is, is very,### wasn't that similar, or isn't it similar to, to the tv guide?###speakerb51.###uh,, no,###not really.###i mean, not the one 0 i take *t*-1 now.### it's a, it's a magazine###and it goes into all the movies, *-1 previewing the movies that *t*-2 are going *-3 to be released *-4 or behind the scenes.###speakera52.###oh, uh-huh.###speakerb53.###speakera54.###oh, i see.###speakerb55.###and, uh, i'm a real movie buff,

128373:41	i'm thinking what, what problems my children might have *t*-1 in that, uh,	might	###oh, okay, uh,###speakera15.###i guess 0 one clear-cut piece of advice is by all means * visit the college campus.###speakerb16.###yes.###speakera17.###* uh, stay in a dormitory if you can *?*.###* go to classes,###* talk to faculty members and students.###speakerb18.###yes,###and also, uh, depending on how, uh, uh, adjustable *ich*-2 your child would be *t*-1, or, or flexible, i guess 0 it would be *?*, uh,### if, if they chose a college in a different part of the country that maybe the, they were unused to their, that, the way 0 *t*-1 they run things *t*-2,###i mean, the, the northern colleges are very different than the southern colleges, i think 0 *t*-1.###the people are different###and, uh, you have *-1 to be more flexible and more willing *-2 to, uh, uh, adjust to other people's mannerisms and customs or ways of * doing things.###you know, you have *-1 to be a flexible person *-2 to be able *-3 to go all the way across country to something totally different than what you're used to *t*-4.###uh,###speakera19.###yes,
128388:41	if they're used to the northern weather then the southern weather they might kind of feel like they need *-1 to go out and play all the time, not be in *-2 studying. if you're in florida or california.	might	###and, uh, you have *-1 to be more flexible and more willing *-2 to, uh, uh, adjust to other people's mannerisms and customs or ways of * doing things.###you know, you have *-1 to be a flexible person *-2 to be able *-3 to go all the way across country to something totally different than what you're used to *t*-4.###uh,###speakera19.###yes,###i'm thinking what, what problems my children might have *t*-1 in that, uh,###speakerb20.###you think so?###speakera21.###but i agree with you.###speakerb22.###uh, * let's see,###what else.###uh, well, climate would be, you know,###you'd have *-1 to###speakera23.###uh-huh.###speakerb24.###you know, is somewhat,### if, uh, if it's something different than the one 0 they're used to *t*-1, i guess, uh,
128413:10	and also maybe then the parents could pay a third	maybe	###speakera27.###yeah.###speakerb28.###speakera29.###well, course mumblex it, it is a big factor in * having an understanding of how much parents will pay *t*-3 and how much *t*-1 has *-2 to come from other sources and your willingness, one, * to, to work during the summer or, or part time. and two, uh, * to, to take out loans to assume, uh, debt after college.###speakerb30.###that's right.###speakera31.###speakerb32.###there's,###speakera33.###speakerb34.### the, the responsibility of that.###and, uh, uh, uh, they could, they could work and earn money towards college.###also if they stay within their state, you get a lot more financial aid###or it's a lot cheaper *ich*-1 if you stay within your state than if you go out of state to a private school, uh,###speakera35.###yes.###speakerb36.###and, like i said, if they was willing *-1 to work, uh, in the summers

128430:13	my son is certainly not persuaded *-1 of that.	certainly	###yes.###speakerb36.###and, like i said, if they was willing *-1 to work, uh, in the summers###and also maybe then the parents could pay a third###and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is *t*-1.###by the time,###i have an eleven year old 0 *t*-1 is my oldest,###so, it's not too far away,###but it's,###speakera37.###mine is twelve.###speakerb38.###oh, okay.###but it's getting there,###i mean, we still have, definitely can put away the money for college now.###uh, i would advise that, that they did not have a car at college.###they would,###speakera39.###that's my gut feeling, too.###i,
128528:50	uh, except that the rumor is, is that they still might *?*,	might	###no,###it's just the old guys still.###speakerb21.###yeah,###it *exp*-1 was just a rumor that that would happen this time.###however, the rumor is, is that it will happen next, happen next time###so,###speakera22.###you know, that i read in people or somewhere, no, it was u s a today###speakerb23.###uh-huh.###speakera24.###that they said 0 they weren't going *-1 to do anymore.###that was it.###speakerb25.###uh-huh.###speakera26.###but,###speakerb27.###yeah,
128682:16	uh, it's definitely a lot better. a lot more realistic really.	definitely	###but it was, it was saying * don't do star trek management style.###and they were referring to, you know, captain kirk,###every time 0 he left the enterprise *t*-1, everything went to hell.###speakera82.###oh.###speakerb83.###and nothing got righted *-1 until he got back up on the ship.###speakera84.###right,###so he kind of was a cowboy type, too.###speakerb85.###uh-huh###speakera86.###* made all the decisions###but, uh, jean luke does more of a, a, committee type of management.###speakerb87.###speakera88.###speakerb89.###uh-huh,###yeah,
128792:11	durham has probably got the worst.	probably	###speakera14.###right,###research triangle and all of that.###speakerb15.###right.###speakera16.###and, uh, i'm sure 0 you have a lot of students there, uh, and a lot of researchers###so you, you may have a, you know, perhaps a little better economic climate,###but, in all your cities now, it seems like th-, there is a, a crowd that *t*-1's really effected *-2 by this bill.###speakerb17.###yeah,### it's, it's really, it's,###and i've seen in more *ich*-1 in durham than i have *?* in raleigh or, or or chapel hill.###speakera18.###really?###speakerb19.###chapel hill is kind of a, a ritzy city or whatever.###i mean, it's kind of,### i'm, i'm sure 0 there is problems with it,###but it has a pretty low crime rate. compare, compared to, to,
128854:45	i, i'm, i'm probably the, one of the youngest people that *t*-1 live over here.	probably	###they just thought 0 she was moving.###it was 0 a moving man pulled right up to her house, broke in and stole everything 0 she owned *t*-1.###speakera32.###boy that really, that really takes someone who *t*-1 is bold * to do that.###speakerb33.###well, yeah,### it's, it's, it's pretty bad.###speakera34.###well, now, do you find that security is very good in, in a, in a town home?###speakerb35.###uh, i would say so for the majority in, in our, in my little section of the neighborhood because there is always somebody at home###speakera36.###uh-huh.###speakerb37.###and we all know one another### and, and, on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we're not moving and different things like that.###speakera38.###well, that,###speakerb39.###it's,
128884:69	one, one thing that *t*-2 effects us is 0 we have apartments that *t*-1 are probably about a half mile away	probably	###yeah.###speakerb43.###so i really don't worry about anything.###speakera44.###well, i think 0 you hit on one point *ich*-2 there 0 *t*-1 is 0 you know each other.###speakerb45.###yeah.###speakera46.### i'm, i'm in a neighborhood where we try *-1 to keep up with everything *t*-2.###uh, i am, oh, about three blocks off a major road and, uh, a couple of blocks off another road that *t*-1 kind of runs,###i guess 0 you would say 0 the neighborhood road, it runs between the high school and the, the commercial districts###and, uh, i'm over the northeast part of dallas.###it's a, in a nice neighborhood.###the houses here, uh, before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so###and, course, everything's down ten to twenty percent now.###speakerb47.###yeah,###see, that's the same thing here.###speakera48.###but we have, uh,
129051:46	it's got *-1 to be like, it's probably fifty, fifty-five, maybe.	probably	###well, not flat, but hilly.###but no big mountains or anything.###speakera47.###uh-huh.###so you just moved away a year ago?###speakerb48.###uh, in august.###speakera49.###wow, really recent.###speakerb50.###yeah.###but, uh, see, see what else can i say *t*-1 about the weather.###uh,, well, today was warmer.###it was like forty-five.###speakera51.###oh, warm.###speakerb52.###so, what's the temperature *t*-1 up today over there?###speakera53.###oh, man,

129186:42	i think 0 she graduated around then, too, though, eighty-seven probably,	probably	###speakerb102.###uh, education.###i got a double major.###speakera103.###in,###speakerb104.###uh, elementary and special ed.###speakera105.###really?###speakerb106.###uh-huh.###speakera107.###that what my sister did *t*-1.###speakerb108.###oh, really?###speakera109.###yeah,###you might know her.###here name is lori, bird.###maybe not.
129241:11	they are probably still in deliberations on it.	probably	###which *t*-1 is funny because i got called *-2 last night and the topic was, uh, something about juries.###speakera9.###oh, really?###speakerb10.###yeah,###so i am just hitting it right.###uh, how do i feel about it *t*-1?### i, i don't know.###well, i guess 0 it is right in certain cases.###uh,###speakera11.###yeah.###speakerb12.###becau-,###well, the one 0 i was just on *t*-1, i don't,###i was an alternate on the case,###so i don't know what *t*-1 was decided *-2.###speakera13.###right.###speakerb14.
129518:32	steamed she-, uh, shellfish with maybe herbs.	maybe	###speakerb116.###that's right.###speakera117.###but i guess, just * going up there and seeing the surroundings and stuff, the people up there,###speakerb1.###now is it stacy?###speakera2.###angie.###speakerb3.###angie,###i'm sorry.###speakera4.###okay.###speakerb5.###well, now, so if you were going *-1 to have a dinner party, what would you make *t*-2?###speakera6.###um, * let's see,###uh, i like seafood.###uh, * let's see,###uh, shrimp,
129591:12	so, we might have some cocktails *ich*-1 ahead of time and maybe some, uh, some dip, uh, some cheese.	might	### and, and then, uh, uh, dessert.###speakera30.###i'm not really a drinker,###so i'm not, i don't know a lot about that.###speakerb31.###something sweet?###speakera32.###oh, goodness.###uh, chocolate, something chocolate.###uh,###speakerb33.###you must like chocolate.###speakera34.###yes.###speakerb35.###well, * let's see.###usually when we have a dinner party *t*-1, i always, i like *-2 to grill.###speakera36.###oh, you do?###speakerb37.
129591:39	so, we might have some cocktails *ich*-1 ahead of time and maybe some, uh, some dip, uh, some cheese.	maybe	### and, and then, uh, uh, dessert.###speakera30.###i'm not really a drinker,###so i'm not, i don't know a lot about that.###speakerb31.###something sweet?###speakera32.###oh, goodness.###uh, chocolate, something chocolate.###uh,###speakerb33.###you must like chocolate.###speakera34.###yes.###speakerb35.###well, * let's see.###usually when we have a dinner party *t*-1, i always, i like *-2 to grill.###speakera36.###oh, you do?###speakerb37.
129612:68	but that's, i guess 0 when you talk about dinner party *t*-2, that's probably not, uh, that's more for like when friends come over *t*-1.	probably	###one of our favorites is, uh, * to take some, * let's see philadelphia cream cheese i think, is that what *t*-1 comes in those little blocks? and pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp and, uh, wash them and cool them and then dump them in the, uh, sauce and then take crackers###speakera38.###uh-huh.###speakerb39.###speakera40.###yeah.###speakerb41.###and then you just dip the cracker in the sauce with the clams and the cream cheese###and you have a real nice dip that *t*-1 goes good with a cocktail.###and then i like *-1 to barbecue, like steaks or pork chops.###and then we have, uh, s-, oh, lot of times we'll have baked potatoes *ich*-1 with them and a salad###speakera42.###uh-huh.###speakerb43.###and then, uh, i don't know what we usually have *t*-1 for dessert.###cake sometimes,###but, uh, that's what we would do *t*-1 for a dinner party, i guess 0 *t*-2.###speakera44.###that sounds good, too.###speakerb45.
129670:56	um, and he's not interested in *-1 letting his twenty-one year old daughter experiment with it probably.	probably	###okay,###all right.###so you graduated from which high school?###speakera64.###trinity.###speakerb65.###trinity,###okay.###and that's a public school or private?###speakera66.###that's public.###speakerb67.###huh, okay,###i have *-1 to get *-2 to know this area a little better, i guess 0 *t*-3.###uh, well, is your father's cafe, uh, one that you could cater out of *t*-1?###speakera68.###no,###uh-huh,###it's not *?*.###speakerb69.
129875:27	but i think 0 the city one could possibly look into that or something.	possibly	###speakerb76.###and they don't take,###speakera77.###* probably going *-1 to throw them in your trash.###speakerb78.###yeah,###that's what *t*-1 happens###because,###speakera79.###well, there are places that *t*-1 take car batteries,###but i wonder if they would take,###speakerb80.###yeah.###speakera81.###i mean, not that it would,###kind of a pain * to, you know, drive over somewhere special just for that, for two little tiny batteries###but,###speakerb82.###yeah,###yeah,

130764:15	well, shoot, maybe what we ought *-1 to do *t*-2 is *-1 start *-3 sending unsmashed, uh, pepsi cans and whatever up there.	maybe	###yeah.###speakera38.###but, uh, they have sort of like, uh, things that you c-, you're not like reimbursed for *t*-1 or paid for *t*-1.###like we can recycle, uh, clear glass, brown glass, green glass. uh, and milk jugs and, uh, newspapers, you know,###speakerb39.###yeah.###speakera40.###everyone does newspapers.###speakerb41.###yeah,###yeah,###everybody does newspapers.###speakera42.###but, that, that kind of stuff.###speakerb43.###yeah.###speakera44.###but they, they said 0 they can't be smashed or else, uh, it doesn't fit in their little containers###and they're not reimbursed *-1 by the, the people who *t*-2 are over them or something.###speakerb45.
130789:74	but if it's going *-1 to cost you *-2 to take care of the environment, they're not quite as, uh likely *-3 to do it as if, uh, if you get something back for it. you know.	likely	###exactly,###yeah,###* send it to this address,###no.###speakerb49.###speakera50.###but, uh, * let's see,###they said that, how, ways, 0 can encourage recycling, uh,###speakerb51.### i, i, i tell you### what, what *t*-1 really works, uh, at least down here is, if there is, if there is some, e-, even some money 0 * basically to take care of the gas 0 * to recycle it *t*-4 *t*-5, you know what i mean *t*-2, then people tend *-3 to do it.###uh,###speakera52.###yeah,###that's,###speakerb53.###in other words, * taking care of the environment is, is all well and good###speakera54.###uh-huh.###speakerb55.
130791:6	as likely * to do it.	likely	###* send it to this address,###no.###speakerb49.###speakera50.###but, uh, * let's see,###they said that, how, ways, 0 can encourage recycling, uh,###speakerb51.### i, i, i tell you### what, what *t*-1 really works, uh, at least down here is, if there is, if there is some, e-, even some money 0 * basically to take care of the gas 0 * to recycle it *t*-4 *t*-5, you know what i mean *t*-2, then people tend *-3 to do it.###uh,###speakera52.###yeah,###that's,###speakerb53.###in other words, * taking care of the environment is, is all well and good###speakera54.###uh-huh.###speakerb55.###but if it's going *-1 to cost you *-2 to take care of the environment, they're not quite as, uh likely *-3 to do it as if, uh, if you get something back for it. you know.###speakera56.
130809:36	if it costs them something, then they're not as likely *-1 to use it.	likely	###but if it's going *-1 to cost you *-2 to take care of the environment, they're not quite as, uh likely *-3 to do it as if, uh, if you get something back for it. you know.###speakera56.###as likely * to do it.###speakerb57.###speakera58.###yeah.###speakerb59.###speakera60.###yeah,###that's true.###speakerb61.### and, uh, so, you know, if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings, anything that they can pass *t*-1 on to the consumer, you know,###it kind of reminds me of *-2 using an a t m card, you know, *-3 to get money or * doing your banking.###speakera62.###uh-huh.###speakerb63.###speakera64.###yeah.###speakerb65.###you know, if it's free, people will use it,
130890:8	you probably have enjoyed *-1 getting away from the snow.	probably	###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###but, uh, have you always lived here in dallas###and,###speakera11.###no,###i've lived here for almost five years now.###speakerb12.###i see.###speakera13.###and i'm a, uh,###before that i was at school in rochester, new york###and i'm originally from boston.###speakerb14.###oh, well, you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood.###speakera15.###that's right,###but i like it.###speakerb16.
130925:23	i, i probably do know,	probably	###speakerb22.###around in texas###and, uh, i have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it.###speakera23.###uh-huh.###speakerb24.###but, uh, i don't know,###i'm not sure 0 i would want *-1 to take on those winters.###i'm getting older and, uh, not sure that's something 0 i want *-1 to do *t*-2.###speakera25.###i know.###speakerb26.###speakera27.###speakerb28.###i live, uh, over in the lake highlands area if you're familiar with that.###speakera29.###uh, * tell me where that is *t*-1, uh,###speakerb30.###okay.###speakera31.
130948:59	so, uh my particular area, the homes run anywhere from about sixty-five, eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million.	probably	###speakera33.###but i don't know it by that name.###speakerb34.###this is pretty well where l b j and audelia, skillman cross *t*-1.###speakera35.###okay.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###sure.###speakerb38.###we're just north of, uh, white rock lake.###speakera39.###oh, okay,###yeah,###i know that area.###that's a nice area.###speakerb40.###well, we have some very nice hou-, homes here in this area.###uh, my particular,###i guess 0 they want us to describe the area,
130974:47	i mean, we've got houses two streets away that *t*-1 are probably around seventy, eighty thousand	probably	###yes,###uh, the homes that *t*-1 were here earlier were smaller.###now they've gotten larger and larger as, as they have developed the land.###and, of course, it's pretty static right now###and all the values over here have dropped off because of the economy.###speakera45.###uh-huh,###yeah.###speakerb46.###how about you?###speakera47.###well, i am, uh, i'm, gosh, i'm barely in dallas.###i'm just north of addison airport up on the tollway.###speakerb48.###okay.###speakera49.###speakerb50.###okay.###speakera51.###and, i guess 0 we have a similar situation.
131049:13	and this was definitely not a fix up special,	definitely	###was it damaged *-1?###speakera73.###yes,###no,###the only thing that we were worried about *t*-1 was the air conditioner because they'd have it just running constantly with the doors and windows open.###speakerb74.###oh, it was *?*?###speakera75.###but,###yeah.###speakerb76.###oh.###speakera77.###so we just, you know, we bargained *-1 to get an extra warrantee on that.###speakerb78.###i see.###speakera79.###and, uh, we're really, we haven't had any problems###and, you know, we had originally thought 0 we'd have *-1 to get a fix up special or something because *-2 being from the northeast we figured 0 we couldn't afford anything.###but the prices are much lower here
131087:13	and that's probably going *-1 to increase. you know.	probably	###but before they had it, i found out after i had been in the house, it, it had sat * empty for the better part of a year.###speakera87.###uh-huh.###speakerb88.###and i'm not sure what *t*-1 happened,###but i do know 0 the folks that we bought it from *t*-1 had done virtually no maintenance for, for about four years.###speakera89.###oh, no.###speakerb90.### i, i, i found a lot of things,###but,###speakera1.###we're set.###speakerb2.###okay.###speakera3.###what changes do you feel 0 *t*-1 have happened?###speakerb4.###oh, i guess 0 the first thing has been the, uh, for the right, for women to vote.###i think 0 that *ich*-1 has been a major change and also the fact that, uh, there are so mu-, many more women *ich*-2 in the work force nowadays than there were *?*
131122:8	it definitely has changed.	definitely	###well, and i think 0 women have kind of had, uh, in the past the real subservient role.###speakerb12.###role?###speakera13.###speakerb14.###right.###speakera15.###and, uh,###speakerb16.###that's changing.###speakera17.###well, we do to some degree###speakerb18.###right.###speakera19.###but, uh, uh, i think 0 it's not as much as it was *?*.###speakerb20.###right,###yeah,### i, i agree.
131192:21	i think that we're probably going *-1 to see a lot more companies, uh, run * by females.	probably	###yeah###it is *?*.###speakerb44.###i mean, you got *-1 to take the time off.###speakera45.###you have *-1 to save all of your, uh, vacation time.###speakerb46.###speakera47.###you do.###you have *-1 to save all your vacation time###and that's usually how it's, uh, happened *t*-1,###speakerb48.###yeah.###speakera49.###but, uh,###speakerb50.###uh-huh.###speakera51.###what do you see, uh, *t*-1 changing in the future?###speakerb52.
131208:7	and probably, uh, we'll see more females in political roles.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakera51.###what do you see, uh, *t*-1 changing in the future?###speakerb52.###i think that we're probably going *-1 to see a lot more companies, uh, run * by females.###speakera53.###right,### and, and top level.###speakerb54.###and we'll prob-,###speakera55.###speakerb56.###i'm sorry?###speakera57.###maybe top level.###speakerb58.###right,###right,###upper management,###more women in upper management
131220:42	and, uh, so i think 0 we're probably going *-1 to see more of that in the future.	probably	###i'm sorry?###speakera57.###maybe top level.###speakerb58.###right,###right,###upper management,###more women in upper management###and probably, uh, we'll see more females in political roles.###more governors and, i think, you know, roles like that.###speakera59.###that would be kind of nice.###speakerb60.###well, we've got, in texas, we have a female governor.###speakera61.###that's right,###that's right.###speakerb62.###and we had a female mayor here in dallas,###and she just, her term just ended
131225:21	i think 0 that's probably good.	probably	###right,###upper management,###more women in upper management###and probably, uh, we'll see more females in political roles.###more governors and, i think, you know, roles like that.###speakera59.###that would be kind of nice.###speakerb60.###well, we've got, in texas, we have a female governor.###speakera61.###that's right,###that's right.###speakerb62.###and we had a female mayor here in dallas,###and she just, her term just ended### and, uh, so i think 0 we're probably going *-1 to see more of that in the future.###speakera63.###yeah###speakerb64.###speakera65.
131230:14	and, uh, maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners	maybe	###speakera59.###that would be kind of nice.###speakerb60.###well, we've got, in texas, we have a female governor.###speakera61.###that's right,###that's right.###speakerb62.###and we had a female mayor here in dallas,###and she just, her term just ended### and, uh, so i think 0 we're probably going *-1 to see more of that in the future.###speakera63.###yeah###speakerb64.###speakera65.###i think 0 that's probably good.###a little more integration.###speakerb66.###uh-huh.###speakera67.
131271:13	and they're probably,	probably	###i don't either.###speakerb76.###speakera77.###i don't think 0 they're ever going *-1 to prove that men and women are equal.###speakerb78.###yeah.###speakera79.###we just function differently.###speakerb80.###right,###right.###speakera81.###and, uh, i'm not capable of *-2 lifting what, uh, a man can lift *t*-1 and you know, that type of, that type of thing,###speakerb82.###yeah.###speakera83.###but, uh one of the big changes, uh, 0 they're doing *t*-1 in salt lake is, uh,###speakerb84.###right.###speakera85.
131303:17	and some ways, it might be kind of scary.	might	###speakera89.###right.###speakerb90.###yeah,###uh, i think 0 it's wonderful.###speakera91.###right.###you only have *-1 to check in with the office once or twice a week###and,###speakerb92.###yeah.###speakera93.###course, they're talking about, uh, that we're going *-1 to be able *-2 to do our grocery shopping and banking and everything like that,###speakerb94.###oh, i kn-,###speakera95.###speakerb96.###by the phone and all that.###speakera97.###so, uh, it *exp*-1 would be kind of exciting in some ways * to, to see a little bit more of that
131529:13	well, i certainly hope so.	certainly	###my goodness.### are they, are those two married?###speakerb82.###no.###speakera83.###they, uh, just working up there or going to school or what?###speakerb84.###well, uh, * let's see,###yeah,###i guess 0 you'd say 0 j r is working, going to s-, trying * to go to school.###speakera85.###uh-huh.###speakerb86.###i wish to god 0 he would go back.###speakera87.###oh, they do. especially if they, if they're meant *-1 to *?*, i think 0 *t*-2.###speakerb88.###yeah.###speakera89.###speakerb90.
131749:8	i probably need *-1 to take some, some more lessons, uh, more current and, uh, and practice more often.	probably	###but, uh i just, i just never could do it.###speakerb26.###speakera27.###i have a brother-in-law who *t*-1 is, uh, an ex-college coach and like a pro###and he has a very good handicap and plays good golf###sort of like the non golfer golfer of the family.###speakerb28.###well, i went to,###i decided this past year that i was going *-1 to get out and start *-2 playing a lot more###and i, i went after it###and did, and i really didn't find much improvement.###fact, ever time 0 i'd start *-1 trying *-2 to correct something *t*-3, it seemed like the score would go, go back up,###speakera29.###oh, really?###speakerb30.###yeah,### i, i think 0 i need *-1 to, uh,###speakera31.###yeah.###speakerb32.
131755:21	i think 0 i'm probably the same way.	probably	###speakerb28.###well, i went to,###i decided this past year that i was going *-1 to get out and start *-2 playing a lot more###and i, i went after it###and did, and i really didn't find much improvement.###fact, ever time 0 i'd start *-1 trying *-2 to correct something *t*-3, it seemed like the score would go, go back up,###speakera29.###oh, really?###speakerb30.###yeah,### i, i think 0 i need *-1 to, uh,###speakera31.###yeah.###speakerb32.###i probably need *-1 to take some, some more lessons, uh, more current and, uh, and practice more often.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###spend more time on the,###speakera35.
131982:4	definitely.	definitely	###speakerb23.###and i did the, i, i did one that *t*-1 was, the demonstration of a touch, touch screen for a company that *t*-2 sells, uh, touch screens.###it was kind of fun.###speakera24.###uh-huh,###speakerb25.###* put a little bitty portable computer *ich*-1 in there and a plasma display. and make it look like things like, uh, you know, attack simulators and mumblex, and all sorts of little things 0 you'd want *-2 to put your finger on the screen for *t*-3.###speakera26.###huh.###speakerb27.###speakera28.###well, that's,###speakerb29.###speakera30.###well, that sounds interesting.###speakerb31.###speakera32.###matter of fact, uh, i guess 0 you do, uh, you get a lot of graphics in there, i imagine, huh.###speakerb33.###oh, yeah,
132138:22	that wasn't alive for but maybe two years.	maybe	###i tell you, those prices have just, unbelievably come down.###speakerb93.###uh-huh,###oh, yeah,###i was amazed 0 i was able *-1 to get this four eighty-six for six hundred even with a trade in,###you know, it's like, wow.###speakera94.###yeah.###speakerb95.###that works,###i'll go *-1 do that.###speakera96.###i,###speakerb97.###and boy that thing screams now.###speakera98.###yeah,###i was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed, the three eighty-six *t*-1.###speakerb99.###speakera100.

132425:103	but, you know by the time 0 i get over the gym and, and go for my class and shower and get back to work *t*-1, it is probably two hours or more	probably	###but it has always had *-1 to be late at night after i have got home and after dinner###speakera50.###yeah.###speakerb51.###and you are just kind of going ugh.###speakera52.###speakerb53.###and i have tried it immediately after school###like, * try *-1 to get some place and exercise from five to six,###but then by the time 0 you get home and you get dinner *t*-1 you are eating so late.###speakera54.###that is right.###that is right.###that is a mumblex.###speakerb55.###it is *?*.###it is really hard with our life style when you work *t*-1 to,###speakera56.###uh-huh.###well, i know, 0 some people go during lunch,
132511:33	and it's, it's probably about a hundred and fifty dollars a year. which *t*-1 is bad.	probably	###speakerb85.###and at first we used it###and then it got where we weren't beginning *-1 to get out money's worth *t*-2.###speakera86.###yeah.###speakerb87.###and they offered lots of things,###but we weren't taking advantage of them because we didn't have the time *-1 to *?*.###speakera88.###yeah.###speakerb89.###so we decided *-1 to forget that.###speakera90.###uh-huh.###speakerb91.###that was just a waste of our our money.###speakera92.###yeah.###yeah.###well we have one through work
132533:24	but he decided that, uh, maybe, uh, you know,	maybe	###oh no.###speakera94.###but, i, uh, i don't know###i still just don't don't end up *-1 going cause it isn't at a convenient time or i don't know something,###but i need *-1 to do something. if, if it's only * walk the dog or something.###speakerb95.###uh-huh.###speakera96.###i need *-1 to start *-2 doing that.###speakerb97.###it does make you feel better.###the hard thing is * getting *-1 going.###speakera98.###that is right.###speakerb99.###and if you have somebody who *t*-1 will do it with you,###like, for a long time my husband didn't want *-1 to walk cause he wants *-2 to, uh, jog###speakera100.###uh-huh.###speakerb101.
132543:16	well, that's probably the next year's agenda.	probably	###it does make you feel better.###the hard thing is * getting *-1 going.###speakera98.###that is right.###speakerb99.###and if you have somebody who *t*-1 will do it with you,###like, for a long time my husband didn't want *-1 to walk cause he wants *-2 to, uh, jog###speakera100.###uh-huh.###speakerb101.###but he decided that, uh, maybe, uh, you know,###speakera1.###okay.###you think 0 you're getting your money's worth?###speakerb2.###uh, never.###speakera3.###speakerb4.###uh, the only thing 0 i'm, i'm thankful of *t*-1 is that we don't have *-2 to pay any income tax in, in texas.###speakera5.
132554:53	and i, i, i think 0 that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now.	probably	###speakera1.###okay.###you think 0 you're getting your money's worth?###speakerb2.###uh, never.###speakera3.###speakerb4.###uh, the only thing 0 i'm, i'm thankful of *t*-1 is that we don't have *-2 to pay any income tax in, in texas.###speakera5.###well, that's probably the next year's agenda.###speakerb6.###yeah.###boy, i tell you what,###i sure hope 0 they don't pass something like that.###speakera7.###oh, yeah.###they're finding a way 0 * to tax you every time 0 you turn around *t*-1 *t*-2,###and i, i think 0 one way or the other, we're going *-1 to pay for the bureaucracy, i guess 0 *t*-2.###uh, it's one area that *t*-1 is really, i, i think 0 *t*-2 hurting the economy more than anything.###i think 0 the taxes have just, every time 0 you turn around *t*-1 they, they have taking more bite out of the dollars that *t*-2 are available for spending for any kind of products,
132575:60	and where people that make, you know, two hundred, three hundred thousand dollars a year *t*-3, certainly a portion of that, they aren't going *-4 to be paying taxes on *t*-5, you know.	certainly	###speakerb8.###well, i, i tell you, um,###i remember 0 every time, 0 it seems like, we turned around *t*-1, they're adding another nickel or a few more cents onto the price of gasoline.###speakera9.###that's right.###speakerb10.###speakera11.###that's right.###speakerb12.###and actually, that one, the, the, the taxes on gasoline don't, don't bug me as much as, uh, uh, what are we *t*-1, eight and a quarter percent sales tax?###speakera13.###yep,###that's right.###speakerb14.###and every time 0 you go *-1 to buy anything now *t*-2, uh,###even, you know, they, they tax food.###that's the one that *t*-1 really kind of bothers me.###speakera15.###well, i think that, uh, that the problem with the sales tax, of course, is 0 it's an unfair tax across the board, uh, as far as ability * to pay, which a-, allegedly, allegedly taxes are supposed *-1 to be directed *-2 towards *t*-3.###but, uh, now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of, you know, taxes on everything 0 they buy *t*-1,
132608:17	you, maybe you buy that, you know,	maybe	###speakera19.###that's right,###that's right.###and that's the unfairness of the thing,###but, uh, i think 0 taxes generally are unfair###so,###speakerb20.### wha-, what do you think *t*-1 of that new luxury car tax, anything over ten thou-, or thirty thousand dollars?###speakera21.###well, you know, like other things, if they don't affect you, you don't worry about them too much.###speakerb22.###speakera23.###i have trouble *-1 buying a twenty thousand dollar car still,###so it doesn't,### i, i think, uh, you know, 0 generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line, which *t*-1 is, uh, you know.###speakerb24.###oh, sure.###speakera25.###and, uh, i guess 0 if people got thirty, forty thousand bucks 0 * to spend *t*-1 on a car, uh, that's their prerogative, you know.### i, i, i don't have a whole of sympathy on that.
132629:70	one of the best things 0 i heard *t*-1 on taxes * to stimulate the economy, someone, brilliant deductor, probably lloyd bentsen, said that all, you know, if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be, you know, spending more money *-2 using their credit cards.	probably	###and i don't mean *-1 to be knocking, uh,###speakerb26.###no,###uh, no,###i haven't *?*,###but it, it to me it *exp*-1 seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax, uh, on top of it.###and there's an awful lot of cars that *t*-1 cost more than thirty thousand.###speakera27.###yeah,###there are *?*,###there are *?*.###and the idea of that kind of taxation is * to have people think twice on * putting their money into that, i guess 0 *t*-1, you know, unless they really want it,###buy something that, you know, more,###well, it, it's just like * having taxes on *rnr*-1, or exemptions for *rnr*-1 kids, you know.###it's a way of * increasing the population,### that, that was one of the initial ideas of, you know, * giving exemptions on kids, on, on federal taxes.###speakerb28.###yeah.###speakera29.###and where you exempt things, like, uh, uh,
132629:145	one of the best things 0 i heard *t*-1 on taxes * to stimulate the economy, someone, brilliant deductor, probably lloyd bentsen, said that all, you know, if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be, you know, spending more money *-2 using their credit cards.	probably	###and i don't mean *-1 to be knocking, uh,###speakerb26.###no,###uh, no,###i haven't *?*,###but it, it to me it *exp*-1 seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax, uh, on top of it.###and there's an awful lot of cars that *t*-1 cost more than thirty thousand.###speakera27.###yeah,###there are *?*,###there are *?*.###and the idea of that kind of taxation is * to have people think twice on * putting their money into that, i guess 0 *t*-1, you know, unless they really want it,###buy something that, you know, more,###well, it, it's just like * having taxes on *rnr*-1, or exemptions for *rnr*-1 kids, you know.###it's a way of * increasing the population,### that, that was one of the initial ideas of, you know, * giving exemptions on kids, on, on federal taxes.###speakerb28.###yeah.###speakera29.###and where you exempt things, like, uh, uh,
132637:137	but if you look on all interest things, not just credit cards, but on your cars and, you know, a-, any kind of interest that you're paying *t*-1, from a personal point of view, that might make certain sense in * stimulating consumer purchasers.	might	###yeah,###there are *?*,###there are *?*.###and the idea of that kind of taxation is * to have people think twice on * putting their money into that, i guess 0 *t*-1, you know, unless they really want it,###buy something that, you know, more,###well, it, it's just like * having taxes on *rnr*-1, or exemptions for *rnr*-1 kids, you know.###it's a way of * increasing the population,### that, that was one of the initial ideas of, you know, * giving exemptions on kids, on, on federal taxes.###speakerb28.###yeah.###speakera29.###and where you exempt things, like, uh, uh,###one of the best things 0 i heard *t*-1 on taxes * to stimulate the economy, someone, brilliant deductor, probably lloyd bentsen, said that all, you know, if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be, you know, spending more money *-2 using their credit cards.###speakerb30.###right.###speakera31.###speakerb32.###right.###speakera33.###now, i don't know if that's true or not,
132709:8	you probably,	probably	###speakerb16.###oh, really.###speakera17.###and rather than, you know, * pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery, we'll just cook him and eat him.###speakerb18.### is that, is that hard?###speakera19.###well, no,###hey, i tell you what,###* preparing a little pig is, is a snap,###speakerb20.###speakera21.###i'm telling you,###real easy, easier than chicken.###speakerb22.###oh, really.###speakera23.###yeah,###you just, uh,###you kill him, you know,
132737:15	this wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds	probably	###speakerb26.###huh.###speakera27.###speakerb28.###oh, my goodness.###speakera29.###and after about six hours, you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there,###and it's the best eating 0 you ever had *t*-1.###speakerb30.###oh, well, does a boar taste just like regular ham?###speakera31.###yep,###just like a pig###speakerb32.###does it.###speakera33.###i mean, you know, uh, it has a lot less fat.###speakerb34.###huh.###speakera35.
132887:30	or would i, would i probably actually buy *?*.	probably	###that's trees, you know,###we got hundred year old trees that *t*-1 are, you know, twenty feet tall.###speakerb88.###oh, gee.###speakera89.###that's all the bigger 0 they get *t*-1,### they, you know, they're just hard as a rock.###speakera1.###okay.###speakerb2.###all right.###speakera3.###* go ahead.###speakerb4.###well, what kind of car would i want *-1 to buy *t*-2.###speakera5.###yeah.###speakerb6.###i don't know.###the question is, i mean, would i want *-1 to buy *?*,
132912:10	but i maybe would buy a b m w. uh, or, or even a volvo.	maybe	###if i had all the money 0 i wanted *t*-1, then that's whole different matter.###speakera9.###speakerb10.###no,###in that case, i'd, i'd, i don't know.### i, i, my dream car for years was a, was a porsche turbo mumblex.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###speakera13.###uh-huh.###speakerb14.###but, uh, i don't know if i'd want one of those now.###speakera15.###oh, really?###speakerb16.###of course i would want one if somebody was was given *-1 to me.###speakera17.###yeah.###speakerb18.
133020:13	i would probably, if i were *-1 to buy a car mys-, you know, with the constraints of real money i probably would, would go with something like, you know, like a honda accord.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakera55.###so it depends on your destination, too.###speakerb56.###right.###speakera57.###kind of strange.###speakerb58.###you work for a big company, then.###speakera59.###* work for t i. uh-huh, which *t*-1 is how i heard about this *t*-2.###speakerb60.###t i,###i see.###speakera61.###speakerb62.###uh-huh.###um,###but yeah,### i, i, uh, i don't know,
133020:88	i would probably, if i were *-1 to buy a car mys-, you know, with the constraints of real money i probably would, would go with something like, you know, like a honda accord.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakera55.###so it depends on your destination, too.###speakerb56.###right.###speakera57.###kind of strange.###speakerb58.###you work for a big company, then.###speakera59.###* work for t i. uh-huh, which *t*-1 is how i heard about this *t*-2.###speakerb60.###t i,###i see.###speakera61.###speakerb62.###uh-huh.###um,###but yeah,### i, i, uh, i don't know,
133106:13	um, i probably wouldn't *?*, just because i already have one	probably	###speakera89.###speakerb90.###oh.###speakera91.###it didn't actually dent the car or anything.###so it cost me twenty-five bucks *-1 to replace that,###speakerb92.###well, that was good.###speakera93.###and the store will pay for it anyway,###speakerb94.###are you.###speakera95.###so. no big deal.###speakerb96.###uh-huh.###speakera97.###speakerb98.###um, if you were, if you were going *-1 to, uh, buy a new car would you buy another, uh, another accord?###speakera99.
133231:11	it's probably, um,	probably	###it's windy.###speakerb144.###you know, you feel like you're in a boat or something, you know,###it's kind of,###speakera145.###i can't drive that,###the legend, it's just so huge.###speakerb146.###oh.###speakera147.### i, i don't like it,###and it's so, uh,###speakera1.###mumblex how big is provo *t*-1?###speakerb2.###um.###speakera3.###that a little town or, or a bigger city?###speakerb4.###um, it's not one of the bigger ones.
133233:5	maybe a little smaller.	maybe	###you know, you feel like you're in a boat or something, you know,###it's kind of,###speakera145.###i can't drive that,###the legend, it's just so huge.###speakerb146.###oh.###speakera147.### i, i don't like it,###and it's so, uh,###speakera1.###mumblex how big is provo *t*-1?###speakerb2.###um.###speakera3.###that a little town or, or a bigger city?###speakerb4.###um, it's not one of the bigger ones.###it's probably, um,###i compare it to the size of plano,
133244:15	i thought 0 maybe it was you.	maybe	###mumblex how big is provo *t*-1?###speakerb2.###um.###speakera3.###that a little town or, or a bigger city?###speakerb4.###um, it's not one of the bigger ones.###it's probably, um,###i compare it to the size of plano,###maybe a little smaller.###plano, texas.###speakera5.###oh.###i talked to someone that * was only a couple of thousand in her town, i think 0 *t*-2 *t*-1.###speakerb6.###oh, really?###no.###speakera7.###yeah,###i forgot the name of the town.
133248:8	i certainly have some ideas since i'm studying it now in college.	certainly	###that a little town or, or a bigger city?###speakerb4.###um, it's not one of the bigger ones.###it's probably, um,###i compare it to the size of plano,###maybe a little smaller.###plano, texas.###speakera5.###oh.###i talked to someone that * was only a couple of thousand in her town, i think 0 *t*-2 *t*-1.###speakerb6.###oh, really?###no.###speakera7.###yeah,###i forgot the name of the town.###i thought 0 maybe it was you.###speakerb8.###speakera9.###oh, well, anyway, we're supposed *-1 to talk about education.
133283:11	something is definitely wrong.	definitely	###speakerb14.### and, and my dad is actually on the school board there,###so, i kind of kept up with a lot of things that *t*-1 went on.###speakera15.###yeah,###it's###plano, uh, improved greatly in the last twenty, twenty-five years###speakerb16.###yeah.###speakera17.###that's for sure.###it used *-1 to be the pits.###and arlington is excellent now,###but i'm just speaking overall across the country.###speakerb18.###oh.###speakera19.###speakerb20.###yeah.###speakera21.
133294:20	so, um, that's definitely a problem.	definitely	###it used *-1 to be the pits.###and arlington is excellent now,###but i'm just speaking overall across the country.###speakerb18.###oh.###speakera19.###speakerb20.###yeah.###speakera21.###something is definitely wrong.###speakerb22.###uh-huh.###speakera23.###and, uh, one thing, they don't spend as much time *-1 just teaching reading and writing,###so a lot of kids are just being promoted *-1 from year to year###and they truly can't read###speakerb24.###right.###speakera25.###so i don't know how they expect them to, uh, pass history *t*-2 when they can't read anything, you know, even read a word problem in math *t*-1.
133340:34	and, uh, you know, where our kids might be in a great school *t*-1, we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who *t*-2 are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read, you know.	might	###speakera35.###it's up to the teacher, in other words.###so that's kind of o-, you know, that's kind of odd to me.###speakerb36.###yeah.###speakera37.###it depends on, uh, what school you're in *t*-1 and who your teacher is *t*-2, actually###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###speakera39.###or is how you end up *t*-1.###overall, arlington is good, one of the better ones in the state,###so i guess 0 we lucked out when we moved here *t*-1.###speakerb40.###uh-huh.###so, yeah,###that's the thing is * just to look at the school system in the area that you move into *t*-1 before you.###speakera41.###uh-huh.###of course we have a slight problem in that, uh, the number of the illiterate in america is mushrooming at this point,
133375:10	so i probably can't *?*.	probably	###speakera47.###so i guess 0 if there was a national curriculum we'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn *t*-1.###speakerb48.###right.###speakera49.###but, uh. we actually rank *-1 forty-ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes *?*, you know.###speakerb50.###um.###speakera51.### that's, that's pretty low that there's forty-eight countries *ich*-1 ahead of us that *t*-2 have more peop-, more citizens *ich*-3 percentage wise that *t*-4 can read and write,###speakerb52.###yeah.###speakera53.###so, um, unless we want *-1 to keep *-2 paying, paying for these people that *t*-3 can't make it in society, we're going *-4 to have *-5 to do something.###speakerb54.###who do you think 0 it should be done *-1 through *t*-2?.###uh-huh.###speakera55.###i don't know.###obviously nobody's smart enough *-1 to have figured it out yet,
133419:21	i think 0 it'll probably be as difficult.	probably	###did you go to school in plano?###speakerb68.###i did.###speakera69.###through high school.###speakerb70.###uh-huh,###uh, kinder-,###speakerb1.###you think about aids research?###speakera2.###well, aids is a nasty, terrible disease,###and you die from it.###so i think that, uh, they need *-1 to look into it###and it's kind of like cancer.###i don't, you know,###how many years have we tried *-1 to find a cure for cancer *t*-2.###speakerb3.###uh-huh.###speakera4.
133422:21	um, well, i'm certainly in favor of aids research,	certainly	###speakera69.###through high school.###speakerb70.###uh-huh,###uh, kinder-,###speakerb1.###you think about aids research?###speakera2.###well, aids is a nasty, terrible disease,###and you die from it.###so i think that, uh, they need *-1 to look into it###and it's kind of like cancer.###i don't, you know,###how many years have we tried *-1 to find a cure for cancer *t*-2.###speakerb3.###uh-huh.###speakera4.###i think 0 it'll probably be as difficult.###uh, how about yourself.###speakerb5.
133423:17	and i think 0 probably the government could spend a bit more money *ich*-1 on it than it does.	probably	###through high school.###speakerb70.###uh-huh,###uh, kinder-,###speakerb1.###you think about aids research?###speakera2.###well, aids is a nasty, terrible disease,###and you die from it.###so i think that, uh, they need *-1 to look into it###and it's kind of like cancer.###i don't, you know,###how many years have we tried *-1 to find a cure for cancer *t*-2.###speakerb3.###uh-huh.###speakera4.###i think 0 it'll probably be as difficult.###uh, how about yourself.###speakerb5.###um, well, i'm certainly in favor of aids research,
133478:135	i don't, i think 0 it *exp*-1's very strange that the media hasn't, um, questioned him more strongly to, about gay sex or intravenous drugs or anything like that, as they probably would *?* for a lot of other people.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakera20.###uh, do you feel like this is,### i, i guess 0 they're spending a billion or so a year on this aids research.###speakerb21.###uh-huh.###speakera22.###do you think 0 they should spend more?###speakerb23.###uh, i, i think 0 they should *?*, actually, although prob-, perhaps not a, an incredible amount more than what they're doing *t*-1,###and i don't necessarily think that they should, uh, fund aids research and, in the process, neglect cancer research or whatever.###i think that it *exp*-1 would be a good thing for the government to increase funding for medical research in general.###speakera24.###what do you think *t*-1, doug, of mister johnson?###speakerb25.###um well, i, well, i am sorry that he has the virus.###speakera26.###magic?###speakerb27.### i, um, i don't know,
133482:66	um, well, not, not really, though i mean, i think 0 he's probably doing the right thing for a man in his position,	probably	###speakerb21.###uh-huh.###speakera22.###do you think 0 they should spend more?###speakerb23.###uh, i, i think 0 they should *?*, actually, although prob-, perhaps not a, an incredible amount more than what they're doing *t*-1,###and i don't necessarily think that they should, uh, fund aids research and, in the process, neglect cancer research or whatever.###i think that it *exp*-1 would be a good thing for the government to increase funding for medical research in general.###speakera24.###what do you think *t*-1, doug, of mister johnson?###speakerb25.###um well, i, well, i am sorry that he has the virus.###speakera26.###magic?###speakerb27.### i, um, i don't know,### i don't, i think 0 it *exp*-1's very strange that the media hasn't, um, questioned him more strongly to, about gay sex or intravenous drugs or anything like that, as they probably would *?* for a lot of other people.###speakera28.###do you think 0 he's the hero that he's being called *-1 *t*-2 by a bunch of other, a bunch of the media?###speakerb29.
133512:22	i guess 0 you might, might not *?*.	might	###speakerb33.###uh-huh.###speakera34.###uh.###speakerb35.###well, that's good.###speakera36.###i'm glad that mister johnson's changed his tune on, uh, safe sex to abstinence,###or i was glad 0 he did that, for young kids, because a lot of kids would have ended up *-1 dying because of what he was promoting *t*-2.###speakerb37.###uh-huh.###speakera38.###speakerb39.###uh-huh.###speakera40.###uh, * let's see.###what are some of the other questions *t*-1.###uh, you don't, uh,###* let's see.###i don't have any friends that *t*-1 have the disease.
133512:30	i guess 0 you might, might not *?*.	might	###speakerb33.###uh-huh.###speakera34.###uh.###speakerb35.###well, that's good.###speakera36.###i'm glad that mister johnson's changed his tune on, uh, safe sex to abstinence,###or i was glad 0 he did that, for young kids, because a lot of kids would have ended up *-1 dying because of what he was promoting *t*-2.###speakerb37.###uh-huh.###speakera38.###speakerb39.###uh-huh.###speakera40.###uh, * let's see.###what are some of the other questions *t*-1.###uh, you don't, uh,###* let's see.###i don't have any friends that *t*-1 have the disease.
133558:67	um, short term, i don't think 0 anything's going *-1 to be done *-2 about it or probably should be done *-1 about it.	probably	###speakerb49.###um, yeah,### that's, that's basically it, that, um, the immune system can at first slow down,###and the white blood cell count goes down,### which *t*-1 is, that's aids related complex,###but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom *t*-1, that's aids###speakera50.###and,###speakerb51.###and in that case, you know, people are prone to *-2 getting any kind of, you know, weird cancer that only animals got *t*-1 before###speakera52.###oh, really.###speakerb53.###and,###yeah,###that sort of thing,###speakerb1.###all right,###well.###speakera2.
133581:277	um, i'm not really, uh, sure that i even understand why the administration is proposing, for instance, tax reductions *t*-1, because it seems to me that if, if, if they're talking about * reducing, uh, the tax that *t*-4 needs *-2 to be paid *-5, or the tax that *t*-3's currently being paid *-6, then that can't, it seems to me 0 it can't possibly, you know, help with the, the deficit picture.	possibly	###speakera4.###speakerb5.###uh, are you saying 0 you don't think 0 anything should be done *-1 in the short term?###speakera6.###uh, the short term, the recession is getting, getting top attention.###speakerb7.###yeah,### i, i think that you're absolutely right there.###0 the other thing is *t*-1, is that we've got these, um, these, all these bank defaults going on, and, and savings and loan defaults, and, and, uh, uh,###speakera8.###and that effectively adds to whether it's officially on the books or not.###speakerb9.###right.###exactly.###um,###speakera10.###and that's got *-1 to be paid *-2.###speakerb11.###exactly,### and, and, uh, so this creates a pretty serious problem that *t*-1's going *-2 to continue *-3 to be with us for a while 0 *t*-4 to come.
133607:11	it's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is *t*-1.	probably	###speakera14.###um, and the, the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting 0 you can do *t*-1 without, uh, *-2 bringing on, on serious problems for the longer term.###speakerb15.###yeah,###exactly.###speakera16.###so that, that, that's the current predicament.###speakerb17.###yeah,###it see-, seems like it's, it's a kind of a catch twenty-two.###i mean, it's, it's the, um,###my understanding is 0 what they're try-, what, what supposedly they're trying *-1 to do *t*-3 by *-4 reducing taxes is * to kind of jump start the economy, the idea being that if people have *-2 to pay less money in taxes, they'll have more money 0 * to spend *t*-5, uh,###and if they have more money 0 * to spend *t*-1, then that will be a spur to productivity, particularly commercial productivity, uh, which in turn *t*-2 will generate revenue.###but it, it seems like, like, uh, it's sort of a, uh, a sp-, an unending spiral,###and it, it, it, uh,### i'm, i'm not sure that there's any real genuine truth to the, uh, the idea that, that, uh, that * decreasing taxes, particularly the kinds that *t*-1 are being recommended *-2 bye-bye the bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going *-4 to, uh, result in substantial amounts of money, you know, 0 for consumers to spend *t*-3.###and, uh,###speakera18.###yeah,###i'm not sure how i feel *t*-3 about *-2 paying on the quest, the long term quests that tax cuts are worth *t*-1 at this point.
133651:64	i think that, i think that, that i agree with you certainly in the second situation,	certainly	###speakerb29.###yeah, um.###i don't know,###what kind of things do you think 0 *t*-1 can be done *-2 in, in, uh, in the long term?###speakera30.###mumblex well, * can be done *-1 or * will be done *-2 are two different things.###um, at various places 0 * to look *t*-1 for, for * cutting the budget, first of all i consider more defense cuts than *?* are already planned *-2 depending on the world situation.###speakerb31.###sure.###speakera32.###but there are various other areas such as, as farm subsidies that *t*-2 ought *-1 to be slashed *-1.###uh, a lot of entitlement programs, like education aid, i think, uh, 0 they should put a, in###the reagan administration took all such entitlements to the poor but left them for the middle class, uh,###speakerb33.###uh-huh.###speakera34.###in the longer term, uh, we, we, we'd do well, i think 0 *t*-2 *-1 to make, to make, uh, reductions there.###also somewhat mumblex is * to collect owed * to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed *t*-1.###speakerb35.###right.
133702:30	once you get it done, then you probably won't have that problem again.	probably	###speakerb4.###well, it went pretty well, uh, other than the fact that we encountered some, uh, problems that you run across *t*-1 in older homes with plumbing, which one thing led to another *t*-2,###and eventually we ended up *-1 replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain. which *t*-2 meant 0 you needed *-3 to take the wall out and start all over.###speakera5.###gee, like * starting over, i guess *t*-1.###speakerb6.###speakera7.###uh.###speakerb8.###it wasn't one of those,###it started out as a sunday project###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###and by, by the next sunday it was done.###it wasn't a one dayer.###* believe me.###speakera11.###boy, that sounds like, uh,###course, uh, i don't know,
133769:28	well, um, well probably the last thing 0 i did *t*-1 was, uh, * paint and wallpaper kids room	probably	###that's the type of thing 0 you cross your fingers and are glad when that happens *t*-2 *t*-1.###speakerb34.###well, i expected something to leak, you know###left a fitting loose, or didn't use teflon tape on one of them or something like that.###speakera35.###right.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###yes.###speakerb38.###speakera39.###right.###speakerb40.###but it all came together,###so i, i felt pretty fortunate about that.###speakera41.###all worked out all right, huh.###speakerb42.###how about you?###speakera43.
133784:17	and i wonder if maybe i should have used a gloss.	maybe	###speakera41.###all worked out all right, huh.###speakerb42.###how about you?###speakera43.### well, um, well probably the last thing 0 i did *t*-1 was, uh, * paint and wallpaper kids room###speakerb44.###uh-huh.###speakera45.###and, uh, i learned *-1 to,###i used the wrong kind of paint.###this wasn't, must have not been a very good quality, because it just hasn't stood up very well.###speakerb46.###what kind of paint?###speakera47.###it was a latex paint, paint,###it was flat###speakerb48.###uh-huh.###speakera49.
133794:17	but i think 0 maybe, uh,	maybe	###i used the wrong kind of paint.###this wasn't, must have not been a very good quality, because it just hasn't stood up very well.###speakerb46.###what kind of paint?###speakera47.###it was a latex paint, paint,###it was flat###speakerb48.###uh-huh.###speakera49.###and i wonder if maybe i should have used a gloss.###uh, but they say 0 you ought *-1 to use your gloss mainly in your kitchens, and things like that.###speakerb50.###mumblex.###speakera51.###speakerb52.###yeah,###that, and semigloss for trim work, and usually flat for walls.###speakera53.###yeah,
134199:10	well, certainly some of the top end ones.	certainly	###absolutely,###speakerb48.###speakera49.###incredible.###so, um, yeah,###anyway, i've been looking at the prices of these cars and, and so forth,###and i think that it's, it's very surprising 0 some of these very expensive volvos can be gotten *-1 for a lot less money than you would think if you're willing *-2 to buy ones that *t*-3 are about, the vintage of the cars that you and i currently own *t*-4###speakerb50.###is that right,###uh-huh.###speakera51.###speakerb52.###speakera53.###speakerb54.###uh-huh.###speakera55.###and, um,###speakerb56.###well, a brand new volvo costs, what, thirty thousand dollars?###speakera57.
134230:33	up, up there, maybe, maybe you guys don't have as, uh, big a problem with air pollution as many, do you?	maybe	###and i sort of, you know, scan the paper and look at them, and so forth### and so, um, anyway, and that's, that's the other thing is that i've, i've never really been too terribly much of a new car person.###speakerb62.###yeah.###speakera63.###i think 0 i've bought one or two new cars in my life,###and i've tended *-2 to, um, to, uh, buy cars that *t*-1 are, you know, two or three, and sometimes even four and five or six years old.###this honda that i have *t*-1 i bought *t*-2 *-3 used,###and, in fact, it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it.###i've just rolled seventy thousand miles,###and it's a seventy-four, i mean, an eighty-four.###so.###speakerb64.###well, my, my eighty-four just has seventy-seven on it###speakera65.###yeah.###speakerb66.###and i've made many trips to washington and down to virginia beach, virginia, where my mother lives *t*-1, and things like that,###and i drive it,###speakera1.
134230:41	up, up there, maybe, maybe you guys don't have as, uh, big a problem with air pollution as many, do you?	maybe	###and i sort of, you know, scan the paper and look at them, and so forth### and so, um, anyway, and that's, that's the other thing is that i've, i've never really been too terribly much of a new car person.###speakerb62.###yeah.###speakera63.###i think 0 i've bought one or two new cars in my life,###and i've tended *-2 to, um, to, uh, buy cars that *t*-1 are, you know, two or three, and sometimes even four and five or six years old.###this honda that i have *t*-1 i bought *t*-2 *-3 used,###and, in fact, it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it.###i've just rolled seventy thousand miles,###and it's a seventy-four, i mean, an eighty-four.###so.###speakerb64.###well, my, my eighty-four just has seventy-seven on it###speakera65.###yeah.###speakerb66.###and i've made many trips to washington and down to virginia beach, virginia, where my mother lives *t*-1, and things like that,###and i drive it,###speakera1.
134283:5	probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have *-1 to po-, post warnings *ich*-2 now, you know, as far as health concerns.	probably	###speakera19.###uh-huh.###speakerb20.###uh, the state of wisconsin, as a matter of fact, uh, started some litigation against illinois because of the air pollution 0 we were getting *t*-1.###speakera21.###uh-huh.###speakerb22.###uh, i don't think 0 it's going *-1 to go very far,###but it, it was, uh, a way of, uh, * triggering, uh, awareness.###speakera23.###right,###right.###speakerb24.###so what's the conditions like *t*-1 in dallas?###speakera25.###well, uh, in dallas, i, i haven't seen air pollution quite on a, quite on a level that we had *t*-1 in denver.###i grew up in denver,### and, and i've lived there most of my life,###and we used *-1 to have those, uh, you know, the posted warning days.###uh, however, in colorado now, they have the emissions control law, which *t*-1 has really cut down,
134311:15	and all wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of, uh, bike trails for recreational use of any of the states.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakerb30.###and if they don't qualify then they have *-1 to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over *-2 and then verify that it, it is drivable.###speakera31.###um.###speakerb32.###so, they've, they've tried *-1 to do a lot of that###speakera33.###uh-huh.###speakerb34.###and i thi-,###you know, there seem *-1 to be, at least in certain little pockets,###and we were talking earlier about madison###speakera35.###uh-huh.###speakerb36.###madison has one of the nicest, uh, bike, uh, road, uh, sharing programs of, of any city in wisconsin###speakera37.###oh, really.###speakerb38.
134334:5	maybe to you and i who *t*-1 have grown up in some in, uh, uh, some more beautiful parts of the country, uh, i think that, that, uh, we become a little more aware *ich*-2, uh, rather quickly of, of what *t*-3's happening with air pollution and how, uh, how horrible it really is *t*-4.	maybe	###speakerb40.###speakera41.###uh-huh.###speakerb42.###and there is a, a real promotion of, of biking###speakera43.###uh-huh.###speakerb44.###but, um, there are still a lot of people who *t*-1 insist on, on *-2 driving their own automobiles uh, *-3 to go everywhere.###speakera45.###right.###speakerb46.###i find that a little irritating, because i don't think 0 it's always so necessary.###speakera47.###uh-huh.###speakerb48.###speakera49.###yeah,###yeah,### it, it becomes, uh,
134392:89	but, i, um, tend to all the, planting the annuals and, and the spraying and, um, *-1 taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in, you know, throughout that season, and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and, um, any kind of decorating for the holidays, you know,	maybe	###speakera69.###uh-huh.###speakerb70.###that causes the acid rain.###that i'm a little uncertain of *t*-1,###but i do know that, uh, it is a problem.###speakera71.###uh-huh.###speakerb72.###speakera73.###uh-huh.###i had talked with my parents.### i, i grew up, uh, i was born *-1 in, uh, muncie, indiana, and, and grew up a little bit in terre haute,###and i had asked them before, uh,###i went back *-1 to visit recently, about a year ago,###and i asked them,###i said, did you ever realize the air pollution that *t*-1 was,###speakerb1.###* let's see,###my husband does the majority of the, um, the, uh, gardening, uh, * taking care of the lawn and fertilizing,
134392:130	but, i, um, tend to all the, planting the annuals and, and the spraying and, um, *-1 taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in, you know, throughout that season, and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and, um, any kind of decorating for the holidays, you know,	maybe	###speakera69.###uh-huh.###speakerb70.###that causes the acid rain.###that i'm a little uncertain of *t*-1,###but i do know that, uh, it is a problem.###speakera71.###uh-huh.###speakerb72.###speakera73.###uh-huh.###i had talked with my parents.### i, i grew up, uh, i was born *-1 in, uh, muncie, indiana, and, and grew up a little bit in terre haute,###and i had asked them before, uh,###i went back *-1 to visit recently, about a year ago,###and i asked them,###i said, did you ever realize the air pollution that *t*-1 was,###speakerb1.###* let's see,###my husband does the majority of the, um, the, uh, gardening, uh, * taking care of the lawn and fertilizing,
134484:5	maybe one of these days i'll have *-1 to get out there and mow,	maybe	### i think, um, i was thinking about *-1 throwing some for, in the back, just where the kids, um, just way in the back, behind the swing sets###or, just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty.###then you don't really have *-1 to have much maintenance involved *-2.###speakera32.###yeah.###well, my wife and i really enjoy that sort of thing.###speakerb33.###uh-huh.###speakera34.###uh, she enjoys *-1 mowing.###i can't believe it.###speakerb35.###uh-huh,###i know a lot of###speakera36.###i mean, i hate it.###speakerb37.###uh-huh,###a lot of women do. um,###i've just never really, you know,
134632:11	it's definitely new frontier stuff.	definitely	###of course you're going *-1 to lose some that way###speakerb93.###uh-huh.###speakera94.###and the seeds go right through them.###speakerb95.###i see.###speakera96.###and wherever they pooped *t*-1,###speakera1.###uh, well, uh, * to begin,###i guess, uh, 0 space is, uh, real important, i think,###so it's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time, i guess 0 *t*-1.###so.###speakerb2.###yeah,### i, i agree###speakera3.###uh.###speakerb4.
134751:56	it's, it's, it's something *ich*-1 definitely that, uh, you know,	definitely	###so,###speakerb44.###uh-huh.###speakera45.###so you never know what, what *t*-1 may occur,###but as far as me seeing it, you know, i don't know.###speakerb46.###yeah.###speakera47.###speakerb48.###speakera49.###i don't know,###but i think 0 it's real vital important for the future, you know generations 0 *t*-1 to come,###speakerb50.###uh-huh.###speakera51.###so.###speakerb52.###yeah,###i, uh,
134782:14	it's still probably going,	probably	###speakera57.###speakerb58.###yeah,###i wish, uh,###like, uh, boeing or mcdonald douglas or something like that was supposed *-1 to buy, uh, a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it, you know, purely commercial###speakera59.###right.###speakerb60.###speakera61.###uh-huh.###speakerb62.###and they'd go up, you know, and do things###and,###speakera63.###so did they scratch those, uh, that star wars deal, you know, they one 0 we was all worried about russia and all that *t*-2?###speakerb64.###oh.###speakera65.###speakerb66.###no,
134786:43	but the economy the way 0 it is *t*-1 all over, they probably cut back on on that, because it's not,	probably	###like, uh, boeing or mcdonald douglas or something like that was supposed *-1 to buy, uh, a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it, you know, purely commercial###speakera59.###right.###speakerb60.###speakera61.###uh-huh.###speakerb62.###and they'd go up, you know, and do things###and,###speakera63.###so did they scratch those, uh, that star wars deal, you know, they one 0 we was all worried about russia and all that *t*-2?###speakerb64.###oh.###speakera65.###speakerb66.###no,###it's still probably going,###but i don't know whether, it, it, research will go on.###speakera67.###yeah,
134868:101	and, uh, right now we're in a, uh, i guess 0 it's *rnr*-2 either a zero lot line or a garden home. which you might call it *t*-1.	might	###speakera95.###i think 0 we went through him though *-1 to get to gorbachev on a lot of subjects###so,###speakerb96.###uh-huh.###speakera97.###but that way, you can't never tell that.###speakerb98.###yeah.###speakera99.###* kiss some butt,### but, but, uh,###speakerb100.###speakera101.###speakera1.###well, * tell me about your home.###speakerb2.###okay.###uh, right now we're living in,###well it's me, my wife and, uh, two young boys.
135182:26	well, i'm sure 0 you probably are *?*.	probably	###you heard her in the background.###that's babies.###speakera9.###that's your full time, uh, hobby, right?###speakerb10.###* takes a lot of time, huh.###i like, uh, most sports.###i like *-1 to do that.###i kind of like *-1 to do a little bit of sewing.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###oh, little bit of embroidery work, once in a while.###speakera13.###uh-huh.###speakerb14.###what do you like *-1 to do *t*-2?###speakera15.###um, i try *-1 to do some painting, although i'm not very good at it.###speakerb16.
135258:17	well, they're probably easier than * keeping dogs, though, aren't they *?*.	probably	###speakerb38.###speakera39.###but,###speakerb40.###that feels really good.###speakera41.###yeah,###so that's not really my favorite thing 0 * to do *t*-1 or anything,###but i, i need *-2 to do it.###speakerb42.###to do it,###right.###speakera43.### i have, * let's see,###i have a dog, and a lot of fish.###* keeping fish, i guess 0 *t*-1 is my biggest hobby.###speakerb44.###* keeping fish mumblex.###speakera45.###speakerb46.
135267:10	and you probably have *-1 to clean out the tank too.	probably	###speakerb42.###to do it,###right.###speakera43.### i have, * let's see,###i have a dog, and a lot of fish.###* keeping fish, i guess 0 *t*-1 is my biggest hobby.###speakerb44.###* keeping fish mumblex.###speakera45.###speakerb46.###well, they're probably easier than * keeping dogs, though, aren't they *?*.###speakera47.###um, yes and no.###it depends on how frequently they die *t*-1, and how much that bothers you *t*-2.###speakerb48.###oh, no.###speakera49.###speakerb50.###how much that bothers you *t*-1,
135298:50	and so you'd have *-1 to start all over *-2 to build that up probably.	probably	###speakerb54.###oh, you're kidding###speakera55.###because you have,###speakerb56.###because they need *-1 to have a little bit of the,###speakera57.###right,###you need *-1 to let the bacteria build up,###and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance.###speakerb58.###i see.###speakera59.###and i would just take everything out and just like, you know, wash it with scalding hot water###speakerb60.###oh, no.###speakera61.###and it would kill all the bacteria,###and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again###speakerb62.
135368:16	well, they're probably hardy, harder 0 * to take care of *t*-1	probably	###that's right,###i really do.###but, you know.###speakerb86.###do you have all kinds of different fish###or,###speakera87.###yeah,###i just have, you know, what they call *t*-1 community fish guppies, and platies and, and basic things.###speakerb88.###uh-huh.###speakera89.###i don't get into the###speakerb90.###real exotic.###speakera91.###right,###right.###the expensive ones.###speakerb92.
135465:13	we might, right. we might decide what *t*-1's proper and what *t*-2 isn't *?*,	might	###speakera123.### it, and it's funny because the one 0 i have *t*-1, every single month without fail she has babies.###speakerb124.###you're kidding.###speakera125.###oh, no.###all the time,###and, um, i,###and she's supposed *-1 to,###her variety, it says 0 they won't eat the babies,###and i've seen her do it.###so.###speakerb126.###and that just makes you sick almost, doesn't it *?*?###speakera127.###oh, it's ter-,###well, it makes you understand that, you know, things are different.###speakerb128.###things are different in the animal kingdom, huh.###speakera129.
135465:29	we might, right. we might decide what *t*-1's proper and what *t*-2 isn't *?*,	might	###speakera123.### it, and it's funny because the one 0 i have *t*-1, every single month without fail she has babies.###speakerb124.###you're kidding.###speakera125.###oh, no.###all the time,###and, um, i,###and she's supposed *-1 to,###her variety, it says 0 they won't eat the babies,###and i've seen her do it.###so.###speakerb126.###and that just makes you sick almost, doesn't it *?*?###speakera127.###oh, it's ter-,###well, it makes you understand that, you know, things are different.###speakerb128.###things are different in the animal kingdom, huh.###speakera129.
135672:8	i probably have missed the last few since i've been back in school.	probably	###speakera57.###isn't she fabulous?###speakerb58.###oh, she is wonderful.###speakera59.###oh, once you st-,###i don't like *-1 to get one of her books###because, i, i just live *-1 to read.###speakerb60.###speakera61.### i'll, i'll skip everything *-1 just to get back to the book.###speakerb62.###i stayed up one night, i think until two in the morning *-1 finishing one of hers because i star-, i could not put it down.###speakera63.###oh, yeah.###speakerb64.###speakera65.###she's just a,###i don't know,### does she, how often does she come out with them *t*-1.
135716:16	so she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers,	possibly	###speakerb74.###because they go from hardback to paperback###and she has millions of them.###speakera75.###and then * make movies out of some of them.###speakerb76.###uh-huh.###you know, mini series and so forth,###and it seems to me like susan howatch does not write as often.###i have not seen as many of hers.###speakera77.###well, hers are so involved,###and they're so such a higher intellectual level, because she quotes a lot, you know.###speakerb78.###uh-huh.###speakera79.###speakerb80.###i think 0 she does a lot of research, too.###speakera81.###i do too,
135754:7	and maybe that turns people off,	maybe	###speakerb88.###yeah.###speakera89.###maybe it's because they take so much in.###i don't know.###speakerb90.###uh-huh.###maybe they're just too involved 0 for the average person to go and sit through *t*-1 them, you know.###speakera91.###they're so big###speakerb92.###uh-huh.###speakera93.###they're such, you know,###it would be like another gone with the wind,###i guess another three hour movie.###speakerb94.###yeah.###speakera95.###speakerb96.

137291:32	and you're trying *-1 to think oh, maybe i'll need this.	maybe	###speakera61.###yes.###speakerb62.###so, i mean,###speakera63.###i think 0 these extended warranties are gimmicks, really.###speakerb64.###i do too.###speakera65.###a lot of it.### we bought, when we first married *t*-1, we bought one on our t v###and that there's,### it was a five year, after the first five years,###and it was ridiculous.###speakerb66.###uh-huh.###and they charge you a pretty good price for them too.###speakera67.###yes.###they're a pretty healthy price,
137305:8	you probably got your worth out of it anyway.	probably	###speakerb66.###uh-huh.###and they charge you a pretty good price for them too.###speakera67.###yes.###they're a pretty healthy price,###and you're trying *-1 to think oh, maybe i'll need this.### you never, you always think gosh, if i say no, then i won't, you know.###speakerb68.###uh-huh.###speakera69.###but,###speakerb70.###well, my husband finally just put his foot down###speakera71.###i don't know.###speakerb72.###and he said 0 we're not going *-1 to buy any of these anymore,###and if it goes out, well you know.###speakera73.
137317:13	well, you probably are real careful of the brands 0 you buy *t*-1	probably	###speakerb70.###well, my husband finally just put his foot down###speakera71.###i don't know.###speakerb72.###and he said 0 we're not going *-1 to buy any of these anymore,###and if it goes out, well you know.###speakera73.###you probably got your worth out of it anyway.###speakerb74.###speakera75.###speakerb76.###uh-huh,### and, uh, so we really have been fairly happy wi-, with things,###but now we take good care of things###and we don't, uh, run out and buy a lot of, of things either.###and since our kids aren't little anymore, i'm not buying a lot of those little things that *t*-1 can get broken *-2.###speakera77.###yes,###the little,
137318:47	and the, when you do buy things *t*-1, you probably watch what kind of, type of mumblex.	probably	###well, my husband finally just put his foot down###speakera71.###i don't know.###speakerb72.###and he said 0 we're not going *-1 to buy any of these anymore,###and if it goes out, well you know.###speakera73.###you probably got your worth out of it anyway.###speakerb74.###speakera75.###speakerb76.###uh-huh,### and, uh, so we really have been fairly happy wi-, with things,###but now we take good care of things###and we don't, uh, run out and buy a lot of, of things either.###and since our kids aren't little anymore, i'm not buying a lot of those little things that *t*-1 can get broken *-2.###speakera77.###yes,###the little,###well, you probably are real careful of the brands 0 you buy *t*-1
137436:54	but that's my first trip back in, oh, goodness, um, um, thirty years maybe.	maybe	###yeah,###it's gorgeous,###i love the big trees.### just, just the drive up through, uh, up the coast line###and then * cut over in, into the, into the parks,###it's gorgeous, though.###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###speakera43.###what,###like, sequoia national park?###speakerb44.###uh-huh.###speakera45.###uh.###speakerb46.###uh-huh,###yeah,###i had been there before when i lived in california *t*-1,
137540:10	uh, probably the, the last one that i went to california *t*-1	probably	###not around here.###speakera81.###oh.###speakerb82.###not around here.###speakera83.###place is forested *-1 with c-, with those concrete trees.###speakerb84.###uh-huh,### lot, lot of concrete and glass, you know.###speakera85.###yeah.###speakerb86.###speakera87.###well, i guess 0 that's god's place, too.###anyway, uh, what do you figure 0 *t*-1 has been the longest trip 0 you've taken *t*-2 *-3 camping?###speakerb88.###yeah.###speakera89.###speakerb90.
137655:18	uh, football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world.	probably	###speakera21.###yeah,###they made it to the playoffs finally###like just, you know, two years ago they were one and fifteen.###they won like just one game###and so pretty fast turnaround.###but this year they made it to playoffs###and today was *t*-1 the first game###and they beat the chicago bears###so everybody's really going crazy, you know, down here.###speakerb22.###i'll bet 0 they are *?*.###speakera23.###they're going crazy,### so, so they turned it around,###but, you know, they have a lot of young exciting players now, uh,###i mean, everybody was real upset, you know, when they fired tom landry *t*-1,###but, you know, now it's like, you know, they're doing good###so everybody's forgotten about that.###speakerb24.
137844:22	or somebody that *t*-1's maybe got a cadillac or lincoln and lexus dealership, uh	maybe	###yeah.###speakera11.###okay.###speakerb12.###it's kind of their,###speakera13.###i was wondering where that came from *t*-1###because they're talking like it was an american built car.###speakerb14.###right,### it, it sounds like it,###but it really isn't *?*.###speakera15.###yeah.###speakerb16.###it's, uh, marketed *-1, of course, it its own dealerships.###speakera17.###yeah.###speakerb18.###usually,
137906:36	this is a, uh, uh, probably suspension tied * into the brakes.	probably	###you get the impression that,###speakerb34.###uh, some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north. the c d and the premium sound system.###speakera35.###uh-huh.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###skidding control,###you mean the antilock brake system?###speakerb38.###yeah,###it's kind of a traction control, i think 0 they call it *?*.###speakera39.###yeah.###speakerb40.### it's, it's not just antilock brake.###i think 0 that's already on most of them,###but there is a further traction control, uh,###speakera41.###oh,
137925:13	mississippi probably doesn't, mississippi probably doesn't have *-1 to worry too much.	probably	###oh,###this is a, uh, uh, probably suspension tied * into the brakes.###speakerb42.###speakera43.###speakerb44.###yeah.###speakera45.###speakerb46.### and, and also the suspension can be raised *-1 for * driving, like in the ice and snow.###it can raise the car's center up a little bit. for * going under a lot of piled up stuff if you were up in michigan or somewhere.###speakera47.###um.###speakerb48.###speakera49.###yeah.###speakerb50.###speakera51.###yeah,###uh, shoot###speakerb52.
137925:29	mississippi probably doesn't, mississippi probably doesn't have *-1 to worry too much.	probably	###oh,###this is a, uh, uh, probably suspension tied * into the brakes.###speakerb42.###speakera43.###speakerb44.###yeah.###speakera45.###speakerb46.### and, and also the suspension can be raised *-1 for * driving, like in the ice and snow.###it can raise the car's center up a little bit. for * going under a lot of piled up stuff if you were up in michigan or somewhere.###speakera47.###um.###speakerb48.###speakera49.###yeah.###speakerb50.###speakera51.###yeah,###uh, shoot###speakerb52.
137946:24	and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter 0 they'd seen *t*-1 in twenty years,	probably	###speakera53.###some of these muddy driveways could use it around here.###speakerb54.###speakera55.###no,###snow doesn't happen very often.###speakerb56.###if it does, people go, what's this stuff *t*-1.###speakera57.###yeah,###uh, originally i'm from west virginia.###we got a pretty fair amount of snow.###speakerb58.###oh,###well, you had some there.###speakera59.###speakerb60.###yeah.###speakera61.###but, uh, i got down here in june of eighty-four,
138039:15	the lincoln ride is certainly good, too,	certainly	###speakera91.###* imagine, or not,### they make a, they make a luxury mercury tracer.###speakerb92.###yeah,###i've seen that in the dealership.###i was driving a lincoln, a mark seven for the last four years before i traded it for this###speakera93.###yeah.###speakerb94.###and, uh, i'm leasing the lexus.###i usually lease them since i own a business###speakera95.###yeah.###speakerb96.###i just run it through my business,### but but it,###speakera97.###uh-huh.###speakerb98.
138062:111	but, uh, i think 0 they're, big city public schools by definition are having a, a tough time right now just from, uh, probably from budget cuts and, and everything else going on.	probably	###speakera99.###like * sitting in your living room.###speakerb100.###yeah,###it really is *?*,###and it's got a lumbar support in the seats.###speakera101.###adjustable?###speakerb102.###adjustable, uh power###speakera103.###yeah.###speakerb104.###and * just kind of brings that support up in the sma-,###speakera1.###okay,###uh, so what do you think *t*-1 about the school system?###speakerb2.###well, i think 0 they're, they're having a lot of trouble right now.###i know 0 my son goes to a private school,
138093:13	so it's maybe a hundred per grade.	maybe	###speakerb8.###so,###speakera9.###then how does he like it *t*-1?###speakerb10.###oh, he's loved it.###he is a senior in high school this year###so he's,###speakera11.###so he's been there all the time.###speakerb12.###speakera13.###speakerb14.###yeah,###he's done it the whole twelve and, uh, so many years###and it's been, uh, it's been really good for him.###speakera15.###how big of a school is it *t*-1?###speakerb16.###uh, overall on campus about twelve hundred, but in the upper school, upper four grades, uh, about four hundred and something
138205:15	so life is not maybe as simple as it was *?* at one time,	maybe	###speakerb56.###speakera57.###and,###speakerb58.###and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands.###speakera59.###well, how do you think that that's happened *t*-1?###you think 0 our society's just, uh, stopped *-1 talking out,###or this, uh generation's just kind of changed a little bit, uh,###speakerb60.###i guess, 0 i,###speakera61.###speakerb62.###well, the world changes,###so i mean, obviously, kids are not the same *ich*-1 now as they used *-2 to be *?*.###speakera63.###right.###speakerb64.###i mean they're exposed *-1 to a whole lot more things.###they have a whole lot more, uh, variety of things they they're, that they see and do *t*-1 at an earlier age,
138249:17	so i think that maybe that's effected it to some degree.	maybe	###and it had *-1 to be matching###and,###speakerb76.###and when it was skirts *t*-1, it was like, * get down on the floor###and we hold the ruler up here###speakera77.###yes.###speakerb78.###and it's no more than so many inches above the knee.###speakera79.###exactly.###speakerb80.###speakera81.###yes.###speakerb82.###because it was mini skirt time back there at one time.###speakera83.###yes,###so it's really changed.###it's, uh, really kind of gone the rounds,
138254:18	i think 0 that probably does have, have something 0 *t*-1 to do with it,	probably	###speakera77.###yes.###speakerb78.###and it's no more than so many inches above the knee.###speakera79.###exactly.###speakerb80.###speakera81.###yes.###speakerb82.###because it was mini skirt time back there at one time.###speakera83.###yes,###so it's really changed.###it's, uh, really kind of gone the rounds,###so i think that maybe that's effected it to some degree.###they say 0 you kind of act how you're dressed *-1 *t*-2 a little bit,###so i,###speakerb84.###yeah,
138393:31	whereas if you're ripping wood, you're probably better off with a, a table saw.	probably	###yeah.###speakerb42.###and i, i debate whether it *exp*-1's better * to get a, uh, just a straight table saw or to get one of these, uh, rotary arm saws.###speakera43.###oh.###speakerb44.###radial arm saw is, i guess 0 *t*-3, what they're called *-1 *t*-2.###speakera45.###uh-huh.###speakerb46.###uh, it t-, seems to me 0 the radial arm saw is, is better,###well, it, it takes up less room.###speakera47.###yeah.###speakerb48.###i mean, you, you set the wood down###and you move the saw.###speakera49.###yeah.###speakerb50.
138503:13	so that was probably my own fault that she didn't,	probably	###i took, uh, cammy to a,###oh, it was a preschool day-care type of thing.###speakerb14.###oh, uh-huh.###speakera15.###but i kind of, i liked it some ways###and some ways i didn't.###uh, i think 0 the ratio of kids to teacher is really important.###speakerb16.###oh, yeah,###yeah.###speakera17.###and,###speakerb18.###how was it *t*-1?###speakera19.###well, i think 0 they had a, they had two teachers###and i think 0 there were twenty kids,###but i only had her going two days###and most of the other kids were going more days
138551:7	and maybe that was,	maybe	###and i w-,###like i said, i didn't notice it till then. because i hadn't worked with * writing letters or anything and stuff like that.###speakerb30.###oh.###speakera31.###speakerb32.###uh-huh.###speakera33.###speakerb34.###well, they'd never picked it out, though?###speakera35.###no.###speakerb36.###huh.###speakera37.###they never,###speakerb38.###or * just never said anything.###speakera39.###course, like i said, i took her two days a week
138640:47	but, i think 0 for * taking kids to a, probably people that *t*-1 take them to, uh, preschools and day-cares full time, oh, they would, i don't know, probably just feel a different,	probably	###speakera65.###yeah,###it *exp*-1's kind of hard * to always feel, gosh, what, is this important what i'm doing *t*-1###and,###speakerb66.###yeah,###well, uh, the work never ends.###speakera67.###no.###speakerb68.###that's for sure.###speakera69.###no,### it, it doesn't.###speakerb70.###so,###speakera71.###speakerb72.###huh.###speakera73.
138640:125	but, i think 0 for * taking kids to a, probably people that *t*-1 take them to, uh, preschools and day-cares full time, oh, they would, i don't know, probably just feel a different,	probably	###speakera65.###yeah,###it *exp*-1's kind of hard * to always feel, gosh, what, is this important what i'm doing *t*-1###and,###speakerb66.###yeah,###well, uh, the work never ends.###speakera67.###no.###speakerb68.###that's for sure.###speakera69.###no,### it, it doesn't.###speakerb70.###so,###speakera71.###speakerb72.###huh.###speakera73.
138681:91	i think 0 it's a trend that *t*-3's, that *t*-4's, that *t*-1's, uh, probably may go nationwide eventually because i think 0 national health is something that we all need *t*-2.	probably	###speakera6.###what would we like *-2 to say *t*-1.###i think,###speakerb7.###speakera8.###uh-huh.###speakerb9.###speakera10.###i think 0 that's what the subject is about *t*-1.###speakerb11.###did you read, uh, the article in the paper today about this particular subject?###speakera12.###in the dallas, the morning times?###speakerb13.###yeah.###speakera14.###i guess 0 i did not.###speakerb15.###uh, the state of washington and the state of minnesota is, uh, going *-1 to begin *-2 testing a program, a state funded program for citizens of those two states###and there's fourteen other, uh, states that *t*-1 are considering it. least according to the article in the paper this morning.
138774:87	and i feel very strongly about, uh, children, and, uh, developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year. where we certainly proved that we're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who *t*-1 need it most *t*-2.	certainly	###speakera46.###sure.###speakerb47.###that happens.###speakera48.###it does happen,###but it's very sad.###speakerb49.###yeah,###but in any event, uh, i'm in favor of national health. if i had *-1 to vote for it.###speakera50.###well so am *t*-1 i.###speakerb51.###speakera52.###speakerb53.###speakera54.###actually, uh, i'm a pediatrician###speakerb55.###oh, is that right?###speakera56.
139054:37	and other than that, you know, it would be maybe october and then in the spring	maybe	###speakerb73.###so,###speakera74.### they, they, it was after i was already working there###and they weren't testing any of those who *t*-1 were already working.###speakerb75.###right.###speakera76.###so,###speakerb1.###okay.###speakera2.###yeah.###speakerb3.###well, considering 0 you moved here from california, i guess, 0 the rain for the past few weeks has been different than what you have *t*-1 down there.###speakera4.###yeah,###we have, uh, in california,### i'm in c-, i lived in central california.###we have rain couple times a year
139140:44	but, uh, it's, uh, it's definitely different.	definitely	### i'm a, i'm a scoutmaster###and so i wind up *-1 going out *-2 camping with, uh, a bunch of boys at one time###and so, it's better for us if it hasn't been this totally wet before we go.###speakera32.###uh-huh.###speakerb33.###speakera34.###yeah.###so you do that even in january, huh?###speakerb35.###oh, yeah.###speakera36.###uh-huh.###speakerb37.###yeah,###we camp year round.###speakera38.###yeah, oh,###that's interesting.###speakerb39.
139243:85	you don't think about that as a career, a normal career, uh, when you're thinking of things that people might be doing *t*-1 *t*-2.	might	###speakerb81.###oh.###speakera82.###it's an organization where we are looking *-1 to translate the bible into languages of the world that *t*-2 aren't yet written *-3 *t*-4.###speakerb83.###not so much * still trying *-1 to translate old texts as * just trying *-3 to translate modern versions into other languages.###speakera84.###right,###languages that *t*-1 don't have anything written * yet.###so this is like the first thing that *t*-1's written *-2 down###or you know, first an alphabet is developed *-1###speakerb85.###oh.###speakera86.###and then, uh,###speakerb87.###that's interesting.###speakera88.###so,###speakerb89.
139292:8	you probably do a lot of that with scout scouting.	probably	### i, i thought 0 the fall was really nice.###speakerb101.###yeah,###and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice, too. after the last freeze###speakera102.###uh-huh.###speakerb103.### and, and when it begins *-1 to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time *t*-2, uh, i like that. particularly if i'm going *-3 to be outdoors and doing, uh, outdoor activity, hiking and things.###speakera104.###yeah.###speakerb105.###speakera106.###uh-huh.###speakerb107.###speakera108.###uh-huh.###speakerb109.###and that's nicer.###speakera110.###yeah,
139438:14	i was just probably three or four years,	probably	###uh, but, uh, the, you know, the french,###yeah###we go in as an ally to the french and says yeah, we'll, we'll help you out, if you get in a bind.###well, they got in a bind and says we don't want *-1 to, you know, play any more###speakera27.###uh-huh.###speakerb28.###so, uh, we, we kind of, we kind of got, got the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly organi-, uh, um, oh, operations and then the full scale, you know, full scale troops, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.###speakera29.###yeah,###i'm thirty-two,###so, uh, i bar-,###well, i missed it.###seventy-four is when they quit * sending troops *t*-1.###speakerb30.###uh, yeah,###yeah###roughly.###speakera31.###yeah.
139633:99	now i've done it with, where you put, you cook the ri-, well, i guess 0 you probably could do it same way, but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup, and put a little bit of white wine in it *t*-1.	probably	### and, and you put the chicken in, then pour the, uh, broth over###and you can put mushrooms in if you want *?*,###and then you just.###speakerb77.###over the uncooked rice?###speakera78.###yeah,###over uncooked rice###speakerb79.###oh.###speakera80.###and you can either microwave it or do it in the oven,###and it just.###speakerb81.###oh, how neat.###speakera82.###it fluffs up,###and it's really moist.###speakerb83.###huh.
139732:7	or maybe it's only half hour.	maybe	###uh-huh.###yeah.###speakerb115.###um. now that would be good.###speakera116.###uh-huh.###speakerb117.###how long do you have *-1 to bake it *t*-2?###speakera118.###um, * let's see.###i think 0 it was an hour.###i've done it in the microwave so often lately because, it's, it's really easy.###speakerb119.### i do, i do microwave too, a lot.###speakera120.###yeah.###but, i think 0 it's about an hour.###speakerb121.### how long would it be *t*-1 how long would it be *t*-2 in the microwave?###speakera122.
139962:27	um, you know, uh, maybe three hundred, four hundred feet elevation, uh, type variations from the valleys up to the hills, the hilltops.	maybe	###it's,###well, um, my parents' house is like three miles south of where the mason-dixon line would have hit the ohio river *t*-1 had it continued that far.###speakerb70.###gosh.###speakera71.###speakerb72.###i see.###speakera73.###so,###speakerb74.###it's pretty nice country up there?###speakera75.###oh, it's beautiful.###speakerb76.###hills, or what?###speakera77.###uh, well, from my neck of the woods, it's hilly.###speakerb78.###uh-huh.###speakera79.
140057:7	and probably a good, uh, student teacher ratio and things.	probably	###* hope 0 it's a good program there.###speakera113.###pardon?###speakerb114.###* hope 0 it's a good program there.###speakera115.###uh, it seems to me, from what i've been able *-1 to find *t*-2 out.###speakerb116.###yeah,###good.###speakera117.###that's considered *-1 a pretty good program.###it's nice and small, which *t*-1 means, you know, 0 if you don't get the class this semester, then you've got *-2 to wait or three or four s-, you know, anywhere from two to four semesters *-3 to get, it again.###speakerb118.###huh.###speakera119.###but, uh, i-, it's worth it once you get it.###speakerb120.###well, yes,###that's good.
140073:31	uh, well, um, first off we'd probably wind up with a, a cat or maybe a puppy.	probably	###but, uh, i-, it's worth it once you get it.###speakerb120.###well, yes,###that's good.###and probably a good, uh, student teacher ratio and things.###speakera121.###oh, yeah,###yeah.###speakerb122.###yeah.###speakera123.###most the class are pretty small.###speakerb124.###good.###speakera125.###that works out real well.###speakerb126.###well, i, i was wondering what, if you all were *-2 to get a pet, like if you were *-1 to move into an apartment or a house somewhere,###what would you get *t*-1?###speakera127.
140073:66	uh, well, um, first off we'd probably wind up with a, a cat or maybe a puppy.	maybe	###but, uh, i-, it's worth it once you get it.###speakerb120.###well, yes,###that's good.###and probably a good, uh, student teacher ratio and things.###speakera121.###oh, yeah,###yeah.###speakerb122.###yeah.###speakera123.###most the class are pretty small.###speakerb124.###good.###speakera125.###that works out real well.###speakerb126.###well, i, i was wondering what, if you all were *-2 to get a pet, like if you were *-1 to move into an apartment or a house somewhere,###what would you get *t*-1?###speakera127.
140186:60	one year down in florida on a vacation, for father's day, my kids, years ago, maybe, uh, ten years ago, go, bought me a skunk from a exotic pet shop.	maybe	###i'll be darned *-1.###speakerb30.###no,###i guess 0 we didn't have it high enough or he didn't get hit *-1 in just the right spot,###speakera31.###speakerb32.###but it threw him up against the wall, you know,###and he slid down the wall.###speakera33.###well, * speaking of pets, i'll tell you, 0 my, my kids are older now, my, both of them are either in or out of college,### but, but we had for years, about five years i guess, had a, my son had a burmese boa constrictor,###and that thing grew *-1 to be seven and a half feet in, in length,###speakerb34.###oh, gosh.###oh, i hate them.###speakera35.###and finally my wife, wife, * bless her heart, got rid *-1 of it, because i didn't really like it.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###we also had a,
140458:8	it certainly is frightening.	certainly	###oh, i see.###speakera51.###so that means 0 i have *-1 to depend on, on trustworthy friends###speakerb52.###right.###speakera53.###and that's.###anyway, it's fixed,###it's running,###and i pray that i get my thirteen hundred dollars out of it.###speakerb54.###oh, gosh.###speakera55.###uh-huh.###speakerb56.###it's going *-1 to run for a li-, for a while yet.###speakera57.###oh, i know it.###speakerb58.###speakera59.
140494:10	so i certainly hope 0 you have a nice new year.	certainly	###no,###okay.###speakera67.###no,###i have just retired from, um, the southwest medical center.###speakerb68.###oh.###speakera69.###yeah, where there are a lot of people *ich*-2 down there that *t*-1 could help me with my car *t*-3,###but they're all too busy.###so.###speakerb70.###yeah.###speakera71.###i have *-1 to do it the other way,###and that's * find someone and pay them to do it.###speakerb72.###yeah,###yeah.###speakera73.
140638:30	it's, it's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood,	certainly	###speakerb42.###i'd rather have, have more rooms and less space in each one i guess 0 *t*-1.###rather have lots of rooms and lot-, lots of space,###but, uh, that ends up *-1 costing me.###speakera43.###oh yeah,###speakerb44.###speakera45.###yeah.###well, like, um, how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood *t*-1?.###speakerb46.###well, they're, it's pretty typical,###i mean, it's a very, very middle class neighborhood.###uh, lots of, lots of young couples with, you know, usu-, oh,###i'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood, that's their first homes###speakera47.###oh, uh-huh.###speakerb48.###and, uh, lots of kids and stuff,###and, so it, it fits well, in the neighborhood.
140652:100	it, it, it, it does, it, it seems about, oh, probably average.	probably	###i'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood, that's their first homes###speakera47.###oh, uh-huh.###speakerb48.###and, uh, lots of kids and stuff,###and, so it, it fits well, in the neighborhood.### it's, it's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood,###but on the other hand, it's clean and kind of suburban little bit more than i want *t*-1.###speakera49.###yeah.###speakerb50.###speakera51.###yeah.###speakerb52.### is, is yours also pretty much in conformance with the neighborhood###speakera53.###uh.###speakerb54.###speakera55.###yeah,
140705:11	it's definitely not one of the, the smaller ones,	definitely	###i'm sure, with eight,###gosh.###speakera69.###yeah,###they're building a lot bigger.###he's, uh, um, uh, oh, not an obstetrician, an, an orthopedic surgeon.###speakerb70.###uh-huh.###speakera71.### and, um, so since the house did burn, they're, they're going,###it's quite different than it was *?* before,###and it's it's a lot bigger.###speakerb72.###uh-huh.###speakera73.###speakerb74.###yeah.###speakera75.### and, um, but ours is about,### it's, you know, it's a nice home,
140884:30	have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside *t*-1?	maybe	###speakera27.###yeah,### we, we try *-1 to take it, you know,### it gets, it gets frustrating when you take it outside *t*-1### and, you know and then it runs right inside###speakerb28.### does, does it just want *-1 to sniff around?###speakera29.###and it does it. huh?###speakerb30.###does it just want *-1 to sniff around and play when it's outside *t*-2?###speakera31.###yeah,###a lot of times,###and you know, it won't it's little job outside###speakerb32.###yeah.###speakera33.###and it comes inside.###speakerb34.
140959:15	you know, maybe you nee-, you can get it signed *-1 up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes.	maybe	### what, what's the deal *t*-1,### we, we try *-2 to, we're trying *-1 to take it on walks now, you know###speakerb58.###uh-huh.###speakera59.###and we can't *?* because it's not accustomed to *-1 being on a leash###speakerb60.###yeah.###speakera61.###and so it, i mean this dog really feels like it's being killed *-1 or something when you try *-2 to, you know, tug on it *-3 to walk it *t*-4.###i mean, it just goes like a mad dog,###i mean it just jumps up and down and starts *-1 yapping,###and it's, you know, i mean, it's not even close to * even being trained *-1 on a leash.###speakerb62.###does it, oh.###speakera63.###speakerb64.###uh-huh.###speakera65.###speakerb66.
141103:68	and, uh, my husband and i will go out to dinner and come home and, um, probably not too late.	probably	### it is *?*.###it is hard because, you know, at the end of your day you want time for yourself###speakera21.###uh-huh.###speakerb22.###speakera23.###yeah.###speakerb24.### and, and it,###and that's kind of cutting into your, your time.###speakera25.###yeah.###speakerb26.###and with the kids getting older, now on the weekends they get to the bed like at ten which *t*-1 really is late,###speakera27.###uh-huh.###speakerb28.###but, you know, on school nights, the two older ones get to bed about nine.###they go upstairs at nine,###and, um, now, this weekend we'll have a baby-sitter come
141183:24	i think 0 in plano and maybe this area in texas, there's a lot of community activities that parents could join in *t*-1 with their kids.	maybe	###yeah.###so what do you feel 0 *t*-1 are the current trends in the way 0 families spend time in general, you know, in america *t*-2?###speakerb52.### i, i think 0 a lot of people, a lot of people s-, set their kids in front of the t v and h b o and rent movies and, and, kind of leave them to their own means.###um,###speakera53.###uh-huh.###speakerb54.###speakera55.###yeah.###speakerb56.###i think, you know, 0 it *exp*-1's very, very easy * to fall into that trap,###and i'm not, um, totally innocent of that because, there's times when you just stay here, watch a tape *t*-1.###speakera57.###uh-huh.###speakerb58.###speakera59.###yeah.###speakerb60.###but, um, um, i think 0 different parts of the country,
141245:143	i, i personally feel that it *exp*-1 is extremely important * to be with your own child, um, for the, at least for the first two years of their lives. i mean, if you, can possibly swing it	possibly	###speakerb78.###because she has such a flexible schedule,###but it *exp*-1's very hard * to, uh, spend time with the children and, uh, and your husband and do everything at once.###speakera79.###uh-huh.###speakerb80.###speakera81.###yeah.###but i do feel like it *exp*-1's important that you make the time for children because,###speakerb82.###well, i think 0 it's a big, it's a big, um, responsibility.###you just don't, have children so that you can continue the lifestyle 0 you had *t*-2 when you were single *t*-1.###speakera83.###yeah.###speakerb84.###speakera85.###yeah.###speakerb86.###when you have children *t*-1, you have *-2 to say, now, this is different###and you do have *-1 to give things up.
141341:43	and so we have *-1 to plan anywhere from six, well really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone, can uh, start their, uh, vacation time.	probably	###so, uh, the day 0 it happens *t*-1 is ninety-eight percent of the planning usually.###speakerb27.###oh, really.###speakera28.###yeah.###uh, we, uh, get together, at the, uh, the park, uh, the, uh, the park, and playground area of the church 0 i was raised *-2 in *t*-1###speakerb29.###yeah.###speakera30.###and, uh, everybody brings lots of food###and some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat.###speakerb31.###* eat a lot.###speakera32.###oh, gosh.###speakerb33.###it is a lot harder for us because we are like i said we are spread out###speakera34.###yeah.###speakerb35.
141419:10	well, maybe this year you can find a more central location.	maybe	###speakerb59.###so, unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together, it is kind of like.###she was like the glue,###so.###speakera60.###yeah,###i understand.###where is home *t*-1 for you?###speakerb61.###originally, uh, i, uh, was born *-1 in missouri.###speakera62.###yeah.###speakerb63.###but, uh, you know, we have relatives scattered * out all over louisiana, mississippi, uh, here in texas###speakera64.###yeah.###speakerb65.###but it *exp*-1 is harder for everyone to get in, get home.###speakera66.###yeah.
141454:30	well, uh, uh, i guess 0 probably the last one 0 i went to *t*-1 i met so many people that i had not seen *t*-2 in probably ten, over ten years.	probably	###speakerb71.###well, uh, how do you all communicate *t*-2? like *-1 to plan it and every thing.###do you all just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend 0 we are going *-1 to do it *t*-2,###or do you all like mail out stuff?###speakera72.###that is pretty much it.###yeah.###it is going *-1 to be such and such, uh, weekend###and, uh, you all come.###speakerb73.###yeah.###speakera74.###that is about it.###and you know this is the standard pattern.###it, uh,###everybody brings their favorite dish###and, somebody brings the volleyball net,###somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon###and,###speakerb75.
141454:95	well, uh, uh, i guess 0 probably the last one 0 i went to *t*-1 i met so many people that i had not seen *t*-2 in probably ten, over ten years.	probably	###speakerb71.###well, uh, how do you all communicate *t*-2? like *-1 to plan it and every thing.###do you all just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend 0 we are going *-1 to do it *t*-2,###or do you all like mail out stuff?###speakera72.###that is pretty much it.###yeah.###it is going *-1 to be such and such, uh, weekend###and, uh, you all come.###speakerb73.###yeah.###speakera74.###that is about it.###and you know this is the standard pattern.###it, uh,###everybody brings their favorite dish###and, somebody brings the volleyball net,###somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon###and,###speakerb75.
141481:27	well, i think 0 that is probably why our is probably so interesting *t*-1 is cause we don't have them that often	probably	###i know.###speakera78.###yeah,###i married your cousin's brother's uncle or something like that.###speakerb79.###do you,###i mean, is that since,### i mean do you have them every year?###speakera80.###uh, yeah,###every year.###speakerb81.###mumblex.###speakera82.###and, uh, still, you wind up *-1 meeting people 0 you, uh, you never knew 0 you were related to *t*-2. let alone###speakerb83.###yeah.###speakera84.###and,###speakerb85.
141481:41	well, i think 0 that is probably why our is probably so interesting *t*-1 is cause we don't have them that often	probably	###i know.###speakera78.###yeah,###i married your cousin's brother's uncle or something like that.###speakerb79.###do you,###i mean, is that since,### i mean do you have them every year?###speakera80.###uh, yeah,###every year.###speakerb81.###mumblex.###speakera82.###and, uh, still, you wind up *-1 meeting people 0 you, uh, you never knew 0 you were related to *t*-2. let alone###speakerb83.###yeah.###speakera84.###and,###speakerb85.
141541:17	maybe, maybe you will get lucky and get a girl this time.	maybe	###speakerb13.###no.###i am just about three months,###and, uh, i don't think 0 we really even want *-1 to find out.###speakera14.###i do not blame you.###speakerb15.###we like surprises.###so. we will take either.###speakera16.###well, we have got two boys and a girl also.###well, we have got two boys and a girl.###speakerb17.###and, uh, does it,###are the two boys first?###speakera18.###yes.###speakerb19.###oh.###speakera20.
141583:7	but maybe that riding place that *t*-2 is north of town that she goes to *t*-1.	maybe	###oh yeah.###you kind of got, uh, a span there,###huh?###speakera28.###speakerb29.###oh, well what do you do *t*-1 with your seventh grader?###speakera30.###well, she is into a little bit of everything.###she is, uh, loves *-1 riding horses###so she goes out *-1 riding as much as she can *?*.###speakerb31.###do you have horses?###speakera32.###no.###speakerb33.### she, just, she knows people that *t*-1 does,###huh?###speakera34.###well, that,###yeah
141633:11	well you probably know a peace group that, uh, that they are advanced type. that they are special, well, uh, classes for peace classes.	probably	###and###speakera42.###well, my wife is involved###and she kind of heads that up for these kids,###and last year they, they, got, uh, the state level.###they did not win that,###but they, uh, got one local and, uh, one region,###and they got a new mix of kids this time.###so, it keeps them busy.###speakerb43.###oh, uh-huh.###speakera44.###it keeps them busy.###speakerb45.###oh, yeah###i bet.###huh, well so does she go actually out into a different classroom with, with, uh, other kids that *t*-1 are involved in this?###speakera46.###well, uh, yes,###but they, well they have,
141946:8	we certainly get enough coverage.	certainly	### that's, um, that's been like that since they, the first newspaper, you know.###speakera60.###yeah,###yeah,###i'm sure.###speakerb61.###you know, but, um, i don't know.### i, i guess 0 i'm satisfied,###i don't, uh.###speakera62.###uh-huh.###speakerb63.###i mean, what basis, you know, of comparison do we have *t*-1 really?###speakera64.###yeah,###really.###speakerb65.###we don't get a, you know.###speakera66.###that's true.
142100:18	i think 0 that might be true.	might	###or do you pull a cart when you play golf *t*-1?###speakerb12.###uh, both.###speakera13.###oh.###speakerb14.###not at the same time.###speakera15.###i was going *-1 to say, 0 that could be difficult.###speakerb16.###no, sometimes we ride###and sometimes, uh, we, pull,###we like *-1 to, to, uh, a lot of the times just walk, uh, for the exercise.###but###speakera17.###uh-huh.###speakerb18.###i find that when i ride in a cart *t*-1, i play better###and i think 0 it is cause i don't get as tired.###speakera19.
142175:17	but my golf clubs will probably rust before i get *-1 to use them again	probably	###speakerb38.###oh, okay.###speakera39.###so, i have, uh, i have, uh, i have children 0 *t*-1 boy scout age.###speakerb40.###you must have a, a son.###speakera41.###i have two boys that *t*-1 are boy scout age,###and, uh, so i am very active in boy scouts###speakerb42.###oh, okay.###speakera43.###so i would have *-1 to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and boy scouts is my hobby.###speakerb44.###yeah.###speakera45.###but i###speakerb46.###oh well that sounds like fun too.###speakera47.
142177:13	and it is probably going *-1 to be six to eight years before they go to college.	probably	###speakera39.###so, i have, uh, i have, uh, i have children 0 *t*-1 boy scout age.###speakerb40.###you must have a, a son.###speakera41.###i have two boys that *t*-1 are boy scout age,###and, uh, so i am very active in boy scouts###speakerb42.###oh, okay.###speakera43.###so i would have *-1 to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and boy scouts is my hobby.###speakerb44.###yeah.###speakera45.###but i###speakerb46.###oh well that sounds like fun too.###speakera47.###but my golf clubs will probably rust before i get *-1 to use them again###because my boys are still right at the beginning age
142188:16	well, they would probably never make it then	probably	###speakerb44.###yeah.###speakera45.###but i###speakerb46.###oh well that sounds like fun too.###speakera47.###but my golf clubs will probably rust before i get *-1 to use them again###because my boys are still right at the beginning age###and it is probably going *-1 to be six to eight years before they go to college.###speakerb48.###uh-huh.###well, you need *-1 to, uh, teach them how * to play *t*-2 and take them out on the course with you.###speakera49.###that's right.###lessons are expensive though.###speakerb50.###oh, yeah.###well you can teach them.###speakera51.
142252:17	i put mine in probably in november.	probably	###so you said 0 you work, uh, in the gardens too.###do you have, uh, a special flowers?###speakerb72.###well flower gardens.###i like *-1 to have,###matter of fact this past weekend i just got finished *-1 planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs.###so, those ought *-1 to be coming up around spring time.###speakera73.###my wife had, uh, just put in a bunch of, i want *-1 to say, 0 they are *rnr*-2 pansies.###speakerb74.###uh-huh.###speakera75.###she put them in like two months ago cause they are winter plants.###speakerb76.###right.###speakera77.###and they have been,###we thought 0 even with all the cold weather weather 0 we have had *t*-1 they have been blooming just fine.###speakerb78.###oh, they do great.
142279:19	but they make it through probably winter and spring.	probably	###and they just,###they do really good###and i even had, uh, i guess 0 it was *rnr*-1 last year or the year before, i had some out###and it froze###and the pansies looked terrible,###but they came back later.###i didn't do anything to them###so they are, uh, they are good * to plant in the winter time.###they last for a long time then.###so, if you start *-1 putting them, you know, you can put them out in the spring too,###but once it starts *-1 getting real hot then it just kills them cause they can't stand the hot weather.###speakera81.###uh-huh.###speakerb82.###speakera83.###do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter time?###will they make it through the summer sun?###speakerb84.###no,###they won't make it through the summer because it gets too hot,
142413:23	like i said, we are probably as far as you can get from the seven eleven and still be in texas.	probably	###speakera44.###uh-huh.###speakerb45.###we didn't have a phone.###speakera46.###uh-huh.###speakerb47.###they didn't have phone lines.###you just couldn't get phones.###speakera48.###yeah.###speakerb49.###and, uh, we are on the, we are third from the end on the electric string.###speakera50.###uh-huh.###speakerb51.###so, we are at the end of the mail route.###speakera52.###yeah.###speakerb53.
142628:69	i think 0 i am going *-1 to put something like a brown on it, on the outside. and maybe, a little deeper brown *ich*-2 in the entry way or something so it will stand out a little.	maybe	###well, yeah.###i think 0 i am going *-1 to do it this spring actually.###speakera31.###oh really?###speakerb32.###yeah,###there are six houses.###see the people that *t*-1 own the house they, uh, pay for anything like that, that we do *t*-2. as far as the the materials.###speakera33.###oh nice.###speakerb34.###there are three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses.###speakera35.###yeah.###speakerb36.###so, i am thinking 0 i am going *-1 to change it to, uh, something, you know,###the brick is multi color. mostly earth tones.###speakera37.###uh-huh.###speakerb38.
142673:65	but and the only thing 0 i would consider * doing, a professional, maybe doing that,	maybe	###i can't get up high###and we can't paint the chimney.###speakerb52.###well, you have got *-1 to get one of those ladders.###speakera53.###we have one of those ladders.###we are just not willing *-1 to get up that high.###speakerb54.###oh, yeah.###speakera55.###speakerb56.###a friend of mine that *t*-1 lives out in your neighborhood, he has done his house###and that is what he,###i was out there last week###and he has finished everything except the chimney.###speakera57.###well, we did too.###we did it in the fall###and it, it's just too high.###it is really scary,
142735:34	oh, i think 0 that is what we might have *-1 to do *t*-2 with this chimney,	might	###speakerb74.###and literally i wouldn't have done it with the scaffolds because all the places that i had left *t*-1 for him were above huge humongous cactus###speakera75.###it's,###speakerb76.###speakera77.###yeah.###speakerb78.###and if he fell, he was dead###and he knew that.###so,###speakera79.###oh, my.###so that was worth it * getting a professional for that.###speakerb80.###yeah.###speakera81.###speakerb82.###plus, he cleaned up my mess.###speakera83.
142745:10	shoot, maybe a hundred and fifty.	maybe	###so,###speakera79.###oh, my.###so that was worth it * getting a professional for that.###speakerb80.###yeah.###speakera81.###speakerb82.###plus, he cleaned up my mess.###speakera83.###oh, i think 0 that is what we might have *-1 to do *t*-2 with this chimney,###but other than that, it *exp*-1 was pretty easy * doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself.###speakerb84.###uh-huh.###speakera85.###it wasn't too bad.###i mean you think,###speakerb86.###how much did it cost you *t*-1 for the paint for the outside?###speakera87.
142812:23	but i think 0 i will probably just do it, in a roller.	probably	###speakera111.###oh, my word.###speakerb112.###and he saw mumblex.###speakera113.###so that was really worth it. * painting his own house.###speakerb114.###yeah,###it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff.###speakera115.###oh, my word.###speakerb116.###speakera117.###oh, my word.###well, he really saved in that way.###speakerb118.###yeah.###speakera119.###but, yeah,###i think 0 we are going *-1 to do, uh, another bathroom,
142874:22	they're the ones that probably *t*-1 are paying the highest.	probably	###do you know anything about ruben sierra's, uh,###speakera13.###well, i heard tonight on the news that he is willing *-1 to come down. on his,###speakerb14.###yeah###that, he was willing *-1 to come down a little bit and, uh, if the rangers will go up a little bit.###yeah,###speakera15.###speakerb16.###speakera17.###yes.###speakerb18.###speakera19.###and the rangers go up a little bit,###uh-huh.###speakerb20.###but a little bit from three, you know, from thirty million dollars or thirty-five mil-, that's a lot of money.###speakera21.###i think 0 the entire baseball,###yeah,
142923:78	as far as the rangers are concerned *-1, i think, i think 0 they need some, definitely need some pitching.	definitely	###speakera33.###i'm awful sorry 0 he's not still.###speakerb34.###oh, yeah,###but you know, what, he,###that was a great deal for him.###speakera35.###oh, i'm sure 0 it was *?*.###speakerb36.###yeah,###it was a great deal for him### and, and, uh, he just signed on, uh,###i think 0 it was like a five year deal with, uh pittsburgh.###speakera37.###pittsburgh.###speakerb38.###speakera39.###yeah.###speakerb40.###so, you know, he's real happy there.
142972:10	but howse might be a different, uh, situation,	might	###no,###i really don't.###speakerb54.###speakera55.###and i'm not going *-1 to stand up, you know on my, soapbox and say that,###speakerb56.###speakera57.###speakerb58.###speakera59.###but i'm, not fond of howse###speakerb60.###speakera61.###and i'm not fond of grieves.###speakerb62.###oh, tom grieve?###speakera63.###yeah.###speakerb64.###yeah.### i'm, i'm not sure that, um, that they're ready *-1 to get rid *-2 of, of, uh, tom grieve yet,
142973:23	and i think 0 you're probably right, that they, that they need some, you know, some changes in, uh, pitching coach, maybe	probably	###i really don't.###speakerb54.###speakera55.###and i'm not going *-1 to stand up, you know on my, soapbox and say that,###speakerb56.###speakera57.###speakerb58.###speakera59.###but i'm, not fond of howse###speakerb60.###speakera61.###and i'm not fond of grieves.###speakerb62.###oh, tom grieve?###speakera63.###yeah.###speakerb64.###yeah.### i'm, i'm not sure that, um, that they're ready *-1 to get rid *-2 of, of, uh, tom grieve yet,###but howse might be a different, uh, situation,
142973:108	and i think 0 you're probably right, that they, that they need some, you know, some changes in, uh, pitching coach, maybe	maybe	###i really don't.###speakerb54.###speakera55.###and i'm not going *-1 to stand up, you know on my, soapbox and say that,###speakerb56.###speakera57.###speakerb58.###speakera59.###but i'm, not fond of howse###speakerb60.###speakera61.###and i'm not fond of grieves.###speakerb62.###oh, tom grieve?###speakera63.###yeah.###speakerb64.###yeah.### i'm, i'm not sure that, um, that they're ready *-1 to get rid *-2 of, of, uh, tom grieve yet,###but howse might be a different, uh, situation,
143026:32	but, um, i guess 0 my favorite is probably switzerland and ireland.	probably	### so. so, i, i guess 0 those are the types 0 i like *t*-1.###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.###speakera5.###uh-huh.###speakerb6.###we've really enjoyed them.###speakera7.###yeah.###where have you gone *t*-1 there?###speakerb8.###we've gone to, um, germany, switzerland, austria, ireland and england.###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###we've been to germany twice.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.
143233:30	main-, mainly probably because you want *-1 to see everything.	probably	###and over there, you know, every time 0 we'd go and, and eat dinner or lunch or whatever *t*-1 we'd always have *-2 to ask for the check you know###speakera91.###uh-huh.###speakerb92.###speakera93.###yeah.###speakerb94.###they're so leisurely over there###speakera95.###yeah.###speakerb96.###and it *exp*-1's kind of nice * to, to have that.###speakera97.###yeah.###so the type of vacation 0 you'd like *t*-1, um,###like, would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place, or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week?###speakerb98.###well, usually a bunch of different places.###speakera99.###yeah,
143402:11	i'm probably older than you,	probably	###and, uh, you know, everybody says, you know, how many houses *t*-1 are on the market and all that kind of thing###speakera17.### r-, right.###speakerb18.###so we, uh, we look at the paper,###we look at our, talk to our realtor###and you can cut, you know, the listings, uh, in about a third when you go from three to four bedrooms *ich*-1 *t*-2 you know, or five.###speakera19.###sure.###speakerb20.###are you looking###or you settled *-1,###i mean,###speakera21.###no,###we're settled *-1###and, uh we're, uh,###speakerb22.###* h-, having,###speakera23.

144315:42	i mean, of course, * drafting a franchise like him certainly,	certainly	###speakera49.###no.###speakerb50.### it's, you know, it's, it's about the same, uh, same distance *ich*-1 from here to s-, to san antonio as it is *?* from there to sacramento.###speakera51.###is it *?*?###speakerb52.###speakera53.###yeah,###so it's not something 0 you'd drive *t*-1,###speakerb54.###so it's, yeah, it's not really a local, you know,###speakera55.###yeah,###i was thinking 0 maybe david robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing.###speakerb56.###uh, he does a lot of local stuff there in san antonio###and they, i mean, they have got a great club. you know.###speakera57.###they've done a good job.
144352:91	and i think i think 0 jordan and the, and the bulls have *-1 to be, uh, considered *-2 the likely favorites.	likely	###speakera65.###and,###speakerb66.###and, you know, uh, you know, i used *-1 to think that, that one, one player really doesn't make a club,###but it really does, you know.###speakera67.###well, it mumblex,###speakerb68.###you get somebody like magic###and you can see the decline in that team.###speakera69.###well, yeah.###speakerb70.###once he left, you know, it's, it's just not the same, uh, it's not the same team.###there's not the leadership there that they used *-1 to rely on him for *t*-2.###speakera71.###well, i think 0 you're right###and i think 0 isaiah thomas would fit in detroit###and i think 0 those things do make a difference###and there are marquee players.
144406:71	i think 0 they're doing the, is as much research as they can possibly do *?*, you know.	possibly	###speakerb8.###uh, when they asked us did, did we want *-7 to, uh, keep it the same or, uh, spend more, spend less *t*-1, i think uh, i think 0 right now what they're spending *t*-2 is adequate. uh, my, for my personal opinion. uh, because i think 0 it's something that *t*-3's going *-4 to take them a while 0 *-6 to come up with a, uh, vaccine for *t*-5.###speakera9.###yeah.###speakerb10.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###speakera13.###uh-huh.###speakerb14.###i don't think 0 it's going *-1 to be that easy 0 * to come up with *t*-2###speakera15.###yeah.###speakerb16.###or i think 0 they already would have *?* by now, you know.###speakera17.###uh-huh.###speakerb18.### and, uh, so i don't know if, if * spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now.
144417:11	i'm definitely not aware of how much.	definitely	###i don't think 0 it's going *-1 to be that easy 0 * to come up with *t*-2###speakera15.###yeah.###speakerb16.###or i think 0 they already would have *?* by now, you know.###speakera17.###uh-huh.###speakerb18.### and, uh, so i don't know if, if * spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now.###i think 0 they're doing the, is as much research as they can possibly do *?*, you know.###speakera19.###uh-huh.###speakerb20.###and, uh, what about you?###speakera21.###well, i guess 0 i'm not too aware of how much they're spending *t*-1 right now. you know.###speakerb22.###i'm not *?* either.###speakera23.###speakerb24.
144440:99	uh, if, if we were talking about the money, uh, i'd just have *-1 to say 0 what they're spending *t*-2 is probably enough, simply because i don't know that much about it. you know.	probably	###speakerb26.###uh, that's something 0 i've never really kept up with *t*-1 at all.###speakera27.###uh-huh,###yeah.###speakerb28.###uh, i don't, i'm not sure, uh,###speakera29.###i mean, i,###* go ahead.###speakerb30.###i know, uh, 0 i've always thought more about the disease rather than the der-, research,###you know what i mean *t*-1?###speakera31.###uh-huh.###speakerb32.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###and, uh, that sort of thing.
144483:11	it's definitely not *?*.	definitely	###speakera45.###speakerb46.###yeah.###speakera47.###speakerb48.###well, that's true.###that's true because, uh, it's a, such an easily preventable disease.###speakera49.###speakerb50.###speakera51.###right,###and i, i feel like *-1 just saying, uh, safe sex is not the answer.###speakerb52.###uh,###speakera53.### it's it's, uh abstinence in certain cases###speakerb54.###no.###speakera55.###speakerb56.
144525:27	and, uh, i mean, it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry.	certainly	###speakera67.###uh-huh.###speakerb68.###and, uh, because you never know what *t*-1's going *-2 to happen.###you don't know who you're going *-1 to come across *t*-2, you know.###speakera69.###yeah.###speakerb70.###course, it's, it's not that i'm wanting * to, i'm not going *-1 to want *-2 to go and have sex with everybody 0 i see *t*-3.###speakera71.###uh-huh.###speakerb72.###but it's something 0 you got *-1 to think about *t*-2 these days.###speakera73.###yeah.###speakerb74.###a single person. you know,###speakera75.###uh-huh.###speakerb76.
144597:33	i mean, i, i definitely think that it's the drug problem that *t*-1 needs *-2 to be addressed *-3,	definitely	###i'm not too a-, much against the, the passing out of the free syringes myself.###speakera103.###uh-huh.###speakerb104.###i don't know,###what do you think *t*-1 about that?###speakera105.###well, yeah,###boy that's a hard issue.###speakerb106.### it, it really is *?*.###speakera107.###speakerb108.###speakera109.###it really is *?*.###speakerb110.###it really is *?*.###they gave us a hard topic.###speakera111.###yeah.
144675:10	but it probably takes a lot.	probably	###i've heard, you know, uh different voices speaking up and saying 0 we're not spending enough###speakerb140.###yeah.###speakera141.###speakerb142.###yeah.###speakera143.###and, mostly that's what i've heard *t*-1,###speakerb144.###right,###sure.###speakera145.###so i don't know,###speakerb146.###yeah.###speakera147.###and, yet, i know 0 it's, uh, it sounds like big money to me.###speakerb148.###yeah###speakera149.
144932:8	you probably, uh, more up on this subject than i am *?*,	probably	###speakerb96.###uh-huh.###speakera97.###big time there,###* sure is *?*.###speakerb98.###it surely is *?*.###speakera99.###i don't think 0 i'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself mumblex.###speakerb100.###well, i'm careful.###speakera101.###gee-,###that's the worst neighborhood in the whole c-, area.###speakerb102.###yeah,###it's, uh, a little scary sometimes###and, uh, i manage the,###speakera1.###okay.
145018:17	so, they certainly, uh, they certainly deserve it all the way.	certainly	###absolutely.###speakerb24.###it's, you know,###speakera25.###you know, i've,###speakerb26.###and you hear some people say, you know, well, he's a man,### he, he, he needs that salary.###speakera27.###right.###speakerb28.###speakera29.###yeah,###they forget.###also, i think, uh, 0 a good argument for that is in the area of politics, you know,###if a,###a woman congressman i'm sure 0 *t*-1 makes as much as a man congressman as, and the same as a senator or whatever.###speakerb30.###right.###speakera31.
145018:33	so, they certainly, uh, they certainly deserve it all the way.	certainly	###absolutely.###speakerb24.###it's, you know,###speakera25.###you know, i've,###speakerb26.###and you hear some people say, you know, well, he's a man,### he, he, he needs that salary.###speakera27.###right.###speakerb28.###speakera29.###yeah,###they forget.###also, i think, uh, 0 a good argument for that is in the area of politics, you know,###if a,###a woman congressman i'm sure 0 *t*-1 makes as much as a man congressman as, and the same as a senator or whatever.###speakerb30.###right.###speakera31.
145063:18	you know, she certainly did her part in * help *-1 getting me establishing in my business	certainly	###speakera39.###you bet.###speakerb40.###speakera41.###good point.###speakerb42.###and if they're out there *-1 buying that many cars, then there's that many out that *t*-2 are self sufficient and, you know, mobile and working.###speakera43.###right now i'm self employed### and, and my wife's always worked.###she's a schoolteacher,###but for,###she started *-1 working###and then when i first started my business *t*-1, uh,###she was selling real estate at the time###and hers was the only income 0 we had *t*-1 for three or four months###so,###speakerb44.###right.###speakera45.
145165:10	uh, probably. uh,	probably	###speakerb16.###are you *?*?###where are a student *t*-1?###speakera17.###uh,###speakerb18.###speakera19.###uh, university of southern mississippi.###speakerb20.###no kidding.###speakera21.###uh, she's,###speakerb22.###i was a professor in a university here in california for a while.###speakera23.###yeah.###speakerb24.###yeah,###uh, are you going *-1 to, uh, put your son in child care in a, a year or two?###speakera25.
145166:99	actually spring semester a year from now he's going *-1 to have *-2 to be in child care f-, uh, five days a week more than likely. uh, depending on how my class schedule runs *t*-3	likely	###are you *?*?###where are a student *t*-1?###speakera17.###uh,###speakerb18.###speakera19.###uh, university of southern mississippi.###speakerb20.###no kidding.###speakera21.###uh, she's,###speakerb22.###i was a professor in a university here in california for a while.###speakera23.###yeah.###speakerb24.###yeah,###uh, are you going *-1 to, uh, put your son in child care in a, a year or two?###speakera25.###uh, probably. uh,
145220:18	they've been here probably thirty, forty years.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakerb40.###and what we found, uh, *t*-1 to be the best guide was our own instincts about, people who *t*-2 were going *-3 to be loving###speakera41.###speakerb42.###speakera43.###yeah.###speakerb44.###and, uh, that's more important than anything else.###we could have sent, uh, her to a fancier, uh, facility.###speakera45.###uh-huh.###speakerb46.###uh, she goes to a home.###this is a, uh, a couple, uh, 0 *t*-1 emigrated from china early in, in their lives.###speakera47.###speakerb48.###speakera49.###uh-huh.###speakerb50.
145462:44	but i can, i can under-, certainly understand where,	certainly	###and i'm thinking what *ich*-3 did i get *t*-1, that *t*-2 costs so much.###speakerb40.###surprising.###speakera41.###speakerb42.###speakera43.###speakerb44.###yeah.###speakera45.###and,###speakerb46.###well, you know, but the,###speakera47.###speakerb48.###i mean, there are sort some inherent limits there,### you're not going * to, you're not going *-1 to run up a few thousand dollars for that,###right.###speakera49.###yeah,### that, that's true,
145469:19	the thing that *t*-1 probably helps me most *-2 doing that is really, you know, uh, not so much discipline,	probably	###yeah.###speakera45.###and,###speakerb46.###well, you know, but the,###speakera47.###speakerb48.###i mean, there are sort some inherent limits there,### you're not going * to, you're not going *-1 to run up a few thousand dollars for that,###right.###speakera49.###yeah,### that, that's true,###but i can, i can under-, certainly understand where,###speakerb50.###now i,###speakera51.###you know,###speakerb52.###w-,
145569:8	i might,	might	###right.###speakera89.###speakerb90.###yeah.###speakera91.###and i, i guess 0 there's some, there's, uh, uh, some negotiating there, too,###because i heard, uh,###on one of the local talk shows here, they had somebody on and, and said, what you can do *t*-1 is, uh, * call, you know,###if you've got a pretty good rating, uh, credit rating you can call your in-, you know, your, your card, wherever you got your card from *t*-1 and tell them, hey, * either drop my rates or drop my, you know, uh annual fees###or i'll just go to somewhere else.###speakerb92.###uh-huh.###speakera93.###speakerb94.###right.###speakera95.###speakerb96.###high,###speakera97.###speakerb98.
145579:13	um, i might try that because i, i have one card that i've had *t*-1 for about, uh, i don't know, nine or ten years.	might	###speakerb92.###uh-huh.###speakera93.###speakerb94.###right.###speakera95.###speakerb96.###high,###speakera97.###speakerb98.###i might,###speakera99.###you know, and if you've got, if you've got a pretty good uh, uh, history with them they're more than willing * to do that.###speakerb100.###um.###speakera101.###speakerb102.###right.###speakera103.###speakerb104.
145751:54	i'm, i'm quite a bit, i'm probably a lot older than you are *?*.	probably	###they're really kind of fascinating.###i found out 0 my grandmother was one of a twin.###speakera44.###oh.###speakerb45.###and we don't even know where the twin,###we have virtually no, no background on, on her on the twin.###speakera46.###really?###speakerb47.###speakera48.###is it your, your grandma's own sibling###and she,###speakerb49.###my grandmother's, uh, sister who *t*-1 would be somewhere in, in west virginia.###i'm sure 0 she's, you know, dead now, because my grandmother died in, about twenty years ago.###speakera50.###oh, i see.###oh so,###speakerb51.
145754:10	well, maybe, uh, they just moved away and then sort of lost contact.	maybe	###oh.###speakerb45.###and we don't even know where the twin,###we have virtually no, no background on, on her on the twin.###speakera46.###really?###speakerb47.###speakera48.###is it your, your grandma's own sibling###and she,###speakerb49.###my grandmother's, uh, sister who *t*-1 would be somewhere in, in west virginia.###i'm sure 0 she's, you know, dead now, because my grandmother died in, about twenty years ago.###speakera50.###oh, i see.###oh so,###speakerb51.### i'm, i'm quite a bit, i'm probably a lot older than you are *?*.###uh,###speakera52.
145903:45	and the way 0 medical expenses are *t*-4 i think 0 that's probably one of the biggest benefits * to ha-, 0 you need *-2 to have *t*-3.	probably	###speakerb60.###i think 0 today the thing that i, uh, would appreciate *t*-1 the most,###uh, because my husband gets, his medical through his company,###speakera61.###speakerb62.###but we have *-1 to pay for mine###speakera63.###uh-huh.###speakerb64.###and we're the only one, i'm the only one that *t*-1's being insured *-2### and and we pay the same amount that someone over there that *t*-1 has four children has *t*-2, i mean,###speakera65.###oh, is that right?###speakerb66.###so it's kind of,###speakera67.###yeah.###speakerb68.###and i would,###i really,
145993:8	plus probably an additional six months through the, the worker's stuff that they have *t*-1 at, at, uh, through the company	probably	###oh, really?###speakerb100.###yes,###they come in there,###just, they go off *-1 fishing and stuff and come in and, every friday, and go to the safety deposit box,###and i'm sitting there *-1 making a hundred dollars a week, you know### and, and they had all these gr-,###speakera101.###is that right?###speakerb102.### i, i really believe 0 they have done this to themselves, in a way, because of the unions being so stocked.###speakera103.###the union,###yeah.###speakerb104.###and right now, anybody's that *t*-1's laid *-2 off from g m will have a full year's paycheck.###i just read this in the paper the other day.###speakera105.###is that right?###speakerb106.
146239:24	i think 0 gluing alone, certainly if you wash it any amount of time, it tends *-1 to kind of come loose at the edges.	certainly	###but when i washed them *t*-1, although i took the precaution of *-2 turning them inside out i really didn't do anything else. and truly, everything *ich*-3 fell off, or most of it.###speakera61.###oh, sure.###speakerb62.###speakera63.###uh-huh.###speakerb64.###speakera65.###oh, really.###speakerb66.###so i had, i went and bought just some cloth glue and glued it all back###and i bought the paint and redid most of the edges###speakera67.###oh.###speakerb68.### and, and it was salvageable,###and i,###but it's,###so i'm familiar with that,###but i think 0 you're very clever *-1 to, um, sew around the edges.
146432:14	i like colombo probably the best of any of those mystery things.	probably	###but it seems like there's only about four or five different ones,###and then, then they keep *-1 showing them over and over.###speakera61.###oh, i guess 0 i've, i haven't seen it before.###speakerb62.###he was a movie director,###and he had that gal killed *-1.###speakera63.###yeah###speakerb64.###okay.###speakera65.###yeah,###on the set or something.###speakerb66.###that was pretty good though.###speakera67.###yeah,###it was *?*.###but, yeah,
146512:8	we might as well *?*.	might	###speakerb4.###hi,###my name is pat johnson###and i live in te-, texas too.###speakera5.###okay,###i work for t i,### do, do you also?###speakerb6.###no.###speakera7.###okay.###speakerb8.###no,###i live in dallas.###i work for the dallas school system.###speakera9.###oh, okay.###uh, you ready * to begin?###speakerb10.
146643:13	well, i definitely think that we need *-1 to start *-2 recycling.	definitely	###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###speakera61.###speakerb62.###yes.###speakera63.### what, what do you call alzheimer disease and stuff like that *t*-1###speakerb64.###yes,###alzheimer,###yes.###speakera65.###and they don't, don't, uh, they weren't really together with the rest of them, when they got together for such activities *t*-1.###speakerb66.###yes###and that can,###speakerb1.###okay,###so now what are your opinions on recycling *t*-1?###speakera2.
146936:12	it *exp*-1 might kill you * to go up and, walk up to the door	might	###speakera13.###um, when i was a teacher, um, in utah *t*-1, i would generally wear, um, dresses and heels and things like that,###speakerb14.###uh-huh.###speakera15.###and even when it, um, rained and snowed *t*-1 i just braved it###and i wore heels anyway.###speakerb16.###yeah.###speakera17.###and,###speakerb18.### i, i can see,### i, i've been a teacher###so has my daughter *?*###and i know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that, it was tiring.###speakera19.###i know,###speakerb20.###speakera21.
146997:16	of course, you probably wear coats a lot.	probably	###they're not a cowboy boot,###but they're just a real pretty boot,###but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain.###speakera35.###oh.###speakerb36.###as i have a private high school that i run *t*-1 here and so when i'm interviewing a parent *t*-3, of course i feel like i need *-2 to wear heels you know, and look like i'm a business person. you know, because the children will tease about where's your motorcycle *t*-4, if you wear boots too often, you know.###speakera37.###sure.###uh-huh.###speakerb38.###speakera39.###uh-huh.###yeah.###speakerb40.###speakera41.###speakerb42.###speakera43.###huh. well, um,###speakerb44.
147023:27	we have a few days 0 you might wear a coat, winter coat, *t*-1 you know,	might	###oh, my goodness###so then you had *-1 to *?*.###speakera47.###yeah,###and then the third year we, um, got heating###so it was nice.###speakerb48.###yes.###then things improved,###right?###speakera49.###right,###uh-huh.###speakerb50.###but of course, here we wear a light weight jacket a lot you know, you know,###speakera51.###oh, that's nice.###speakerb52.###and, uh, that's very seldom### we, it depends upon our winter.
147116:24	i think 0 the automobile *ich*-2 definitely is an area and any, any industry that *t*-1 burns, you know,	definitely	###i hear that the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars###and low polluting fuels *ich*-2 are being experimented with *-1 ethanol and other types of fuels.###speakera2.###yeah,###one of the things 0 they asked me *-1 to ask you *t*-2 was where you thought 0 the major source *ich*-4 was coming from *t*-3? or sources.###speakerb3.### i, you know, i assume, that the major sources are cars and factories.###speakera4.###speakerb5.###speakera6.###that's what, i would think *t*-1.###speakerb7.###but i, i don't know for sure.###speakera8.###speakerb9.###i just know that, um, acid rain apparently is a big problem in canada from, would###* comes over the border from us.###speakera10.###right.###yeah,
147159:33	i think 0 something *ich*-2 too that you probably see *t*-3 in older states, all we, we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces *t*-1.	probably	###yeah,### that is, well that's destroying the ozone, isn't it *?*?###speakerb19.###again i, that's what i hear *t*-1### and, and there's this big debate *ich*-1 apparently about whether the ozone, there's a hole in the ozone or not###but at last 0 i heard *t*-1 it was, uh, discovered *-2 that the hole was bigger than they thought, initially *?*.###speakera20.###yeah,###that's wh-,###speakerb21.###speakera22.###it's kind of scary.###speakerb23.###well, it is scary###and i think 0 it will, uh, continue *-1 to force us to clean up our act, literally and figuratively.###speakera24.###yeah.###speakerb25.###we've got *-1 to learn *-2 to manage without *-3 destroying the environment.###speakera26.
147385:13	what she probably would do *t*-1 is * disburse the money to me	probably	###right.###speakerb36.### it, it takes every penny.###they want you to spend every dime 0 you have *t*-1 before the government will pay for your your care.###speakera37.###yeah.###speakerb38.###speakera39.###right.###speakerb40.###and that's the sad part about it.###speakera41.###yeah.###i, uh,###yeah,###and i think 0 a lot of people who *t*-1 do it now.###in colorado it's interesting.###i talked to my mother.###they allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home.###and my mother could make it on that.
147728:23	uh, i think 0 it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody *t*-1.	probably	###schroeder's about the biggest one in washington.###speakerb96.###uh-huh.###speakera97.###congress woman.###and, uh, other th-, uh,###we really,###speakera1.###okay.###i think 0 the first thing 0 they said *t*-1,###i have written this down###so it would,### is it p-, do you think 0 it *exp*-1's possible * to have honesty in government or an honest government?###speakerb2.###okay.###you're asking what my opinion about, whether it *exp*-1's possible * to have honesty in government *t*-2.###speakera3.###yeah.###speakerb4.###well, i suspect that it is possible.
147728:31	uh, i think 0 it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody *t*-1.	likely	###schroeder's about the biggest one in washington.###speakerb96.###uh-huh.###speakera97.###congress woman.###and, uh, other th-, uh,###we really,###speakera1.###okay.###i think 0 the first thing 0 they said *t*-1,###i have written this down###so it would,### is it p-, do you think 0 it *exp*-1's possible * to have honesty in government or an honest government?###speakerb2.###okay.###you're asking what my opinion about, whether it *exp*-1's possible * to have honesty in government *t*-2.###speakera3.###yeah.###speakerb4.###well, i suspect that it is possible.
147733:33	but, uh, other than that i think 0 maybe it just depends on how you define honesty *t*-1.	maybe	###and, uh, other th-, uh,###we really,###speakera1.###okay.###i think 0 the first thing 0 they said *t*-1,###i have written this down###so it would,### is it p-, do you think 0 it *exp*-1's possible * to have honesty in government or an honest government?###speakerb2.###okay.###you're asking what my opinion about, whether it *exp*-1's possible * to have honesty in government *t*-2.###speakera3.###yeah.###speakerb4.###well, i suspect that it is possible.###uh, i think 0 it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody *t*-1.###speakera5.###right.###that's a good point.###speakerb6.
147755:31	and personally i feel 0 it's probably, there's probably some of each.	probably	### that's an int-, you know, that's interesting.###i had read something one time###and it was just applying to governments in general,###it was written *-1 many years ago.###it said that it *exp*-2's impossible * to have a completely honest system of government because people who *t*-1 choose government for their positions are power seekers.###and i thought 0 that was interesting.###it wasn't just talking about our government.###it was just government in general. from times past, you know on###speakerb8.###uh-huh.###speakera9.###and,###speakerb10.###so they're saying that government officials would tend *-1 to be power seekers.###speakera11.###right.###and that would be a next question 0 * to ask *t*-1.###how many do you think 0 *t*-1 are in there for pub-, for bu-,###because they want *-1 to be a service to us###or are they in there for their own gains,
147755:45	and personally i feel 0 it's probably, there's probably some of each.	probably	### that's an int-, you know, that's interesting.###i had read something one time###and it was just applying to governments in general,###it was written *-1 many years ago.###it said that it *exp*-2's impossible * to have a completely honest system of government because people who *t*-1 choose government for their positions are power seekers.###and i thought 0 that was interesting.###it wasn't just talking about our government.###it was just government in general. from times past, you know on###speakerb8.###uh-huh.###speakera9.###and,###speakerb10.###so they're saying that government officials would tend *-1 to be power seekers.###speakera11.###right.###and that would be a next question 0 * to ask *t*-1.###how many do you think 0 *t*-1 are in there for pub-, for bu-,###because they want *-1 to be a service to us###or are they in there for their own gains,

147772:19	the president of general motors probably has the same,	probably	###how many do you think 0 *t*-1 are in there for pub-, for bu-,###because they want *-1 to be a service to us###or are they in there for their own gains,###and personally i feel 0 it's probably, there's probably some of each.###speakerb12.###right.###yeah.###but i think 0 maybe a lot of them, um,###say the more honest ones who *t*-2 are still looking out for themselves, it may be more matter of not what can i steal *t*-1 while in an office but how many friends can i make *t*-3 while, i'm in office.###speakera13.###uh-huh.###speakerb14.###speakera15.###yeah.###speakerb16.###and, you know, how good a name can i make *t*-1 for myself and so forth.###so i guess 0 it would be like anything else.###speakera17.###yeah.###speakerb18.
147911:47	well, i have *-1 to say 0 my favorite type of music would probably be, uh, classical music.	probably	###yeah.###speakerb66.###so, uh,###speakera67.###yeah,###i still believe 0 i get very fed up with government sometimes###but when i think about where i'd want *-1 to go *t*-2 *t*-3, you know, this is still the best###or i can,###speakerb68.###yeah,###i've been around to a few other countries###and i, uh, i, i have not found one *ich*-1 yet that i would rather live in *t*-2.###i think, uh,###speakera69.###yeah.###yeah,###at its worst i think 0 we've got the best.###speakera1.###well, uh, what is your favorite kind of music *t*-1?###speakerb2.
147968:30	so, i'd say, 0 vivaldi is probably my favorite, uh, composer.	probably	###so you, you figure out what *t*-1's going on after a while,###and then you can enjoy it in the, uh, theater.###speakerb18.###oh.###speakera19.###but, you know, the, uh, dallas opera now has, uh, super titles on, on all their performances i think 0 *t*-1.###speakerb20.###what is that *t*-1?###speakera21.###well, they, they give an, uh, an english translation on a, on a screen up above the stage.###speakerb22.###oh, i didn't know that.###speakera23.###yeah.###speakerb24.###that can help people like me.###speakera25.###in fact, they even do that for operas sung, sung * in english, because it *exp*-1 is hard * to understand the words sometimes.###speakerb26.###well, i can understand that.
147974:23	uh, he's, uh, definitely one of the, one of the top of that era.	definitely	###speakerb20.###what is that *t*-1?###speakera21.###well, they, they give an, uh, an english translation on a, on a screen up above the stage.###speakerb22.###oh, i didn't know that.###speakera23.###yeah.###speakerb24.###that can help people like me.###speakera25.###in fact, they even do that for operas sung, sung * in english, because it *exp*-1 is hard * to understand the words sometimes.###speakerb26.###well, i can understand that.###so, i'd say, 0 vivaldi is probably my favorite, uh, composer.###speakera27.###speakerb28.###speakera29.###yeah,###well, i really like vivaldi.
148143:6	more likely *-1 to see those at a ski show or something,	likely	###speakera7.###oh, good.###that's a good one, 0 i like *-1 to get *t*-2.###um, so i take it that you like *-1 to ski.### do you, do you, um, receive a lot of information on skiing through the ski magazine?###speakerb8.###i presume that i do.###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###uh, i suppose 0 that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth, because i do get things from ski associations and things, uh, at, during the year.###speakera11.###oh.###speakerb12.###speakera13.###oh, uh, and do you receive discounts and things like that, do you think###or,###speakerb14.###uh, not so much that,###i, uh,
148353:97	i, uh, i don't think 0 i've ever met a type of music 0 i don't like *t*-1 except for, uh, maybe, you know, heavy metal and that.	maybe	###favorite type of music or musician or any.###speakerb2.###i don't really have a favorite type.###i like, uh, a lot of different types of music.###speakera3.###do you?###speakerb4.###yeah,###i have a, a tape collection that i like *-1 to listen to *t*-2, uh, cassette tapes###speakera5.###uh-huh.###speakerb6.###but it's pretty varied.###speakera7.###uh-huh.###speakerb8.###yeah.###how about you?###speakera9.###oh, i, i'm very, uh, i'm very varied as well.
148387:57	but i, i like *-1 to listen to, uh, what you might call *t*-2 pop, easy listening country western, jazz uh, classical, um,	might	###i don't enjoy rap too much, either.### that, that doesn't appeal to, uh, my ears.###speakerb16.###well, as far as the rap goes, i think 0 there are a few artists that *t*-1 appeal to me themselves###speakera17.###uh-huh.###speakerb18.###speakera19.###uh-huh.###speakerb20.###and i like some of their songs.###speakera21.###oh.###speakerb22.###but as, as###i agree,###with the general rule, i, i wouldn't choose rap either.###speakera23.###uh-huh.###speakerb24.
148424:8	you might try that.	might	###speakerb34.###i really love *-1 to listen to her,###speakera35.###uh-huh.###speakerb36.###and, uh, i even have a, a tape of lady smith blackman bazo###speakera37.###oh, gosh.###speakerb38.###and, well, i mean, they're very harmonic###speakera39.###uh-huh###speakerb40.###they really are *?*.###speakera41.###uh-huh,###yeah,###sure.###speakerb42.###so, they're interesting 0 * to listen to *t*-1.
148428:22	most, most likely i would be listen to, uh, jazz or classical music.	likely	###speakerb36.###and, uh, i even have a, a tape of lady smith blackman bazo###speakera37.###oh, gosh.###speakerb38.###and, well, i mean, they're very harmonic###speakera39.###uh-huh###speakerb40.###they really are *?*.###speakera41.###uh-huh,###yeah,###sure.###speakerb42.###so, they're interesting 0 * to listen to *t*-1.###you might try that.###how about you?###speakera43.###well, um, i listen to, uh, specific,
148712:37	oh, well that's that'ud probably give you a smoother finish, wouldn't it *?*?	probably	###i use just a wood sealer.###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb30.###yeah.###speakera31.###i just bought a spray gun, one of those airless, uh, not airless, high volume, low pressure spray guns.###speakerb32.###oh, uh-huh.###speakera33.###and i do a lot of woodworking###and that's what i bought it for *t*-1.###speakerb34.###do you?###speakera35.###speakerb36.###oh.###speakera37.###but i haven't used it yet.###speakerb38.
148843:11	you're probably a veteran at this.	probably	###uh,###speakera87.###speakerb88.###yeah.###speakera89.###speakerb90.###yeah,###so, it's fun.###speakera91.###good.###well, i guess 0 i'll let you go now.###speakerb92.###well, they come on,###we're supposed *-1 to talk until they come on and tell us.###speakera93.###oh, they do?###speakerb94.###speakera95.###okay,###so this is my first one.
149042:11	i'm probably eventually going *-1 to get a three eighty-six.	probably	###speakerb54.###yeah,###okay,###bye-bye.###speakera55.###bye.###speakera1.###do you have a p c?###speakerb2.###yes,###i have a macintosh s e thirty.###speakera3.###uh-huh.###yeah,###a lot of my friends are into macintoshes.###i have a, um, p c, a i b m p c myself.###speakerb4.###uh-huh.###speakera5.###a two eighty-six.
149219:15	i think 0 probably when i get system seven *t*-1 i may have *-2 to do that and, and get another, possibly another hard disk.	probably	###speakera71.### there's, i remember that there was one game that i played *t*-1 that *t*-2 required forty-eight k###and there was only one computer that *t*-1 had forty-eight k on it at the time.###speakerb72.###uh-huh.###speakera73.###and you know it *exp*-1's just so amazing that generally, you know, if you, if you,###i'm not sure about macintoshes,###but i know 0 i b m --s, you, you generally, you know, you buy a megabyte at a time.###speakerb74.###uh-huh.###speakera75.###you know, that's, that's your low-, that's the low end.###uh.###speakerb76.###well the s p thirty goes up to eight###speakera77.###uh-huh.###speakerb78.###but i haven't upgraded it quite that far yet.
149219:91	i think 0 probably when i get system seven *t*-1 i may have *-2 to do that and, and get another, possibly another hard disk.	possibly	###speakera71.### there's, i remember that there was one game that i played *t*-1 that *t*-2 required forty-eight k###and there was only one computer that *t*-1 had forty-eight k on it at the time.###speakerb72.###uh-huh.###speakera73.###and you know it *exp*-1's just so amazing that generally, you know, if you, if you,###i'm not sure about macintoshes,###but i know 0 i b m --s, you, you generally, you know, you buy a megabyte at a time.###speakerb74.###uh-huh.###speakera75.###you know, that's, that's your low-, that's the low end.###uh.###speakerb76.###well the s p thirty goes up to eight###speakera77.###uh-huh.###speakerb78.###but i haven't upgraded it quite that far yet.
149402:10	oh, definitely.	definitely	###speakerb62.###i think 0 a lot of people are panicked *-1, how kids are turning out *t*-4 and how things are going for kids *t*-5 and realizing 0 they've got *-2 to start *-3 doing something.###so.###speakera63.###yes,### that's, that's true.###well, we see that a lot out here in utah,###and, um, hopefully, hopefully it's going *-1 to spread, huh. mumblex.###speakerb64.###utah's a lot better than texas.###speakera65.###oh.###um, do you have a lot of large families out there in texas,###or.###speakerb66.###very few.###speakera67.###very few.###you feel like you're in the minority?###speakerb68.
149480:18	um, he's probably, oh, a good two years old, big, old, fat and sassy tabby.	probably	###yeah.###speakera1.###okay, um, chuck, do you have any pets there at your home?###speakerb2.###yeah,###i do.###speakera3.###and what kind do you have *t*-1?###speakerb4.###i've got a male siamese about a year old here.###i live alone in an apartment, and, uh, except for the cat.###speakera5.###uh-huh.###speakerb6.###speakera7.###uh-huh.###speakerb8.###how about you?###speakera9.###well, we have a cat,
149665:45	it's on, i think 0 *t*-1, two or three nights for maybe an hour or two	maybe	###speakera73.###oh.###speakerb74.###did you see the, the c n n, the, the dog show, uh,###speakera75.###huh-uh,### we don't have c, we don't have cable.###speakerb76.###i see.###well they have, uh, uh, a wesmin-, they call it *rnr*-1 the westminster dog show, uh,###i think 0 it's in new york city at the, at the gardens###there once a year live###speakera77.###oh.###speakerb78.###and they had that on last week,###and that's really kind of something 0 * to watch *t*-1, uh,###speakera79.###oh.###speakerb80.
149771:79	especially the democratic candidates don't seem *-1 to be coming up with much that *t*-2 really sparks my interest as far as yeah, maybe that could do something 0 *t*-3 to affect our budget at this point.	maybe	###speakerb12.###uh-huh.###speakera13.###another ninety-seven cents,###hell you can buy a coke or something for that.###speakerb14.###yeah,###i mean, mostly it's, it's not actually a, a, a cut,###it's just a cut in the withhold, in the amount withheld *, you know.###speakera15.###yeah.###speakerb16.###um, yeah###i don't see this mumblex changing my lifestyle a whole lot.###speakera17.###that ninety-seven cents really isn't going *-1 to do it for me either.###speakerb18.###huh-uh.###speakera19.###uh, i, i haven't really heard much of what the other people, other candidates have said *t*-1 that *t*-2 have made a lot of sense to me either,
149982:8	and probably, um, they need *-1 to try *-2 to increase community involvement, that sort of thing, i think 0 *t*-3 mumblex.	probably	###uh. uh, i think 0 it is bad in certain areas,###speakera7.###uh.###speakerb8.###however i think, 0 the area that i live in *t*-1 it's not, uh, the crime level is not as high as it is *?* in other areas of the, of the city.###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###i think 0 it seems that there's certain areas where, uh, the crime is focused *-1 *t*-2 uh.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###speakera13.###well what do you think 0 *t*-1 can be done *-2 about the crime in the city?###speakerb14.###well, i think 0 it's, what *t*-1's been happening over the last several years it seems 0 they've been beefing up the police patrols, trying *-2 to put, put more guys, more cops, higher visibility,###and, uh, they've had some impact, but not a tremendous amount,###speakera15.###uh-huh.###speakerb16.
149984:8	i probably agree with that.	probably	###uh.###speakerb8.###however i think, 0 the area that i live in *t*-1 it's not, uh, the crime level is not as high as it is *?* in other areas of the, of the city.###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###i think 0 it seems that there's certain areas where, uh, the crime is focused *-1 *t*-2 uh.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###speakera13.###well what do you think 0 *t*-1 can be done *-2 about the crime in the city?###speakerb14.###well, i think 0 it's, what *t*-1's been happening over the last several years it seems 0 they've been beefing up the police patrols, trying *-2 to put, put more guys, more cops, higher visibility,###and, uh, they've had some impact, but not a tremendous amount,###speakera15.###uh-huh.###speakerb16.###and probably, um, they need *-1 to try *-2 to increase community involvement, that sort of thing, i think 0 *t*-3 mumblex.###speakera17.
149998:11	that's probably true.	probably	###and, uh, they've had some impact, but not a tremendous amount,###speakera15.###uh-huh.###speakerb16.###and probably, um, they need *-1 to try *-2 to increase community involvement, that sort of thing, i think 0 *t*-3 mumblex.###speakera17.###i probably agree with that.###speakerb18.###yeah.###speakera19.###uh.###speakerb20.###you know, particularly in some of the housing projects, uh, you know, that's, that tends *-1 to be where a lot of that crime is focused *-2 *t*-3###speakera21.###uh-huh.###speakerb22.###and they've got *-1 to do more than * just having, having cops there.###they've got *-1 to kind of change the way 0 people think *t*-2 about it.###speakera23.###yeah,
150002:43	i'd say 0 it's, it's probably in the top, top ten in terms of crime.	probably	###and probably, um, they need *-1 to try *-2 to increase community involvement, that sort of thing, i think 0 *t*-3 mumblex.###speakera17.###i probably agree with that.###speakerb18.###yeah.###speakera19.###uh.###speakerb20.###you know, particularly in some of the housing projects, uh, you know, that's, that tends *-1 to be where a lot of that crime is focused *-2 *t*-3###speakera21.###uh-huh.###speakerb22.###and they've got *-1 to do more than * just having, having cops there.###they've got *-1 to kind of change the way 0 people think *t*-2 about it.###speakera23.###yeah,###that's probably true.###um, so, um, well do you think 0 atlanta's as bad as most other cities?###speakerb24.###um, well, i've been to,
150109:7	so maybe that counts.	maybe	###speakera61.###yeah,###i've been pretty lucky about * getting mugged *-1.###um. yeah,###speakerb62.###oh, yeah.###speakera63.###i think 0 i've only actually seen like one, you know, one actual robbery with a gun###speakerb64.###um.###speakera65.###and that's been about the only, you know, real violent crime where, you know, potentially violent crime that i've seen *t*-2 in atlanta.###speakerb66.###really,###well, i've had my.###speakera67.###and that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed *t*-1.###speakerb68.###uh-huh.###i've had my car stolen *-1,
150153:15	well, you're probably luckier than.	probably	### i've actually, i've known, known some people that *t*-1 have had their cars stolen *-2.###uh, and, uh, and, you know, about half the time they seem *-1 to, the a p d seems *-2 to recover them, you know in various states of disrepair. up on blocks.###speakerb78.###right.###speakera79.###speakerb80.###yeah###speakera81.###my friend had a v w rabbit,###and when he, when he got it back *t*-1 his, um, dashboard was sitting in the front seat.###speakerb82.###yeah,### mine was just, it had been wrecked *-1###and some superficial type damage,###but they didn't, they didn't strip it###speakera83.###uh-huh.###speakerb84.###so i got it back.###speakera85.
150236:29	i didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than,	probably	###no.###speakera11.###yeah,###we just moved into a new house, too,###so we had *-1 to buy all those, too.###speakerb12.###uh, * watch out.###speakera13.###yeah,###the only thing 0 i've had problems with *t*-1 is, um,###i buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail###speakerb14.###uh-huh.###speakera15.###and i bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it's nontoxic and such *t*-1,###and when you get the product *t*-1 it ends up *-2 being toxic and all these warnings.###so.###speakerb16.###um.###speakera17.
150517:76	i would think that that type of employment, you're, you're, one day you might be really tuned in and the next day, oh, a little luke warm or something	might	###and i don't know who *t*-1 looks forward to it more, the students or the teachers and the staff.###speakera51.###uh-huh.###speakerb52.###speakera53.###right.###speakerb54.###what do you do *t*-1 there?###speakera55.###well, um, i'm not actually on the teaching faculty,###but we have a large research organization associated * with the university,###and that's who i work with *t*-1.###speakerb56.###okay.###speakera57.###um, and we're given *-2, you know, a good bit of flexibility in what we do *t*-1.###we can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study *t*-1.###speakerb58.###well, that's good.###yeah,
150551:11	those are probably the two main things 0 i like *-1 to do *t*-2.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakerb64.###that's the only reason 0 i work there *t*-1, is that my children now have graduated, and graduated from college###but at the time, i worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs###speakera65.###oh, yeah.###speakerb66.###speakera67.###uh-huh.###speakerb68.###and, uh, i've just continued *-1 to, uh, stay there mumblex.###speakera69.### are there, are there any things that, that you'd like *-1 to see *t*-2 changed *-3 in terms of the, the benefits?###speakera1.###okay,###martin, do you do any exercise?###speakerb2.###yes,###i do.###uh, i like *-1 to, uh, play basketball and weight lifting.
150560:93	um, in, in, in the winter, you, typically it's, it's probably too cold * to go out and do things like tennis.	probably	###speakerb68.###and, uh, i've just continued *-1 to, uh, stay there mumblex.###speakera69.### are there, are there any things that, that you'd like *-1 to see *t*-2 changed *-3 in terms of the, the benefits?###speakera1.###okay,###martin, do you do any exercise?###speakerb2.###yes,###i do.###uh, i like *-1 to, uh, play basketball and weight lifting.###those are probably the two main things 0 i like *-1 to do *t*-2.###speakera3.###uh-huh.###um, so those are more or less indoor sports.###how's the weather out there in georgia *t*-1?###speakerb4.###yeah.###speakera5.###speakerb6.
150680:35	i, i think 0 my ankles probably are my main weak point.	probably	###but only thing 0 i'm concerned about *t*-1 is potential for injury to your knees you know,### that and movement of * going up on the step you know,###that could create a problem.###speakera45.###oh.###speakerb46.###speakera47.###uh-huh.###speakerb48.###speakera49.###yeah.###speakerb50.### they, they seem *-1 to think that it, it won't *?*,###but you never know.###speakera51.###now, if, um, playing basketball,###are you knees,###do you have healthy knees?###speakerb52.###yeah,
150806:33	and so um, i get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then, um, * talking with people and just hearing what *t*-1's going on. mumblex.	probably	###while i'm at work sometimes, i, on the computer network um, i read the news sometimes,###speakera7.###uh-huh.###speakerb8.###and that's kind of helpful.###speakera9.###i would imagine 0 * going to college, though, your professors and different things,###you keep up on what *t*-1's going on.###speakerb10.###that's true,###i mean, my roommates and stuff, you know people around me talk about it.###speakera11.###yeah.###speakerb12.###and the people 0 i work with *t*-1 are pretty, you know, up, up-to-date on that kind of stuff,###so.###speakera13.###right.###well, i'm a housewife,###i have three kids,
150857:108	you, you just can't get a full picture of, you know their message unless you have time 0 * to sit down and r-, and probably read something on it *t*-1.	probably	### i think, i think 0 the, uh, i think 0 a lot of the commentators on, like the major networks,###like right, it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on,###but, um, it seems that, um, they kind of get *-1 to throw their opinions into how they, you know, report on the news *t*-2.###speakera29.###right.###and i think 0 even in the elections, they choose who they're going *-2 to follow *t*-1 and who they're not *?* *t*-3,###and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name.###speakerb30.###yeah.###speakera31.###speakerb32.###yeah,###exactly.###speakera33.###i don't think that the way 0 i get the news *t*-2 is the right way 0 * to get it *t*-1.###i think 0 you get a very lopsided picture of what *t*-1's going on.###speakerb34.###uh-huh,###because they can, they can only report on, i mean,###they give each candidate perhaps, you know, ten second blurbs in which * to, you know, to say *t*-1,
150925:79	if they reported every, if they reported every violent crime in atlanta it would take, it would probably take the whole news hour.	probably	###speakera53.###speakerb54.###yeah.###speakera55.###but,###speakerb56.###well, i remember 0 back during the, uh, during the war, everyone here at work always had the radio or the t v on, because that, they were going constantly with that stuff.###speakera57.###right.###speakerb58.###but, uh.###speakera59.###well, i, um, they even did a story *ich*-3 on our news here in texas on what people wanted *-1 to see more of *t*-2,###and people said that they wanted *-1 to see more on outside of texas news.###you know, we just don't want *-2 to hear every night all the killings that *t*-1 went on here in dallas###speakerb60.###yeah.###speakera61.###that we want *-2 to hear what *t*-3's going on with the economy, what *t*-4's being done *-1 * to help it, what *t*-5's going on in other countries, what *t*-6's, you know, just more information.###speakerb62.
150984:15	i guess 0 maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who *t*-1 is very unreasonable in some way, that, uh, you, uh, would have a problem, uh, you know, that you wouldn't convict someone who *t*-2 maybe should be convicted *-4.	maybe	###yeah,### they spent a lot of time, that's another thing, they spend a long time on sports,###and i think that, um, that's fine,###i would like *-1 to see more time spent *-2 on other things.###speakerb78.###yeah.###speakera79.###but.###speakerb80.###it seems like,###i don't know,###they way 0 they do the newscasts *t*-1, i wish 0 they, they kind of separated it, you know,###if you wanted *-1 to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it###but i don't have cable.###speakera1.###i think that, uh, one, uh, advantage of * having, uh, the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want *-1 to make * sure that you don't, uh, convict someone who, uh, *t*-3 really shouldn't be convicted *-2.###speakerb2.###definitely.###speakera3.###um, and i think that, you know, a unanimous verdict, uh, helps *-1 to ensure that.
150984:155	i guess 0 maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who *t*-1 is very unreasonable in some way, that, uh, you, uh, would have a problem, uh, you know, that you wouldn't convict someone who *t*-2 maybe should be convicted *-4.	maybe	###yeah,### they spent a lot of time, that's another thing, they spend a long time on sports,###and i think that, um, that's fine,###i would like *-1 to see more time spent *-2 on other things.###speakerb78.###yeah.###speakera79.###but.###speakerb80.###it seems like,###i don't know,###they way 0 they do the newscasts *t*-1, i wish 0 they, they kind of separated it, you know,###if you wanted *-1 to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it###but i don't have cable.###speakera1.###i think that, uh, one, uh, advantage of * having, uh, the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want *-1 to make * sure that you don't, uh, convict someone who, uh, *t*-3 really shouldn't be convicted *-2.###speakerb2.###definitely.###speakera3.###um, and i think that, you know, a unanimous verdict, uh, helps *-1 to ensure that.
151065:91	uh, one, one thing that i, i think 0 *t*-1 is, um, you know, maybe is a problem is, uh, i, i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now,	maybe	###and it, it didn't even hardly go through,###speakera31.###oh, * didn't really even count.###speakerb32.###so.###speakera33.###yeah.### i'm, i'm a college student###so i haven't been, you know, a jury eligible age for very long###speakerb34.###yeah.###speakera35.###um, and, uh, i did get one summons actually at one point,###but i declined it which i'm able *-1 to do *t*-2 because i'm a student, because it was, uh, a very bad time.###speakerb36.###yeah.###well, you learn a lot *-1 going to the juries like that though.###speakera37.###yeah, i mean, i, i really, i would like *-1 to, uh, to do at some point, um,###but, i, i haven't *?*.
151066:17	but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well.	maybe	###speakera31.###oh, * didn't really even count.###speakerb32.###so.###speakera33.###yeah.### i'm, i'm a college student###so i haven't been, you know, a jury eligible age for very long###speakerb34.###yeah.###speakera35.###um, and, uh, i did get one summons actually at one point,###but i declined it which i'm able *-1 to do *t*-2 because i'm a student, because it was, uh, a very bad time.###speakerb36.###yeah.###well, you learn a lot *-1 going to the juries like that though.###speakera37.###yeah, i mean, i, i really, i would like *-1 to, uh, to do at some point, um,###but, i, i haven't *?*.###uh, one, one thing that i, i think 0 *t*-1 is, um, you know, maybe is a problem is, uh, i, i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now,
151107:82	the one thing 0 i sometimes wonder about *t*-1, um, in civil cases is, uh, whether, especially sort of in, uh, maybe like pro-, product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, um, sort of a very technical decision 0 *t*-2 to be made *-3 sometimes *t*-4	maybe	###oh, so it was just kind of a zoo###and the jurors just sort of,###someone had *-1 to figure out what *t*-2 was going on?###speakerb46.###that's about what it was *t*-1.###speakera47.###um. that's interesting.### did it, did it work out pretty well in the end?###i mean, did a couple of people sort of gradually, sort of assume, uh, sort of a moderator role in the trial###or,###speakerb48.###yeah,### they, well they picked one person,###and then he finally, you know, moderated everything and made it turn out the way 0 it should have *?* *t*-1.###speakera49.###so it work-, it did end up *-1 working out pretty well?###speakerb50.###yeah,###it ended up *-1 working all right.###speakera51.
151208:106	and then, it was always exciting when we got called *-1 *-4 to, to, to go *t*-2, because then we thought 0 we might be able *-3 to do something else besides, uh, * just sit in the jury room.	might	###was it civil or criminal?###speakerb10.###uh, it was, uh uh, it was, uh, well, * let's see, it was municipal court###speakera11.###a grand jury or,###speakerb12.###speakera13.###uh-huh.###speakerb14.###so it was a combination of, uh,###and i was in the pool for a couple of weeks###speakera15.###i see.###speakerb16.###so it was a combination of criminal and civil,###and they had, uh,###well most of the time we, we spent *t*-3 *-1 sitting around in the jury room and getting *-2 to know the other potential jurors###speakera17.###uh-huh.###speakerb18.
151247:14	because you'd probably be, uh, too puritanical	probably	###but it's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like, you know,###speakera25.###no.###speakerb26.###they want *-1 to get the best, uh, mix for their case,###so they ask all kinds of wild questions.###speakera27.### that that's a science in itself.###speakerb28.###speakera29.###speakerb30.###yeah,###well i kept *-1 getting called *-2 up for drunk driving questions,###and i think 0 part of it was 0 they didn't, uh, they didn't like the fact that i don't drink any more.###so.###speakera31.###uh-huh,###i see.###speakerb32.###speakera33.
151251:11	that was probably it,	probably	###they want *-1 to get the best, uh, mix for their case,###so they ask all kinds of wild questions.###speakera27.### that that's a science in itself.###speakerb28.###speakera29.###speakerb30.###yeah,###well i kept *-1 getting called *-2 up for drunk driving questions,###and i think 0 part of it was 0 they didn't, uh, they didn't like the fact that i don't drink any more.###so.###speakera31.###uh-huh,###i see.###speakerb32.###speakera33.###because you'd probably be, uh, too puritanical###and###speakerb34.###yeah,
151255:19	although in my case i might have been more, uh, sympathetic with the person who *t*-1 got caught *-2,	might	###speakerb28.###speakera29.###speakerb30.###yeah,###well i kept *-1 getting called *-2 up for drunk driving questions,###and i think 0 part of it was 0 they didn't, uh, they didn't like the fact that i don't drink any more.###so.###speakera31.###uh-huh,###i see.###speakerb32.###speakera33.###because you'd probably be, uh, too puritanical###and###speakerb34.###yeah,###that was probably it,###speakera35.###mumblex.###speakerb36.
151468:18	all right, it's probably the same thing.	probably	###or do they?###speakerb33.###well, see, this is it,###this is where i start *-1 having my problems with my company *t*-2.###i work for a private company,### and and the policy is something like, * see if i can re-, state this correctly now. if you turn yourself in as *-1 having a drug related problem, then you're eligible for company counseling.###speakera34.###uh-huh.###speakerb35.###speakera36.###uh-huh.###speakerb37.###but if they catch you, if you test positive for a, a controlled substance, then you get fired *-1.###speakera38.###oh, wow.###speakerb39.###so, it, you know, it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos.###speakera40.###huh, that's.###i think 0 our policy is that,
151758:23	it's about two hundred people, maybe.	maybe	### and and it's all of like,### she, she comes from a big family.###speakera18.###uh-huh.###speakerb19.###she has like seven sisters i think 0 *t*-1.###speakera20.###oh, boy.###speakerb21.###they *ich*-1 show up and all their kids.###and then all,###she has, uh,###i have like, uh,###* let's see,###she has four sons and two daughters,###and they *ich*-1 show up and all their kids,###speakera22.###uh-huh.###speakerb23.###so it's a pretty big reunion,
151763:22	um, the, probably the biggest challenge was * getting a place where everyone, you know, could eat comfortably and, and everything *t*-1, uh.	probably	###she has like seven sisters i think 0 *t*-1.###speakera20.###oh, boy.###speakerb21.###they *ich*-1 show up and all their kids.###and then all,###she has, uh,###i have like, uh,###* let's see,###she has four sons and two daughters,###and they *ich*-1 show up and all their kids,###speakera22.###uh-huh.###speakerb23.###so it's a pretty big reunion,###it's about two hundred people, maybe.###speakera24.###oh, my word.###well, what did you find 0 *t*-1 was most helpful in * planning the birthday get together?###speakerb25.
151767:15	i guess 0 probably the most helpful thing was that, um, for the rent, we rented like a, a rescue squad building or something like that.	probably	###they *ich*-1 show up and all their kids.###and then all,###she has, uh,###i have like, uh,###* let's see,###she has four sons and two daughters,###and they *ich*-1 show up and all their kids,###speakera22.###uh-huh.###speakerb23.###so it's a pretty big reunion,###it's about two hundred people, maybe.###speakera24.###oh, my word.###well, what did you find 0 *t*-1 was most helpful in * planning the birthday get together?###speakerb25.###um, the, probably the biggest challenge was * getting a place where everyone, you know, could eat comfortably and, and everything *t*-1, uh.###speakera26.###uh-huh.###speakerb27.
151815:11	she looks probably like she's in her early sixties	probably	###yeah,###yeah,###* show off a little bit.###speakerb41.###yeah.###and of course my grandmother's food was, as always, gone first because she's such a great cook.###speakera42.###oh.###speakerb43.###speakera44.###oh.###now how old is she *t*-1?###speakerb45.###uh, she's eighty-six.###speakera46.###oh, goodness.### is she pretty spry,###is she, you know, pretty.###speakerb47.###now she does,
151916:8	i might as well *?*.	might	###speakerb79.###nobody *ich*-1 moves away except us.###speakera80.###they must really like it there.###speakerb81.###yeah,###i got out as soon as i graduated.###speakera82.###yeah.###oh.###speakerb83.###just like this town is too small for me,###good-bye.###speakera84.###oh, you're ready *-1 to move on to bi-,###speakera1.###okay,###you want *-1 to start?###speakerb2.###yeah,
152278:47	uh, so the, uh, the benefits, uh, probably the main thing 0 i like *t*-1 about the benefits is the, uh, the, uh, very generous vacation time and sick time.	probably	###speakera11.###oh.###speakerb12.###overall i'm satisfied with it.###we don't have the vision care,###we do have the health care and the, uh, and the medi-, or the dental.###speakera13.###uh-huh.###speakerb14.###uh.###speakera15.###are you a professor there?###speakerb16.###no,### i work in, i'm a, on the professional administrative and technical staff,###and i, effectively i run the telephone switch at, uh, at the university of new hampshire.###speakera17.###oh, i see,###okay.###speakerb18.
152298:8	you maybe get two or three a year.	maybe	###uh, so the, uh, the benefits, uh, probably the main thing 0 i like *t*-1 about the benefits is the, uh, the, uh, very generous vacation time and sick time.###speakera19.###oh, no doubt.###speakerb20.###we get fifteen days a year sick time,###and, uh, we get twenty-four days a year, right from the day one when you start work *t*-1, you get twenty-four days a year, uh, time off.###speakera21.###right.###well, that's good.###speakerb22.###yeah.###speakera23.###yeah,###that's one of the things 0 i guess 0 i would change *t*-1 about honeywell, is, uh,###i used *-1 to work with the army research institute,###and * being a, uh, a government organization you got quite a few holidays off.###speakerb24.###right.###speakera25.###but here you don't get that.
152354:23	i think 0 health care is probably the, the most pressing uh, the pressing one,	probably	###they've essentially made up a list of, uh, oh, all the different, uh, medical maladies that you can have *t*-1 and then basically made a cutoff,###speakerb40.###oh, yeah.###speakera41.###about six hundred and eighty-seven and below will not be covered *-1 by, by, uh, subsidized health care,###and the ones above would *?*.###speakerb42.###um.###speakera43.###so it's kind of like * drawing this line### and, and if you have it great,###if you don't, you're kind of out of luck###speakerb44.###uh-huh.###speakera45.###but, um, it was kind of an interesting show.###speakerb46.###um.###speakera47.###i think 0 you're right,
152472:23	and i suppose 0 that's maybe a disadvantage of * being in a larger institution, perhaps somewhat even with the business, uh.	maybe	###so there is a progressive path,###but * not being in the say the commercial sector, the motivation isn't there for a lot of people uh, like really,###speakerb10.###um.###speakera11.###speakerb12.###are they like pretty much train *-1 for a specific job###and that what i hired for *t*-1 and then i, just very little variation from that.###speakera13.###yeah,###somewhat that,###but then also there just isn't the ability * to in one sense have, uh, a broader scope for * rewarding people for their performances.###speakerb14.###uh-huh.###speakera15.###uh, so that's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution *t*-1,###uh, it *exp*-1's a little more difficult * to recognize an individual's performance###speakerb16.###uh-huh.###speakera17.
152498:57	uh, so i, i think 0 there it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in, uh, institutions are slower * to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses, we need *-1 to cut back, that's what we do *t*-2.	probably	###you mean security, job security?###speakera19.###job security,###yes.###speakerb20.###uh, that use *-1 to be *?* i think a couple of years ago,###but i don't know if it is *?* so much anymore.###in fact, they, we just had a lay off in what november, i guess.###speakera21.###uh-huh.###speakerb22.###but, uh, it wasn't necessarily,###i mean, you know, some people had been there a long time.###speakera23.###yeah,###we are seeing that here as well.###like in some of the large oil companies. there has been massive lay offs.###speakerb24.###uh-huh.###speakera25.
152558:12	that's maybe the majority of the importance, i guess 0 *t*-1.	maybe	###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###and then they wonder why it doesn't get done *-1 in the same amount of time *t*-2.###well, those people aren't there anymore.###speakera43.###right.###because it's support people that *t*-1 are providing the speed for it.###speakerb44.###yeah.###speakera45.###speakerb46.###uh-huh.###speakera47.###speakerb48.###yeah,###but,###so what else do you think 0 *t*-1 is important?###speakera49.###well the, uh,
152575:15	i think 0 probably in a small,	probably	###so what else do you think 0 *t*-1 is important?###speakera49.###well the, uh,###that's maybe the majority of the importance, i guess 0 *t*-1.###yeah,###because my perspective is from an institution,###uh, the, there is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe###speakerb50.###uh-huh.###speakera51.###speakerb52.###uh-huh.###speakera53.###but if you're in the corporate world, i think there is considerable motivation for i guess in-, innovation,###although he, you know, * the more complex 0 your structure *?* *t*-2 the, uh, less difficult it *exp*-1 is *t*-3 * to kind of carry some things through###speakerb54.###uh-huh.###speakera55.###but, uh, i think 0 there is, uh, it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's, uh, things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of the efforts.###speakerb56.
152578:8	you probably have a better team, uh, cooperation, or team playing, atmosphere.	probably	###that's maybe the majority of the importance, i guess 0 *t*-1.###yeah,###because my perspective is from an institution,###uh, the, there is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe###speakerb50.###uh-huh.###speakera51.###speakerb52.###uh-huh.###speakera53.###but if you're in the corporate world, i think there is considerable motivation for i guess in-, innovation,###although he, you know, * the more complex 0 your structure *?* *t*-2 the, uh, less difficult it *exp*-1 is *t*-3 * to kind of carry some things through###speakerb54.###uh-huh.###speakera55.###but, uh, i think 0 there is, uh, it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's, uh, things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of the efforts.###speakerb56.###i think 0 probably in a small,###yeah,###i was going *-1 to say 0 more, it's more personal for one thing.
152647:11	that's definitely a problem.	definitely	###uh-huh.###that's a concern of mine.###uh, i would feel more comfortable *ich*-1 in many cases i think 0 *t*-2 with judges. uh, you know, doing the sentencing.###speakera13.###uh-huh.### the other thing, the only thing that *t*-1 really bothers me about that is 0 i think you know, that a judge can be### i, i like the idea of juries of your peers uh, in that you, you, you get more personally more than one person making the, making a decision.###speakerb14.###uh-huh.###speakera15.###and second of all, you get a wide variety of background so that,###speakerb16.###yeah,###my question i guess are they really your peers?###speakera17.###uh-huh.###i'd agree with that.###speakerb18.###uh, uh, too often i think 0 they are not *?*###speakera19.
152676:35	i, guess 0 i, i definitely agree with you,	definitely	###uh, i think that, uh, in such cases, uh, they are not really looking for unbiased people, but rather for biased.###speakera25.###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###uh, now i happen *-1 to know several judges###and there is one that i would feel uncomfortable but has me-, doing sentencing without the jury.###i would feel a little bit uneasy about###speakera27.###speakerb28.###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb30.###but the other two i feel 0 *t*-1, uh, would give either you know, the plaintiff or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law.###speakera31.###uh-huh.###speakerb32.###and i guess 0 that's what i am concerned with *t*-1.###speakera33.###yeah,###yeah.
152919:117	i mean it *exp*-3 doesn't seem right that somebody that *t*-1 makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that *t*-2 makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes.	might	###speakera43.###and that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the i r s###and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with *t*-1.###speakerb44.###yeah.###the could be nice.###speakera45.###yeah.###speakerb46.###huh.###speakera47.### i, i'd like *-1 to see something like that.###i think 0 it would be fairer###and it would put a, you know, a lot of the tax attorneys our of business###and i am sure 0 they will fight it tooth and nail,###but i really think 0 a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all americans.###speakerb48.###right,###yeah.###speakera49.
153037:35	i think, you know 0 the probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers	probably	###they mainly go with like popular topics just not like basic news.###speakerb20.###uh-huh.###speakera21.###speakerb22.###yeah.### also, also i have the observation *ich*-6 of, uh, with the press is that, like any any stories that i had any first hand knowledge of *t*-1 that i see *t*-2 in the press, you know, which *t*-3 only happened like ten times in my life you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that *t*-4 actually had, had more than just a blurb about it. that the press has managed *-5 to just mess up some aspect of the story###speakera23.###huh.###speakerb24.###speakera25.###yeah.###speakerb26.###it's something wrong.###speakera27.###going,### they're, * looks like they're going more *ich*-1 for ratings than for you know actual news.###speakerb28.###uh-huh.###speakera29.
153060:24	also i have found that newspapers probably aren't as bad as television mumblex.	probably	###speakera31.###they typically have a better.###i am from a small town too here in texas### and so that then like local news is really who *t*-1 grew the biggest tomato###speakerb32.###uh-huh.###speakera33.###and,###speakerb34.###yeah,###the farm report.###speakera35.###yeah,###farm report and oil reports.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###that's pretty pretty sad###or who *t*-1 killed who.###speakerb38.###uh-huh.
153425:16	i'd probably, i'd probably say about a five.	probably	###speakera11.###speakerb12.###um.###speakera13.###there is no national,###speakerb14.###but, it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun, especially if you have the money 0 * to pay for it *t*-1.###speakera15.###uh, in most states as long as you aren't a convicted felon. you know or on probation or, uh, you know, other obvious things like that.###speakerb16.###yeah.###speakera17.###uh, and i know, i know that like in a lot of states you could, you could be just like released *-1 from a mental hospital the day before. you know, be, be obviously insane,### and then, you, you know but * have your legal right * to get a gun.###speakerb18.###huh. i didn't know that.###well, that's pretty scary.###so, does, now do they want us to say where we feel *t*-1 about it, like in *-2 rating it one to ten.###speakera19.###uh, yeah,
153425:30	i'd probably, i'd probably say about a five.	probably	###speakera11.###speakerb12.###um.###speakera13.###there is no national,###speakerb14.###but, it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun, especially if you have the money 0 * to pay for it *t*-1.###speakera15.###uh, in most states as long as you aren't a convicted felon. you know or on probation or, uh, you know, other obvious things like that.###speakerb16.###yeah.###speakera17.###uh, and i know, i know that like in a lot of states you could, you could be just like released *-1 from a mental hospital the day before. you know, be, be obviously insane,### and then, you, you know but * have your legal right * to get a gun.###speakerb18.###huh. i didn't know that.###well, that's pretty scary.###so, does, now do they want us to say where we feel *t*-1 about it, like in *-2 rating it one to ten.###speakera19.###uh, yeah,
153427:22	that's where i would probably be *t*-1.	probably	###um.###speakera13.###there is no national,###speakerb14.###but, it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun, especially if you have the money 0 * to pay for it *t*-1.###speakera15.###uh, in most states as long as you aren't a convicted felon. you know or on probation or, uh, you know, other obvious things like that.###speakerb16.###yeah.###speakera17.###uh, and i know, i know that like in a lot of states you could, you could be just like released *-1 from a mental hospital the day before. you know, be, be obviously insane,### and then, you, you know but * have your legal right * to get a gun.###speakerb18.###huh. i didn't know that.###well, that's pretty scary.###so, does, now do they want us to say where we feel *t*-1 about it, like in *-2 rating it one to ten.###speakera19.###uh, yeah,### i'd probably, i'd probably say about a five.###speakerb20.
153454:197	uh, you know, i mean, the problem though, you know, they, if the, since the united states had this, you know, pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that i think, you know, 0 if you were introduced, you know, any controls, it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already.	probably	###speakerb24.###because i mean i do think that some people need them and, like, for protection and stuff###speakera25.###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###and i can understand them wanting *-1 to have them,###but then again it's just like all those nuts out there.###speakera27.###well, you know, uh, uh, no-,###if you are looking at like you know country that, uh, where they do have a lot more gun control *t*-1, like england and places like that, you know the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much.###speakerb28.###it has *?*?###because then,###speakera29.###well i mean yeah.### the, uh, the###in * comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the united states.###speakerb30.###um.###speakera31.
153480:36	if i get one, i think 0 i will probably, you know, get something.	probably	###well, is the crime that bad there in atlanta?###speakera35.###uh, i'm not really sure how bad it is *t*-1.### i've, i've not really had that many problems with it,###but i mean apparently we, we were ranked *-1 pretty high up.###speakerb36.###yeah###i know 0 dallas is *?*.###speakera37.###uh. i mean, i think, you know, in the te-,###i mean i think 0 we have been like ranked *-1 in one of the top three for murders in the last few years.###speakerb38.###i don't know if dallas is in the top three###speakera39.###uh-huh.###speakerb40.###but. do you own a gun?###speakera41.###no.###i've thought about *-1 getting one.

153482:11	i would probably get like a shotgun.	probably	###uh, i'm not really sure how bad it is *t*-1.### i've, i've not really had that many problems with it,###but i mean apparently we, we were ranked *-1 pretty high up.###speakerb36.###yeah###i know 0 dallas is *?*.###speakera37.###uh. i mean, i think, you know, in the te-,###i mean i think 0 we have been like ranked *-1 in one of the top three for murders in the last few years.###speakerb38.###i don't know if dallas is in the top three###speakera39.###uh-huh.###speakerb40.###but. do you own a gun?###speakera41.###no.###i've thought about *-1 getting one.###if i get one, i think 0 i will probably, you know, get something.###i probably wouldn't get a hand gun.
153500:11	they are probably going *-1 to miss the person	probably	###if i get one, i think 0 i will probably, you know, get something.###i probably wouldn't get a hand gun.###i would probably get like a shotgun.###just for * protecting myself. you know, from burglar type thing.###speakerb42.###uh-huh.###speakera43.###i do kind of live in the downtown area.###speakerb44.###yeah.###speakera45.###you know and shotguns are really good because they're,###i mean somebody is not going *-1 to break in, steal it, and you know, use it *-2 to mug someone, you know.###speakerb46.###that's true.###speakera47.###uh, and you know, you,###yeah,###i just don't understand these people, you know, like when they, they decide 0 they're going *-1 to buy a gun 0 *t*-2 to protect themselves *t*-3.###they go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which *t*-1 is going *-2 to shoot through you know,
153596:24	that's, uh, sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what i have *t*-1.	probably	###yeah,###right.### that kind of i mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns *t*-1.###speakera83.###uh-huh.###speakerb84.###i would be scared *-1 selling guns to people.###speakera1.###okay.###so frank, what, uh, type of, uh, budget do you or your family have *t*-1?###speakerb2.###well, uh i don't know that we really have a budget.###i have a set amount that i, that i save *t*-1.### actually, well actually there is a, a way, budget our money apparently.###the,###uh, my wife, uh, has so much, uh, gets so much 0 * to do shopping with *t*-1 every couple of weeks###and, uh, we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff, gas, and things like that###and besides that i, uh, you know, i have a set amount that i save *t*-1 every month.###speakera3.###right.
153661:18	i just have a maybe a targeted amount that i will save for *t*-1.	maybe	###uh-huh.###speakerb18.###i've got a money market account that i do a lot of uh, uh, saving in *t*-1###and i also have got a checking account besides that,###but, what i do *t*-2 on my money market account, my taxes for instance which *t*-1 amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month. i will just take two hundred and twenty out###and i put it in parenthesis.###i take it out of the right line total and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up.###speakera19.###uh-huh.###speakerb20.###every month i add two hundred and twenty dollars to it.###then when the tax bill comes in *t*-1 i've got that much set *-2 aside.###speakera21.###right.###speakerb22.###and i guess 0 that's a way of budgeting.###speakera23.###yeah.###that's,###i guess 0 i kind of do a similar thing. more, uh, medium or longer range.
153663:5	probably within a year i would like *-1 to buy a new car.	probably	###i've got a money market account that i do a lot of uh, uh, saving in *t*-1###and i also have got a checking account besides that,###but, what i do *t*-2 on my money market account, my taxes for instance which *t*-1 amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month. i will just take two hundred and twenty out###and i put it in parenthesis.###i take it out of the right line total and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up.###speakera19.###uh-huh.###speakerb20.###every month i add two hundred and twenty dollars to it.###then when the tax bill comes in *t*-1 i've got that much set *-2 aside.###speakera21.###right.###speakerb22.###and i guess 0 that's a way of budgeting.###speakera23.###yeah.###that's,###i guess 0 i kind of do a similar thing. more, uh, medium or longer range.###i just have a maybe a targeted amount that i will save for *t*-1.###like i am,
153672:16	uh, cars are definitely something that you have *-1 to figure *t*-2 into your budget. not only for * buying them, but for * keeping them on the road too.	definitely	###then when the tax bill comes in *t*-1 i've got that much set *-2 aside.###speakera21.###right.###speakerb22.###and i guess 0 that's a way of budgeting.###speakera23.###yeah.###that's,###i guess 0 i kind of do a similar thing. more, uh, medium or longer range.###i just have a maybe a targeted amount that i will save for *t*-1.###like i am,###probably within a year i would like *-1 to buy a new car.###speakerb24.###uh-huh.###speakera25.###so, i kind of have a, an amount in my mind###and i am making every effort *-2 to, to sal-, put a little bit away and increase the amount that i need *t*-1 for a down payment or whatever.###speakerb26.###uh-huh.###yeah.
153714:42	but if you are rolling it over every three years, it *exp*-1 might be advantageous * to do that.	might	###speakerb34.###speakera35.###right.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###have you thought about, uh, leasing?###speakerb38.###well, uh, i have thought about it,###but leasing wouldn't, you know,###i don't use it for my business.###speakera39.###i see.###speakerb40.###my wife uses hers just for pleasure###and i use mine just *-2 to go back and forth to work which *t*-1 is only ten miles away###speakera41.###right.###speakerb42.###so.###speakera43.
153787:24	* coming from texas you're probably,	probably	###huh?###speakera5.###what's your view *t*-1?###speakerb6.###well, i have a hard time * thinking that they can control guns. personally.###speakera7.###yeah.###speakerb8.###speakera9.###yeah,###that's true.###speakerb10.###i mean,###speakera11.###you know, even if they give it a shot, it's still going *-1 to be black market all over the place, you know,###speakerb12.###that's right.###that's right.###speakera13.###i don't know.
153790:16	but gun control is probably frowned on *-2 quite a bit down there i would think 0 *t*-1.	probably	###speakerb6.###well, i have a hard time * thinking that they can control guns. personally.###speakera7.###yeah.###speakerb8.###speakera9.###yeah,###that's true.###speakerb10.###i mean,###speakera11.###you know, even if they give it a shot, it's still going *-1 to be black market all over the place, you know,###speakerb12.###that's right.###that's right.###speakera13.###i don't know.###* coming from texas you're probably,###i don't know###i shouldn't make stereo types,
153957:49	i guess, i guess 0 some forms of guns should probably be controlled *-1	probably	###they have a waiting period where you buy one *t*-1###and that's a week###speakerb70.###uh-huh.###speakera71.###and then they check you out and make * sure 0 you don't have a record you know and things like that.###i think 0 that's a pretty good idea.###uh, and that's,###i don't know,###that's not a bad idea,###but then again you can always get around that.###you could go through the black market like you say.###you know, you always be able *-1 to get around###but, uh,###speakerb72.###sure.###speakera73.###yeah,###it's one of things###but, uh, i don't know.
153984:18	you know, you might do the same thing.	might	###i'm just not,###i think 0 those have been pretty much, you know, banned *-1 altogether anyway.###speakerb76.###yeah,###i###speakera77.###there,###speakerb78.###fully auto,###but, even well, i mean, a semiautomatic, i guess 0 that's,###speakera79.###it kind of takes the sport out of hunting.###speakerb80.###yeah.###right.###speakera81.###you know, it's like what *ich*-3 can you do *t*-1 with that, that you can't do *t*-2 in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve.###speakerb82.###sure.###speakera83.
154198:8	you probably,	probably	###speakerb44.###i mean he does that.###speakera45.###i haven't really noticed them doing that,###but whatever,###again i don't watch t v news that much now.###if i had access to c n n, i would watch t v news more.###uh, i don't you know, but i don't usually.###speakerb46.###yeah,###i don't have access either. although, i did at one time###and it was,###i did during the gulf war###and it was addictive.###speakera47.###yeah.### did you, did you think that c n n, well, the gulf war coverage would be kind of, uh, an abnormality?###i just wonde-, i guess 0 *t*-1.###i would be curious *-1 to know what you thought *t*-2 as to how like say c n n t v news compared to the three networks *t*-3. uh, you know whether you thought 0 it was more of a biased or whatever###but i, i guess 0 you wouldn't *?*.
154199:36	if you just watched it during the gulf war, that probably wouldn't wouldn't tell you much.	probably	###i mean he does that.###speakera45.###i haven't really noticed them doing that,###but whatever,###again i don't watch t v news that much now.###if i had access to c n n, i would watch t v news more.###uh, i don't you know, but i don't usually.###speakerb46.###yeah,###i don't have access either. although, i did at one time###and it was,###i did during the gulf war###and it was addictive.###speakera47.###yeah.### did you, did you think that c n n, well, the gulf war coverage would be kind of, uh, an abnormality?###i just wonde-, i guess 0 *t*-1.###i would be curious *-1 to know what you thought *t*-2 as to how like say c n n t v news compared to the three networks *t*-3. uh, you know whether you thought 0 it was more of a biased or whatever###but i, i guess 0 you wouldn't *?*.###you probably,
154291:28	we found that, uh, it's definitely helped, uh, * get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses.	definitely	###speakerb26.###yeah.###speakera27.###yeah.###every penny is ear marked *-1###but, uh it, we have found 0 that works the best### and and so if we can just divide them up, all the major bills up.###in fact, we found it *exp*-1 easier * to divide the major bills up, you know, cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half,### but and * divide those up between all,###uh-huh.###speakerb28.###all the checks,###yeah.###speakera29.###and so we are not taking a huge sum out, out of one###and then the next pay check we're real short###or,###speakerb30.###right.###yeah,
154500:51	so you have never heard of like the christian music that i listen to *t*-1 probably.	probably	###no,###i'm more into, uh, older rock, like the psychedelic era, like, uh###speakerb34.###seventies and like that stuff.###speakera35.### se- late sixties, seventies,###uh###speakerb36.###uh-huh.###speakera37.###greatful dead, crosby, stills and nash.###speakerb38.###yeah,###i have friends that *t*-1 like that.###speakera39.###what?###speakerb40.###yeah.###speakera41.###speakerb42.
154905:17	i only do it probably two or three times a week.	probably	###speakera13.###yes.###speakerb14.###it's, uh, you know, a national company###and we have a jazzercise center *ich*-2 here in plano that *t*-1 has classes like all day long###so you can,###speakera15.###are they different from aerobics###or is it the same thing?###speakerb16.###no### it's really, it's an aerobic routine.### yo-, you warm up###and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity *-1 starting, you know, slowly and then working up to, uh, you know, a high heart rate###and then you gradually go down again.###speakera17.###and you do that every day###or,###speakerb18.###no,
154931:10	or they might play tennis	might	###and this is a club###or, uh, do you belong to a group?###speakerb22.###well, it's really a###i mean it's called *-1 a center###and you buy as many classes as you want *-1 to *?* at a time###and then you just go in whenever you can *?* *t*-1.###so, like i usually choose *-1 to go at nine thirty in the morning###or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings.###speakera23.###do you go with friends###or do you go alone?###speakerb24.###no,###i go by myself###and that's one of the frustrating things cause i can find very few people 0 *t*-1 to go with me###speakera25.###yeah.###speakerb26.###and most of my friends that *t*-1 are my age don't exercise
155020:13	well, it might not *?*.	might	###i mean, people are always saying to me, how do you stay thin *t*-1###and it's because i exercise###speakera53.###you do it,###speakerb54.###but i also watch what i eat *t*-1. you know,###speakera55.###uh-huh.###speakerb56.###but you'll come,###*-1 being twenty-seven, you don't really have *-1 to worry about your heart rate and that yet###speakera57.###yeah###and i###speakerb58.###but as you get older you will *?*.###speakera59.###well everyone's told me 0 my waist line is going *-1 to expand one of these days,###but i don't know.###speakerb60.
155106:10	well, maybe it isn't in utah.	maybe	###but,###speakerb84.###but there's a fun-, there is a place in utah called * a funny name.###speakera85.###there's snow bird or alta.###speakerb86.###but it's like, oh, heavenly.###is that it?###speakera87.###heavenly?###speakerb88.###yeah,###i think 0 it's called *-1 heavenly.###speakera89.###huh. i've never heard of that one.###speakerb90.###you've never heard of that?###speakera91.###huh-uh.###speakerb92.
155220:46	but, uh, we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people *t*-1.	might	###actually, the government has placed the deposit which *t*-1 is the inducement * to re-, recycle the bottle so that you get your money back###and then the recycler run * by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit### and then i, and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that *t*-1 do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well.###speakerb16.###that's very cool.###you know there's a, i heard about a similar program in new york city where, uh, a thing called * like homeless incorporated or something like that,###but what they do *t*-1 is * employ, uh, homeless, i think mostly men, but homeless people to uh, go out and collect all the recyclable cans### and and i think 0 it's mostly cans.###there may be bottles as well,###but like beer cans, soda cans and what not###and they, uh, bring them up to a one lo-, one centralized location and, uh, are able *-2 to collect the money from the various beer and, and soda manufacturers and, uh, and get more money to these people that *t*-1 desperately need it.###speakera17.###oh yeah.###uh, i guess partly because of our climate.###here in saskatoon at least, the majority of central, uh,###well, i want *-1 to say central canada,###but central canada tends *-1 to referred more to ontario and quebec###speakerb18.###yeah.###speakera19.
155221:8	we certainly have a fair number of people that *t*-1 are on welfa-, welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing.	certainly	###and then the recycler run * by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit### and then i, and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that *t*-1 do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well.###speakerb16.###that's very cool.###you know there's a, i heard about a similar program in new york city where, uh, a thing called * like homeless incorporated or something like that,###but what they do *t*-1 is * employ, uh, homeless, i think mostly men, but homeless people to uh, go out and collect all the recyclable cans### and and i think 0 it's mostly cans.###there may be bottles as well,###but like beer cans, soda cans and what not###and they, uh, bring them up to a one lo-, one centralized location and, uh, are able *-2 to collect the money from the various beer and, and soda manufacturers and, uh, and get more money to these people that *t*-1 desperately need it.###speakera17.###oh yeah.###uh, i guess partly because of our climate.###here in saskatoon at least, the majority of central, uh,###well, i want *-1 to say central canada,###but central canada tends *-1 to referred more to ontario and quebec###speakerb18.###yeah.###speakera19.###but, uh, we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people *t*-1.
155300:24	* find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way 0 we will be able *-1 to, uh, do it *t*-2.	probably	###and we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point###but, uh, we're to the point *ich*-1 now where our financial income is enough that we can consider *-2 putting some away for college *t*-3,###speakera15.###uh-huh.###speakerb16.###so we are going *-1 to be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall###speakera17.###um.###speakerb18.###and then the money that i will be making *t*-1 this summer we'll be putting *t*-2 away for the college fund.###speakera19.###um. * sounds good.###yeah,###i guess 0 we're, we're just at the point,###uh, my wife worked until we had a family###and then, you know, now we're just going on the one income###so it *exp*-1's a lot more interesting * trying *-2 to, uh,###speakerb20.###uh-huh.###speakera21.
155358:13	uh, * probably need *-2 to try *-1 to get back on the topic	probably	###oh, okay.###yeah,###that is how i got it *t*-1 as well###but, uh,###speakerb38.###and he just forwarded that on to me###and, uh, it sounded like it would be an interesting project 0 * to participate in *t*-1###speakera39.###uh-huh.###speakerb40.###so i sent back mumblex mail.###speakera41.###yeah,### it *exp*-2 will be interesting * to see what, it *exp*-1 would be interesting * to see how the data base,###speakerb42.###speakera43.###mumblex so, well, i guess 0 we're talking about the experiment.###speakerb44.###uh-huh.###speakera45.
155760:8	oh definitely it's,	definitely	###uh-huh.###speakerb75.###speakera76.###no,###she loves it.###she has a great social life###and she travels###and, uh, it's in, in the very in the mountains###and it's beautiful###and, uh, i, i hope that i have something like that when i get older *t*-1.###speakerb77.###yeah### i, i think, i think 0 the, uh i think that the decision that *t*-1 needs *-3 to be made *-4 though on nursing home has *-5 to be a joint one between the, uh, elderly uh, person who *t*-2's going in and the family that *t*-6's going *-7 to be, uh, effec-, effected *-8 by it###speakera78.###uh-huh.###speakerb79.###speakera80.###uh-huh.###speakerb81.###speakera82.
155897:36	like they send me to conferences for instance, but probably not as much as i'd like *?*	probably	###speakera39.###but in, in the same token, it's a very, really enjoyable for me because i don't have *-1 to have, you know, nobody breathing down my back### and and one of the things that i, i really hate *t*-3 about jobs. i don't, i don't like bosses that, that you know *t*-1 want *-2 to yell at you and you know are down on your back and all this and that.###speakerb40.###uh-huh.###speakera41.### i, i just really can't deal with that###so,###speakerb42.###yeah.###speakera43.### what kind of, what kind of jobs have you done *t*-1?###speakerb44.###well, well, i do wo-, uh, research in computer science###and i've just been doing that for a few years now###so uh, i, my job has most of the benefits 0 i want *t*-1.###speakera45.###uh-huh.###speakerb46.###uh, what i really like *t*-1 is, i like *-2 being,
155907:19	you have what you might call *t*-1 knowledge power	might	###speakera43.### what kind of, what kind of jobs have you done *t*-1?###speakerb44.###well, well, i do wo-, uh, research in computer science###and i've just been doing that for a few years now###so uh, i, my job has most of the benefits 0 i want *t*-1.###speakera45.###uh-huh.###speakerb46.###uh, what i really like *t*-1 is, i like *-2 being,###like they send me to conferences for instance, but probably not as much as i'd like *?*###but, uh, you know, that's just nice being, you know, having a company being able *-2 to give you time 0 * to do that sort of thing and sort of,###uh, they also,###a really important thing to me is when they, uh, they pay for continuing education *t*-1.###like, i, i get night courses that they they'll cover *t*-1 right now###and that's really good###yeah.###speakera47.###yeah,###that's just great.
155997:7	but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in *-2 trying *-1 to catch up.	maybe	###uh-huh.###speakerb22.###speakera23.###uh, the only prob-, the only problem 0 i see *t*-1 with term limitations, uh, is that i think that the bureaucracy in our government as * is *?* in, with most governments is just so complex that there's a very lar-, you know, there, there is a learning curve and that, you know, you d-, can't just send someone off to washington and expect, you know, his first day to be an effective, uh, congress person.###uh, i think, i think 0 there really is a, there's a lot 0 they need *-1 to learn *t*-3, you know, when you get there *t*-2.###speakerb24.### i think, i think 0 that's true,###however, i think 0 that's always been true.###speakera25.###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###i mean, that's true of the presidency, too,###and we seem *-1 to be able *-2 to get along with the president turnover ever eight years or four years.###and, uh,###speakera27.###yeah###but,###speakerb28.###they,###i mean, there is a lot 0 * to learn *t*-1,
156005:12	uh, but maybe * standardizing on, on a, a four year term for congress senate and the, the presidency and then, uh, staggering them so that you don't,	maybe	###speakera25.###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###i mean, that's true of the presidency, too,###and we seem *-1 to be able *-2 to get along with the president turnover ever eight years or four years.###and, uh,###speakera27.###yeah###but,###speakerb28.###they,###i mean, there is a lot 0 * to learn *t*-1,###but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in *-2 trying *-1 to catch up.###i think 0 two years is too short.###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb30.###i think 0 it would have *-1 to be extended *-2, uh, you know,###a term limitation for congress would be like three terms or even four terms###or you would increase the length of the, of each term of a congressman.
156042:20	you know, it might only be two hour drive from here,	might	###uh-huh.###speakerb36.###uh, the c i a is moving out to west virginia which *t*-1 is a really stupid location for a large agency like that and for almost any agency.###i mean, the action isn't in west virginia.###i hate *-1 to tell the s-, the senator from west virginia this information,###but it really doesn't e-, ar-,###speakera37.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###speakerb38.###the world does not revolve around west virginia uh, as far as this country is concerned *-1,###speakera39.###speakerb40.###the world does revolve around d c, you know as far as the politics in this country *ich*-2 are concerned *-1, the national politics###speakera41.###uh-huh.###speakerb42.###and the c i a is a, a very large, very high profile agency###and * to have it located *-1 out in west virginia,###yeah,
156118:31	but i've always considered automobiles to be, probably the, the prime contributor.	probably	###yeah.###speakerb8.###speakera9.###yeah.###speakerb10.###speakera11.###right.###speakerb12.###actually very,###speakera13.###speakerb14.### y-, you know, you go even a few wi-, miles out###and you got, uh, farms and everything###so you, relatively clear air.###speakera15.###right.###speakerb16.###but, uh,###speakera17.###well, i don't know about you,
156120:23	but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that.	probably	###speakera9.###yeah.###speakerb10.###speakera11.###right.###speakerb12.###actually very,###speakera13.###speakerb14.### y-, you know, you go even a few wi-, miles out###and you got, uh, farms and everything###so you, relatively clear air.###speakera15.###right.###speakerb16.###but, uh,###speakera17.###well, i don't know about you,###but i've always considered automobiles to be, probably the, the prime contributor.###i mean there's a lot of contributors,
156122:22	oh, d-, definitely.	definitely	###speakerb10.###speakera11.###right.###speakerb12.###actually very,###speakera13.###speakerb14.### y-, you know, you go even a few wi-, miles out###and you got, uh, farms and everything###so you, relatively clear air.###speakera15.###right.###speakerb16.###but, uh,###speakera17.###well, i don't know about you,###but i've always considered automobiles to be, probably the, the prime contributor.###i mean there's a lot of contributors,###but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that.###speakerb18.
156169:48	i think 0 that's a, that's a contributor definitely.	definitely	###they're actually coming out with the first prototypes in california.###speakerb28.###yeah,###that,###and i think also 0 some of the, uh, car companies are coming out with, uh, gas powered fleets so you,###speakera29.###yeah.###speakerb30.###natural gas powered rather than, uh, gasoline.###speakera31.###right.### i hope, i, i'm hoping 0 that comes along quick.###uh, i was reading a, an article in time *ich*-1 the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that's going *t*-2###and i guess 0 it's, it's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize###and i know 0 that's not due to, uh, it's not due to, to gasoline or to, you know, carbon monoxide so much as the c f c --s###but,###speakerb32.### it, it is coming from cars, though.###speakera33.###uh, yeah,
156250:11	denver's definitely	definitely	###speakerb58.###speakera59.###yeah,###you don't get that, that source of cleansing anymore.### are, have you been in big cities a long time?###speakerb60.### mostly, i've mostly been in the east coast,###so that's going between atlanta, washing-, d c area,###speakera61.###okay,###so you've got,###speakerb62.###a-,###speakera63.###yeah,###those are actually areas that *t*-1 are hit *-2 pretty hard, i would think 0 *t*-3.###speakerb64.###well, not, not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the, uh, major pollution sources as you do out in denver *ich*-2 with the inversion and los angeles and a-, rest of california which *t*-1 is just terrible it sounds.###speakera65.###yeah,
156270:40	i mean, it, it definitely it's not at a level comparable to los angeles or denver	definitely	###denver's definitely###speakerb66.###speakera67.###yeah,###that's one of the worst.###speakerb68.###speakera69.###sure.###yeah,###denver's that, that real good e-, that real good, uh, example of * sitting in a valley, kind of like mexico city does, i guess 0 *t*-1.###speakerb70.###uh-huh.###speakera71.###mexico city is historically been one of the worst in the, in the world for that.###speakerb72.###yeah.###speakera73.###but i've been pretty lucky,###i've lived in cities that *t*-1 really haven't had that much of a problem, although, uh, i'm really kind of based *-2 in orlando, florida###and there, you can tell that it's getting worse.
156300:16	well, i would probably be a junkie or s-, watch c n n a lot,	probably	###and there's not that much in terms of, of public transportation down there.###speakerb78.###uh-huh.###speakera79.###there is *?*,###but it's kind of it's,###speakera1.###jimmy, so how do you get most of your news *t*-1?###speakerb2.###well, i kind of, uh, i watch the, uh, national news every day, for one.###i also read one or two papers a day###and i'm a, i'm pretty much a news junkie###and i tune in to c n n a lot.###speakera3.###oh, wow.###so, when you say the morning news, or evening news or national news *t*-1 is when?###speakerb4.###uh, every evening at six thirty, i believe, i watch the national news.###speakera5.###oh, okay.
156350:88	but, uh, and when you read a lot of this stuff *t*-1, the, the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so,	definitely	###speakerb16.###speakera17.### what, what, uh, newspapers do you read *t*-1?###speakerb18.###well, i read, uh, the local newspaper###and i also try and read one of the, uh, major dailies like the chicago tribune, or the new york times or something like that.###speakera19.###uh-huh.###for a while there i, i, i, uh, subscribed to new york times, a-, actually a couple of newspapers because, uh, you know, my fiance,###well, she was unemployed for a while###so she, you know, really needed *-2 to look at the, the want-, help wanted *-1 ads###speakerb20.###uh-huh.###speakera21.###and so often they, they tr-, the newspapers are trying *-1 to compete with a lot of other sources of newspape-, uh, news.###speakerb22.###right.###speakera23.###and, i don't know,###new york times is okay,
156393:34	uh, i guess 0 a year ago you're probably watching c n n a lot,	probably	###because i,###speakerb34.###right,###yeah,###i miss n p r a lot also.###i really like them because they give, uh,###instead of *-3 being, as your newspaper or your t v news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb *t*-2, they go really in depth on topics which i think 0 *t*-1 is good.###speakera35.###uh,###speakerb36.###and they also,###their editorial stand point seems *-1 to be a lot better than, say, your major network news and that kind of thing.###speakera37.###well, mcneil, neil-, and lehrer,###i guess 0 he's leaving,###one of them is leaving.###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###speakera39.###uh, they're, they're pretty good, too.
156698:11	that's probably true * considering,	probably	###speakera3.###yes.###speakerb4.###and it's eating us *-1 alive budget wise###and, uh,###speakera5.###so are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state?###speakerb6.###yes,###we do practice capital punishment,###speakera7.###speakerb8.###but the nature of the, uh, courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed *-1.###speakera9.###yes,###that's similar to georgia.###speakerb10.###yeah.###and then, i was reading in the paper just this morning, it's interesting because i had forgotten, i guess 0 *t*-1, that i wrote this little topic down, that it *exp*-3 costs more *ich*-2 * to execute somebody th-, than it *exp*-4 does * to keep them. because of all the costs of the appeals and all that you know.###speakera11.
156720:8	quicker maybe,	maybe	###speakera13.###yes.###speakerb14.###speakera15.###yes,###uh, i guess in a way that, it, it kind of defeats the purpose of * having capital punishment if,###speakerb16.###well, i think 0 capital punishment is supposed *-1 to be primarily a deterrent to other people. you know, who *t*-2 would see it.###speakera17.###yes.###speakerb18.###speakera19.###right,###that would be the intent of it.###speakerb20.###yeah,###but i'm not sure how successful that is *t*-1.###speakera21.###well, i think 0 it would be more successful if it was applied *-1 in a more expedient manner, if there weren't so many appeals.###speakerb22.
156726:97	if, if the person who *t*-1's going *-2 to commit the crime knew that they were going *-3 to be punished *-4 severely, possibly capital punishment,	possibly	###speakerb16.###well, i think 0 capital punishment is supposed *-1 to be primarily a deterrent to other people. you know, who *t*-2 would see it.###speakera17.###yes.###speakerb18.###speakera19.###right,###that would be the intent of it.###speakerb20.###yeah,###but i'm not sure how successful that is *t*-1.###speakera21.###well, i think 0 it would be more successful if it was applied *-1 in a more expedient manner, if there weren't so many appeals.###speakerb22.###quicker maybe,###speakera23.###speakerb24.###yeah.###speakera25.###yeah,
156756:16	um, that's probably true,	probably	###um, well, see, i'm a school principal.###speakera31.###um.###speakerb32.###elementary school.###speakera33.###yes.###speakerb34.###and in a very poor section of town with p-, predominantly anglo kids.###and i see kids *ich*-3 already that *t*-1 are going *-2 to be criminals in spite of everything 0 we can do *t*-4###speakera35.###um.###speakerb36.###and, see, i'm afraid 0 i think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people, that,###i mean, course, you couldn't do that because you got *-2 to do something with the ones that *t*-1 are already there###speakera37.###uh-huh.###speakerb38.###but i think 0 we would make a bigger investment in kids, we'd have fewer decisions 0 * to make *t*-1. down the road, you know.###speakera39.
156812:16	well, that's probably true.	probably	###now, not all of them will commit offenses that *t*-1 have *-2 to do with capital punishment,###but some of them have already been in youth centers. and that kind of thing,###speakera55.###um.###speakerb56.###and if we had something 0 * to do *t*-1 before they get *-2 to be full-blown adult criminals,###and i'm not talking about necessarily in the school system,###i'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action.###speakera57.###uh-huh.###speakerb58.###i think 0 that's one reason 0 we have problems in schools, uh,###and some of them are our problems,###but a lot of it's because everything 0 society wants *t*-1, we are supposed *-2 to do *t*-3.###speakera59.###uh-huh.###speakerb60.###but that's another subject###but,###speakera61.
156841:5	certainly capital punishment isn't going *-1 to solve a lot of problems	certainly	###uh-huh.###speakera65.###speakerb66.### i don't, i don't know that there is an easy solution,###but if you could find a way 0 * to prevent some of it *t*-4, and i'm not sure what it would be *t*-1. it would be money better *ich*-2 spent * than,###speakera67.###uh-huh.###speakerb68.###do you know 0 it *exp*-2 costs more *ich*-1 * to keep an inmate on death row than it *exp*-3 does * to send a kid to harvard?###speakera69.###speakerb70.###that's true.###speakera71.###i'm sure 0 it is *?*,###yeah.###speakerb72.###statistically, that's true.###speakera73.###um, yeah,### i don't, i don't,
156864:49	uh, premeditated murder. crimes of that nature, i think 0 *t*-1 should definitely,	definitely	###speakera75.###but,###speakerb76.###are you for it?###speakera77.###uh,###speakerb78.###i'm for it in in some cases.###speakera79.###i guess 0 i am *?* for certain cri-,###speakerb80.###speakera81.###speakerb82.###yeah.###speakera83.###yeah,###in certain crimes.###speakerb84.###what kind of crimes would you d-, use it for *t*-1?###speakera85.
156891:34	i think 0 we need, we definitely need more of it, definitely.	definitely	###speakera89.###um.###speakerb90.###speakera91.###uh-huh.###well, you always have castration.###speakerb92.###well, you know, somebody elected that recently.###speakera93.###yes,###i read about that.###speakerb94.###and all the civil rights people are up in arms about it, you know.###speakera95.###uh-huh.###speakerb96.###but, uh,###speakera1.###so, julie, how do you feel *t*-1 about aids research?###speakerb2.
156891:55	i think 0 we need, we definitely need more of it, definitely.	definitely	###speakera89.###um.###speakerb90.###speakera91.###uh-huh.###well, you always have castration.###speakerb92.###well, you know, somebody elected that recently.###speakera93.###yes,###i read about that.###speakerb94.###and all the civil rights people are up in arms about it, you know.###speakera95.###uh-huh.###speakerb96.###but, uh,###speakera1.###so, julie, how do you feel *t*-1 about aids research?###speakerb2.
156922:66	i mean, still, you know, since it's dormant for such a long time, there's still probably a lot of people, you know, before the tests ever really came out who *t*-1 are, who *t*-2 are draining a lot of money right now. you know,	probably	###speakerb6.###exactly.###speakera7.###uh-huh.###speakerb8.###exactly.### does, does like, d-, do health insurance policies, like, for companies and things,###do they cover diseases like that?###speakera9.###i think 0 they cover aids,###but what they do *t*-1 is, uh, if, you know, you apply for, for *-2 to get a, a insurance policy they'll, uh, check *-3 to see if you're h i v positive###speakerb10.###uh-huh.###speakera11.###and if you are *?*, not only will they not give you, uh, a policy,###but they'll, uh, they have like,###there's like, you know, a database of people that *t*-1 have tested *-2 positive,###so you'll never be able *-1 to get insurance ever again.###speakerb12.###um, well, that's, but that's why they should have s-, started *-1 doing stuff before *t*-2.
157007:11	i would probably agree with that.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakerb44.###speakera45.###i mean, it seems that, you know, it's just, you know, of, it's just going *-1 to reach a steady, a steady state a let, a lot, lot higher point than it will *?* if we, you know, we'd nip it in the bud * to q-, quote barney fife.###speakerb46.###right.###yeah.###i don't know,###i don't know,### i, i, i don't know what the likelihood of that is *t*-1,###but, i mean, you know, people really waking up.###speakera47.###uh-huh.###speakerb48.###especially with the ultra conservatives move 0 our, our political system s-, sort of seems *-1 to be taking *t*-2.###speakera49.###uh-huh.###speakerb50.###speakera51.###uh-huh.
157057:27	uh, and, you know, it certainly doesn't seem *-1 to be a deterrent. uh, for one thing because it's used *-4 so infrequently and for another thing because i honestly don't think 0 the people that *t*-2 are committing the c-, crimes that *t*-3 would be eligible, you know, really care.	certainly	###speakera65.###uh-huh.###speakerb66.###i don't know.###i don't know, fish.###what do you think *t*-1 about that subject?###speakera67.### i think 0 it's, i think 0 it stands a really interesting question of, uh,###speakera1.###so, uh, you know, my feeling is that, uh, it's really being used *-1 today,### it, it, you know, it, it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time 0 the people end up *-1 waiting on appeal *t*-2.###speakerb2.###right,###i think 0 i've seen some statistics that *t*-1 say that, uh, it *exp*-2's more expensive *ich*-3 * to kill somebody than * to keep them in prison for life.###speakera3.###right###because y-, you, you've got all, all the prison expenses, plus all the legal expenses.###speakerb4.###right.###speakera5.
157088:89	but, but the other side to that is, 0 if you put him in prison for life, there's a chance that he might do things in prison, or, you know, and somehow redeem himself.	might	###you know, i, i, i'm never going * to get caught *-1.###speakerb8.###yeah,### b-,###speakera9.###speakerb10.###yeah,###but you also have *-1 to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis,###for example, someone like, uh, jeffrey dahlmer,###do you want,###by * putting him in prison for life, there is still a possibility that he will get out again.###speakera11.###yeah,### one, one way or another.###speakerb12.###whereas if you kill him, there is not that possibility.###speakera13.###speakerb14.###speakera15.###yeah,
157098:96	there are cases where, you know, twenty, thirty years after the fact of * getting evidence, especially as new technology *ich*-2 comes along that *t*-1 might prove their innocence, then, oops, i'm sorry *t*-3,	might	###by * putting him in prison for life, there is still a possibility that he will get out again.###speakera11.###yeah,### one, one way or another.###speakerb12.###whereas if you kill him, there is not that possibility.###speakera13.###speakerb14.###speakera15.###yeah,### but, but the other side to that is, 0 if you put him in prison for life, there's a chance that he might do things in prison, or, you know, and somehow redeem himself.###speakerb16.###yeah,###i don't think 0 he could ever redeem himself,###but in some cases, yes.###speakera17.###well, you know, so that, you know,###speakerb18.###speakera19.### the, the question is, you know, the other qu-, problem with capital punishment 0 you run into *t*-1 is, what are you going *-2 to do *t*-5 about people who *t*-3 are later *-6 to have been found *-4 innocent, you know?
157136:63	w-, w-, we're going *-1 to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something.	probably	###yeah,###and, you know, the, i, i think that, you know,###and the way 0 it's being used *-2 now *t*-1, it's like you listen to bush is, you know,###well, where are we going *-2 to impose d-, you know,###it's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in,###tsongas is also saying, you know, capital, * make it *exp*-1 a capital crime * to be a major drug dealer.###speakerb24.###right.###speakera25.###and, again, i don't thing 0 these people care.###they risk their lives every day.###speakerb26.###yeah,###and, there, there, they seem that the profit marg-, uh, drug dealers, the profit margin's so high that, yeah the, the risk is almost not there.###speakera27.###yeah.###speakerb28.###speakera29.###yeah,### and, and, you know, uh, especially, now, i live in, in massachusetts, you know,
157161:63	you know, a, a, a sixty-two year old guy is less likely * to be put *-1 on death row from what i've seen *t*-2.	likely	###but you look at our, our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to, to like texas or someplace that *t*-1 does, you know, it, it, it *exp*-2's impossible * to make a case that it's, it's affecting it in any way.###speakerb32.###yeah.###speakera33.###i think 0 it's mainly, 0 people, like, they get the vengeance of it.###speakerb34.###yeah,###well it's also,###speakera35.###because, you know,###speakerb36.###i used *-1 to live in georgia###and, you know, the, the big thing down there was, all right, we have capital punishment,###but if you look at who *t*-1 gets accused *-2 and who *t*-3 are the ones who *t*-4 actually get executed *-5, it's very racially related and ethnically related,###speakera37.###oh, yeah###speakerb38.###speakera39.###it's mainl-, lot of blacks.###also a lot of young people.
157168:65	, i mean, obviously, if someone of mine who *t*-1 has close died, i'd probably feel differently,	probably	###well it's also,###speakera35.###because, you know,###speakerb36.###i used *-1 to live in georgia###and, you know, the, the big thing down there was, all right, we have capital punishment,###but if you look at who *t*-1 gets accused *-2 and who *t*-3 are the ones who *t*-4 actually get executed *-5, it's very racially related and ethnically related,###speakera37.###oh, yeah###speakerb38.###speakera39.###it's mainl-, lot of blacks.###also a lot of young people.###you know, a, a, a sixty-two year old guy is less likely * to be put *-1 on death row from what i've seen *t*-2.###speakerb40.###right.###speakera41.###and, you know, i, i think 0 when you listen to like the, uh, the, the victims' families and things *t*-2, they're always talking about, you know, uh, *-1 feeling justified or feeling, you know, like they've gotten something out of it,###i mean, my thought has been, 0 once the guy has been imprisoned *-1, if he goes to jail forever or whatever, if he gets killed *-2, it shouldn't make any difference to the, uh, the victim's family.###the only thing that *t*-1 should really
157320:140	uh, i think 0 i'd like *-1 to get, uh, b m w or if i go the german route, which i'm kind of leaning towards *t*-2 right now, but, uh, or maybe a, hon-, i mean, a, a acura legend.	maybe	###speakera27.###speakerb28.###speakera29.###speakerb30.###okay.###speakera31.###tight turns, hard acceleration.###i've seen a lot of mustangs, uh, compete###and it's interesting.###they get dominated *-1 by the corvettes that *t*-2 are also in their class.###speakerb32.###oh, really?###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###yeah,###i would guess so.###speakera35.###uh, what are you thinking about *-2 buying *t*-1?###speakerb36.
157328:25	a lexus, uh, s c three hundred maybe. something on that order.	maybe	###and it's interesting.###they get dominated *-1 by the corvettes that *t*-2 are also in their class.###speakerb32.###oh, really?###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###yeah,###i would guess so.###speakera35.###uh, what are you thinking about *-2 buying *t*-1?###speakerb36.###uh, i think 0 i'd like *-1 to get, uh, b m w or if i go the german route, which i'm kind of leaning towards *t*-2 right now, but, uh, or maybe a, hon-, i mean, a, a acura legend.###uh###speakera37.###the legend.###speakerb38.###speakera39.###uh.###speakerb40.
157443:58	uh, i think, well, 0 something on the order of a three series, it's probably different.	probably	###* lasts a long time.###that's mainly what i'm looking for *t*-1.###speakera79.###yeah,###that's good.### i also, i was impressed *-1 by, uh, by the mercedes, too.###speakerb80.###oh, yeah.###speakera81.### i really, i really like the mercedes.###speakerb82.### but, but if, if you have a problem with a mercedes, you take it into a shop,### they're going *-1 to, they're going *-2 to hit you up for just all kinds of things.###speakera83.###the factory was nice###and,###speakerb84.###speakera85.###and is it different for the, for the b m w?###speakerb86.
157571:10	but you probably pay more *ich*-1 percentage wise in other taxes.	probably	###speakera33.###uh-huh.###speakerb34.###speakera35.###well isn't,###speakerb36.###but, you know, there's f-, there's a lot of taxes 0 you pay *t*-1 that you're not even aware of *t*-2 that you're paying *t*-3, uh, like when you buy a tire *t*-1, you pay a federal excise tax.###speakera37.###uh-huh,###there's a lot, yeah, lot of hidden taxes.###speakerb38.###you pay gasoline taxes every time 0 you pump something into your, your tank *t*-1.###speakera39.###uh-huh.###speakerb40.###speakera41.###the taxes that people don't think about *t*-1 that,###yeah,### the, the, the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes 0 you pay *t*-1, i guess 0 *t*-2.###speakerb42.
157857:30	i'll, i'll probably have about, two, two and a half years left *.	probably	###well, good,###good.###speakerb54.###and financial aid and scholarships.###speakera55.###uh-huh.###speakerb56.###i'm a music major,###so i have auditions coming * up.###speakera57.###yes,###well, what year are you in *t*-1 in college?###speakerb58.###i'm a sophomore.###speakera59.###you're a sophomore,###so you have a few more years.###speakerb60.###right,###right,
157977:21	i wonder if i could possibly take it on call waiting.	possibly	###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###anyway.###you don't have children?###speakera11.###no.###speakerb12.###but you're married?###speakera13.###yeah,### we, we've been married for two and a half years.###we've been trying for about two years###but no luck yet.###speakerb14.###oh.###speakera15.###hopefully,###speakerb16.###you know, i know 0 we're not supposed *-1 to do this long distance###but actually i'm getting a call.
158276:47	like * say 0 some young kids or something like that that *t*-1 might be inclined more towards a life of crime, had *-2 to sit and watch and, and see a guy burn or, or, you know, something or shot *-3 by a firing squad or something like that.	might	###and i really don't, uh, agree with that.###i don't think 0 anyone who *t*-1 would commit a, uh, a crime that *t*-2 would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, i was about *-3 to kill and dismember this person###but, oh, if they catch me they're going *-1 to kill me###so i better not do it.### i, i just, don't think that, uh, that it works that way.###speakera19.###yeah.###speakerb20.###speakera21.###i don't think 0 it's done *-1.###i don't think 0 we run it as a deterrent.###i mean people say that,###but, i mean, if it was really a deterrent, i mean i think like 0 horse thieves in the old west, you know, they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while.###speakerb22.###uh-huh.###speakera23.###and if we really w-, if it was really seriously going *-1 to be a d-, deterrent, i would think that it would be public.###i mean i don't think 0 it would be this private thing because nobody ever, nobody ever sees it.###if someone ever,###if, you know,
158586:51	i, i, i think 0 that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and p h d's and all that kind of thing and, you know, know all the technical stuff,	probably	###their system,###speakerb48.###speakera49.###right.### but their, but their system was, was great###but, um, the, you know, the caring just wasn't there.###speakerb50.###uh-huh.###speakera51.###the one woman that *t*-2 taught that *t*-1 did the babies. i worked with her###and she was fabulous.###speakerb52.###uh-huh.###speakera53.###she loved them babies,###and she loved them and cared for them.###but, um, every one of the others that i saw *t*-1 was just screaming and yelling and, um, you know, would make me a nervous wreck,###so, you know.###speakerb54.###yeah.
158639:8	you probably heard where, you know, where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back *-1 to control yourself *t*-2.	probably	###an-,###speakera69.###yeah,###you don't see that much.###speakerb70.###yeah,###so they had a really nice balance.###we liked that one.###in fact, it was called *-1 humpty dumpty play school or something,###speakera71.###that's cute.###speakerb72.###but they also did, they also did some of the teaching things###and then they had, um, you know,### obedience, obedience was important.###speakera73.###yeah,###that has *-1 to be *?* with a day care center.###speakerb74.### and you know so they, you know, they used, uh, oh, i think 0 they used the,
158665:40	i think, i think 0 there's definitely been some changes, um,	definitely	###speakera77.###speakerb78.###uh, i can't remember what they call it *t*-1 actually###but y-, you just stand them in front of a clock###and, you know, it has a second-hand that *t*-1 goes around.###speakera79.###uh-huh.###speakerb80.###and they have *-1 to stand there,###speakera1.###well what do you feel *t*-1 about the, um, present situation in the mideast?###speakerb2.###well, it looks like it's just about as volatile as it usually is *?*.###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.###what do you think *t*-1, mark?###speakera5.###yeah,###i agree.
158666:68	and i think you know, 0 the, the, um, end of the soviet union will definitely have its effect on, on the situation.	definitely	###speakerb78.###uh, i can't remember what they call it *t*-1 actually###but y-, you just stand them in front of a clock###and, you know, it has a second-hand that *t*-1 goes around.###speakera79.###uh-huh.###speakerb80.###and they have *-1 to stand there,###speakera1.###well what do you feel *t*-1 about the, um, present situation in the mideast?###speakerb2.###well, it looks like it's just about as volatile as it usually is *?*.###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.###what do you think *t*-1, mark?###speakera5.###yeah,###i agree.### i think, i think 0 there's definitely been some changes, um,
158793:98	um, you know, over, over the, uh, over, over what, what *t*-1 probably won't accomplish him, accomplish much for him politically.	probably	### i think, i think 0 it was, it was, there were, there were a lot more demographic related interests *ich*-2 involved * than true foreign policy interests.###speakerb56.###right.###speakera57.###um,###speakerb58.###yeah,###well * may have been *?*.###you know, i'm not saying that that's not the case.###uh,###speakera59.###yeah.###and i mean in, in, in along this line since, since, you know it, it really, it really didn't accomplish very much except 0 we're getting, getting, uh, the iraqis out of kuwait.###speakerb60.###right.###speakera61.### i just don't, i just don't, i, i, i d-, i, i, i don't foresee bush making the decision * to invest a lot of manpower and money and, you know, in, in *-1 fighting a second battle.###speakerb62.###no.###speakera63.
159024:12	well maybe, maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that *t*-1's, mumblex come *-3 rolling towards, whatever it's rolling toward *t*-2 *t*-4.	maybe	###everybody says that.###speakerb80.###scientific.###speakera81.###huh.###speakerb82.###heavy science.###speakera83.###speakerb84.###are you like in the particle, particle research or anything like that###or is it more, um, applied physics?###speakera85.###um, i haven't, i haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet.###actually, um, the, the degree 0 i'm getting *t*-1 is physics.###there's a different one for applied physics###so i guess 0 you could call it more *ich*-1 straight stuff than applied.###speakerb86.###okay.###speakera87.###speakerb88.
159024:20	well maybe, maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that *t*-1's, mumblex come *-3 rolling towards, whatever it's rolling toward *t*-2 *t*-4.	maybe	###everybody says that.###speakerb80.###scientific.###speakera81.###huh.###speakerb82.###heavy science.###speakera83.###speakerb84.###are you like in the particle, particle research or anything like that###or is it more, um, applied physics?###speakera85.###um, i haven't, i haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet.###actually, um, the, the degree 0 i'm getting *t*-1 is physics.###there's a different one for applied physics###so i guess 0 you could call it more *ich*-1 straight stuff than applied.###speakerb86.###okay.###speakera87.###speakerb88.
159051:7	or maybe it was on the radi-,	maybe	###actually, i don't think 0 we are *?*.###speakera93.###no,###i don't think so either.###speakerb94.###um, like, like europe, um, england. i know 0 the taxes are a lot higher.###speakera95.###uh-huh.###speakerb96.###speakera97.###uh-huh.###speakerb98.###speakera99.###uh-huh.###speakerb100.###but they do have socialized medicine and things like that.###speakera101.###yeah.###speakerb102.###and, um, i know 0 i was reading in the paper i believe yesterday that, um, they're talking,
159123:27	and i think that, um, they might, you know, pay for that. pay for the classes and stuff	might	###speakerb22.###yeah.###speakera23.###what about you?###speakerb24.###well, um, t-, i-, i'm research stuff here now###so what they, they have, uh, um, okay, benefits package.###it's not quite as good as industry###but one of the significant, um, benefits here is that you can take, uh, up to two courses a semester, um,###and they pay for you know, pay for the classes.###speakera25.###huh.###speakerb26.###so, carnegie mellon that works out *-1 to be, um, a reasonable, a reasonable benefit.###speakera27.###yeah.###speakerb28.###speakera29.###uh, they do that i think 0 *t*-1 if you're, uh, research mumblex here###then i know of some of the people that *t*-1 have gotten their masters
159139:13	so that will probably help out.	probably	###speakerb28.###speakera29.###uh, they do that i think 0 *t*-1 if you're, uh, research mumblex here###then i know of some of the people that *t*-1 have gotten their masters###and i think that, um, they might, you know, pay for that. pay for the classes and stuff###speakerb30.###uh-huh.###speakera31.###but i know 0 they let you, they'll let you decrease how many hours you work *t*-1 by mumblex kind of percentage.###you know, they'll let you work halftime if you want *-1 to, if you want *-2 to finish,###speakerb32.###if you want *-1 to, do it quickly.###speakera33.###you want *-1 to,###speakerb34.###speakera35.###yeah.###they'll let you work, decrease your number of hours by any percentage just, just about###so if you want *-1 to get your masters###and then, i think 0 of course you get like a, with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due
159169:13	but it would definitely be something 0 * to look into *t*-1 once i get my own.	definitely	### i'd, you know, i,###speakera39.###speakerb40.###yeah,### we, we do.###we have *-1 to contribute a certain amount, uh, to it.###speakera41.###uh-huh.###speakerb42.###and it's kind of split *-1 between c m u and, and, you know, the employee.###speakera43.###yeah.###speakerb44.###speakera45.###yeah,###i think, i mean 0 that's pretty, that's a pretty important, uh, part of it there because that, that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems.###speakerb46.###speakera47.### my dad, i think 0 my,###i'm still covered *-1 on, with my dad's, uh, health plan at his, where he works *t*-2,
159266:17	and i think 0 maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous, you know, like millions and millions of dollars.	maybe	###you know, in case, you know, in case you ever need *-1 to bail out.###speakera85.###mumblex help a lot.###speakerb86.###speakera87.###yeah.###see around, around here it's like, uh, we pretty much work from project to project on, well, you know, with different sponsors.###speakerb88.###uh-huh.###speakera89.### there's not, there is not a whole lot of, you know, funded research from,###speakera1.###okay.###so, uh, mike, what are your opinions on, uh, trial by jury *t*-1?###speakerb2.###well i work for an insurance company###so i see a lot of, uh, verdicts that *t*-1 are pretty crazily decided *-2. um, by juries particularly,###and i know 0 in england the judges set all of the awards.###you know juries will decide the guilt or innocence,###but then they leave the awards up to more learned people.
159307:15	i think 0 maybe you look at, uh, the age of the person and their station in life and, and, uh, how much longer *ich*-2 they have *t*-1 of work years that they would have *-3 to put up, you know, with, with that *t*-4.	maybe	###right.### th-, they ha-,###speakerb10.###so it all comes *-1 filtering down to us all in-, individually.###speakera11.###right.###speakerb12.###and, uh, granted 0 some people need *-1 to be compensated *-2 if they have really been wronged *-3, you know.###speakera13.###well, how do you feel *t*-2 about * setting, like, well, for example, a car type accident where, uh, or some incident where someone loses a limb *t*-1.###speakerb14.###speakera15.###do you think 0 the jury should have a dollar figure for * losing an arm, a dollar figure for * losing different body parts?###speakerb16.###i don't know.###you know some of the health insurance is written *-1 that way. you know, that, uh, if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy, you know, it s-, pre specified in the policy so much###but i don't know that you can necessarily put a, a value *ich*-3 on somebody's limb, uh, arbitrarily that *t*-1 is always going *-2 to fit in all cases.###speakera17.###uh-huh.###speakerb18.
159308:13	i mean maybe you don't award an eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year old *t*-1.	maybe	### th-, they ha-,###speakerb10.###so it all comes *-1 filtering down to us all in-, individually.###speakera11.###right.###speakerb12.###and, uh, granted 0 some people need *-1 to be compensated *-2 if they have really been wronged *-3, you know.###speakera13.###well, how do you feel *t*-2 about * setting, like, well, for example, a car type accident where, uh, or some incident where someone loses a limb *t*-1.###speakerb14.###speakera15.###do you think 0 the jury should have a dollar figure for * losing an arm, a dollar figure for * losing different body parts?###speakerb16.###i don't know.###you know some of the health insurance is written *-1 that way. you know, that, uh, if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy, you know, it s-, pre specified in the policy so much###but i don't know that you can necessarily put a, a value *ich*-3 on somebody's limb, uh, arbitrarily that *t*-1 is always going *-2 to fit in all cases.###speakera17.###uh-huh.###speakerb18.###i think 0 maybe you look at, uh, the age of the person and their station in life and, and, uh, how much longer *ich*-2 they have *t*-1 of work years that they would have *-3 to put up, you know, with, with that *t*-4.
159317:34	and that can be part of continuing education *ich*-1, maybe for judges.	maybe	###speakerb14.###speakera15.###do you think 0 the jury should have a dollar figure for * losing an arm, a dollar figure for * losing different body parts?###speakerb16.###i don't know.###you know some of the health insurance is written *-1 that way. you know, that, uh, if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy, you know, it s-, pre specified in the policy so much###but i don't know that you can necessarily put a, a value *ich*-3 on somebody's limb, uh, arbitrarily that *t*-1 is always going *-2 to fit in all cases.###speakera17.###uh-huh.###speakerb18.###i think 0 maybe you look at, uh, the age of the person and their station in life and, and, uh, how much longer *ich*-2 they have *t*-1 of work years that they would have *-3 to put up, you know, with, with that *t*-4.###i mean maybe you don't award an eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year old *t*-1.###speakera19.###huh.###speakerb20.### i, i think 0 it has *-1 to be some kind of common sense applied * there.###and there may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing *t*-2 because they can be schooled *-1 in that kind of thing,###speakera21.###uh-huh.###speakerb22.
159422:5	maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know 0 *t*-1 is hurting people out there	maybe	###speakera59.###uh-huh.###speakerb60.###and unfortunately the ch-, the,###lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for *-1 by insurance too.###speakera61.###uh-huh.###speakerb62.###so again, it never really penalizes, the company doing the wrong.###speakera63.###right.###that will,###speakerb64.###they can go right on *-1 doing the same old thing 0 they always used *-2 to *?* *t*-3.###speakera65.###huh.###speakerb66.###and if, if they know 0 some practice is wrong, you know,###i'm not talking about your isolated occurrences,###i'm talking more about the, you know, the thing that they know *t*-1,
159442:25	but i, i certainly wouldn't want *-1 to send my parent unless it was an absolute last re-, resort.	certainly	###maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know 0 *t*-1 is hurting people out there###and they continue *-1 to do it even after they become aware of that.###speakera67.###sure.###speakerb68.###speakera69.###okay.###speakerb70.###then i think 0 they ought *-1 to have *-2 to pay something out of their own pocket.###speakerb1.###speakera2.###okay.###uh, before a couple of years ago, i had a, a very narrow view of, of nursing homes###and it was, uh, more like a funeral home.###i always joked around about it being a funeral home and not really a nursing home.###and, uh, then i had *-1 to do some volunteer work here in tyler, texas###and i went to one###and it just had a very good activities director.###everyone was cheerful###and now i don't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore.
159657:33	i think 0 i, i might like *-1 dancing to it	might	###speakera9.###yes.###speakerb10.###uh, i like classical music.###i like rock and roll.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###i like country and western.###speakera13.###okay.###speakerb14.###uh, i, i like all kinds.### i like, i like different things about each one of them.###speakera15.###well, i like most of them except for country music.###speakerb16.###oh you don't like country?###speakera17.###no.
159840:39	and, and, you know, he's probably about fifty-three years old now,	probably	###yeah.###speakerb78.###my parents were very musical.###my mother had a piano in the, in the house.###speakera79.###uh,###speakerb80.###speakera81.###uh-huh.###speakerb82.###my father likes, uh, country western music.###speakera83.###okay.###speakerb84.###he's from, uh, west virginia.###so that's what he grew up *-2 listening to *t*-1.###speakera85.###uh-huh.###speakerb86.###and he's always liked it
160007:11	it's probably a long time.	probably	###speakera9.###uh, i work for a fairly large company.###it's got eight thousand people.###speakerb10.###uh-huh.###speakera11.###and, uh, we do have health insurance.###we don't have four o k-, one k plan, stuff like that,###but we do have, like, retirement.###they kind of match up to, you,###if you put six percent, they match up to six percent,###and then the rest is whatever you want *-1 to put *t*-2 in. if you put more than that or something like that.###speakerb12.###oh, that's a pretty good deal.###speakera13.###it's not bad.###speakerb14.###now, how long does it take *t*-1 for your contribution to vest?###speakera15.###god, i don't know.
160410:5	probably mumblex at all.	probably	###yeah,### i'm kind of, i'm kind of bad about it.###speakera39.###the mumblex,###speakerb40.### if i, if * see a, s-, if i see a pile of cans or bottles or something i'll throw it in there,###speakera41.###uh-huh.###speakerb42.###but i don't really, i don't ever take anything.###speakera43.###well, i mean, it's real,###you ought *-1 to *?*, because the, the, the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything.###speakerb44.###uh-huh.###speakera45.###and since we go there all the time, i mean###speakerb46.###but * wait###speakera47.
160631:8	they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened	might	###speakerb4.###uh, i don't watch a lot of it,###but that's the on-,###basically that's my only major source of information.###speakera5.###um.###speakerb6.### what about, what about you?###speakera7.###well, i read, uh,###i get a bunch of different things.###i get a newspaper every day###and i try *-2 to at, at least have a few minutes 0 * to look through that *t*-1###and i look through, uh,###i get a newsweek *ich*-2 every week which i, i pretty much read *t*-1 that cover to cover###and i, as far as, you know,###that satisfies most of the short term news 0 i get *t*-1.###uh, * don't watch much t v,###* don't have enough time###and, uh, * don't listen to the radio *ich*-1 too much especially the news channels or anything like that, you know,
160636:24	uh, but most of my news probably comes from newsweek	probably	###um.###speakerb6.### what about, what about you?###speakera7.###well, i read, uh,###i get a bunch of different things.###i get a newspaper every day###and i try *-2 to at, at least have a few minutes 0 * to look through that *t*-1###and i look through, uh,###i get a newsweek *ich*-2 every week which i, i pretty much read *t*-1 that cover to cover###and i, as far as, you know,###that satisfies most of the short term news 0 i get *t*-1.###uh, * don't watch much t v,###* don't have enough time###and, uh, * don't listen to the radio *ich*-1 too much especially the news channels or anything like that, you know,###they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened###speakerb8.###yeah.###speakera9.###and that's about all 0 i ever hear *t*-1 of it.
160645:23	well, actually, it's, probably isn't less broad,	probably	###i get a newsweek *ich*-2 every week which i, i pretty much read *t*-1 that cover to cover###and i, as far as, you know,###that satisfies most of the short term news 0 i get *t*-1.###uh, * don't watch much t v,###* don't have enough time###and, uh, * don't listen to the radio *ich*-1 too much especially the news channels or anything like that, you know,###they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened###speakerb8.###yeah.###speakera9.###and that's about all 0 i ever hear *t*-1 of it.###uh, but most of my news probably comes from newsweek###and for the longer term i, i read, uh, like scientific american and, and, uh, readers' digest and some of those other types of magazines that *t*-1 come out which, they,###the news isn't, like, immediate what you'd generally think of *t*-1 as news,###but it's recent material.###speakerb10.###and it's more in depth.###speakera11.###yeah,### it is, it is more in depth, less broad.
160685:48	i, you know, they, they certainly have a very similar, uh, charter at least in my mind.	certainly	### i do, i do, too.###speakera19.###and, then there's nothing that, you know, *t*-1 really is like oh, so exciting.###speakerb20.###yeah,###you may find one little, uh, news item interesting###so you have *-1 to wait twenty minutes *-2 to, to hear about it.###speakera21.###yeah,### that, that's about what it ends up *-1 being *t*-2.###* listen to the news *-1 to hear the traffic report or something.###speakerb22.###yeah,###actually, y-, you mention newsweek,### i, i, i do like, uh, u s news and world report.###i don't get *-1 to read it as much as i like,###but that's, i think 0 that's a good magazine.###speakera23.###yeah,###i think 0 they're about the same.
160719:28	uh, it, we might also be helped *-1, though, because it, it *exp*-2 will be easier * to do business over there, too.	might	###but we've yet *-1 to see it###and th-,###it's real short term yet, though,###i mean, it's only been, three months or something like that since that happened###speakerb30.###oh, yeah.###speakera31.###so,###speakerb32.###yeah.###speakera33.###but they like *-1 to tell us that it's going *-2 to be important.###speakerb34.### i'm, i'm pretty sure 0 it is *?*, because, uh once, once europe becomes unified and, uh, their economy becomes one big economy we're going *-1 to be, uh, kind of hurting.###speakera35.###i think 0 it is *?*, too.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###yeah,### i, i think 0 that's a possibility,
160722:4	definitely.	definitely	###i mean, it's only been, three months or something like that since that happened###speakerb30.###oh, yeah.###speakera31.###so,###speakerb32.###yeah.###speakera33.###but they like *-1 to tell us that it's going *-2 to be important.###speakerb34.### i'm, i'm pretty sure 0 it is *?*, because, uh once, once europe becomes unified and, uh, their economy becomes one big economy we're going *-1 to be, uh, kind of hurting.###speakera35.###i think 0 it is *?*, too.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###yeah,### i, i think 0 that's a possibility,###uh, it, we might also be helped *-1, though, because it, it *exp*-2 will be easier * to do business over there, too.###speakerb38.###yeah,
160828:15	which *t*-1 is probably pretty nice,	probably	###we sure do.###here in indiana we pay, uh, we pay county income tax, state income tax,###we pay five percent sales tax,###uh, you name it, they tax it.###speakera5.###oh, so y-, y-, you get the whole smorgasbord.###speakerb6.###that's right###we,###speakera7.###well, i, i actually live in new hampshire###tax free or die.###uh-huh.###speakerb8.###uh-huh.###speakera9.###speakerb10.###right.###speakera11.###speakerb12.
160911:95	well, i, i mean, i think 0 there's some people, there, y-, certainly are some things where you need infrastructure *t*-1	certainly	###and also, you know, then you figure out seven or eight percent for f i c a which *t*-1 is taxes where you,###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###speakera39.###speakerb40.###right.###speakera41.###most people forget about them, because you've g-, you know, you can't always get your f i c a back at the end of the year.###speakerb42.###right.###speakera43.### but, so, you know, and then, you know, like a five percent surtax,###i'm paying forty percent tax.###speakerb44.###yeah,###which *t*-1 is just outrageous###and a lot of it,###and if you look at the way 0 the government is run *-1 *t*-3 these days, it just seems like a lot of it's going to waste.###speakera45.###yeah,
161145:16	schnauzers, in particular probably.	probably	###speakerb36.###you know, the schnauzers are a little aggressive.###speakera37.###they can be nippy.###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###speakera39.###yeah,###shelties are nice.###everybody seems *-1 to be really happy with them.###they're good temperament.###speakerb40.###they're a good temperament###speakera41.###they put up with a lot.###speakerb42.### and they, and they just, uh,###they, i think 0 they have a good head on their shoulders.###i think 0 they have a, a higher level of intelligence than other, uh, dogs that i have encountered *t*-1.###speakera43.
161163:40	that's, that's, maybe that's, there's, uh, some credence in that statement.	maybe	###i think 0 they have a, a higher level of intelligence than other, uh, dogs that i have encountered *t*-1.###speakera43.###schnauzers, in particular probably.###speakerb44.###well, yeah,###speakera45.###speakerb46.###but also some poodles, uh###speakera47.###oh, yeah.###speakerb48.###they're kind of,###there are some smart ones out there,###but there's some also some, uh, not so smart ones.###speakera49.###yeah,###i g-,###it seems 0 * the smaller 0 the are *t*-1, the, the worse off they are *t*-2.###speakerb50.###yeah,
161192:8	they might,	might	###speakerb54.### i, i'd, i really don't know what the best pet is *t*-1.###speakera55.###yeah.###speakerb56.###i guess 0 it's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal *t*-1.###speakera57.###yeah,###i mean, some people seem fairly well suited for for, uh, miniature poodles and such.###speakerb58.###um, and bull dogs.###speakera59.###speakerb60.###speakera61.###speakerb62.###but i don't know about these, uh, these, uh, uh, these pincers, these, now, what are they called *-1 *t*-2. pit bulls, pit bulls that *t*-3 are so vicious.###speakera63.###pit bull.###speakerb64.###speakera65.
161312:23	but i think 0 it was probably a, an individual ferret thing, because it was f-, it was a fairly wild ferret.	probably	###speakerb110.###uh-huh.###speakera111.###i mean, these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret.### the, the ferret is used to *-1 running the house and was kind of wild###speakerb112.###uh-huh.###speakera113.###and, you know, they should expect something like that to happen.###and so bas-,###now it's like ferrets are outlawed *-1 in the town.###speakerb114.###oh, did it attack the child, then?###speakera115.###yeah,### it, it bit him.###speakerb116.###uh-huh.###speakera117.###and that was, that was not a good thing,
161409:18	in other words, they probably would not work, may not, en-, may end up *-1 not working at all d-, in the twenties.	probably	###speakera23.###but if he's a space cadet and doesn't watch the children, and be aware of what the safety hazards are *t*-1,###speakerb24.###oh, exactly.###and the other thing that *t*-1's difficult in, uh, it's *rnr*-2 a too small setting, like a day care center is * to find the right program of enrichment for the child, because you don't want *-3 to just warehouse the child,###and i didn't want *-1 to run an institution where that was the case *t*-2, where all 0 we were doing *t*-3 were warehousing *t*-4 because the first four, five years or so important###and you have *-1 to have the right kind of enrichment###and that, that includes, uh, an atmosphere in which the child is safe and, and he's watched *-1 and his physical needs are cared for *-2 *t*-3,###but also his, uh, developmental needs are cared for *-1, too.###speakera25.###maybe the right thing 0 * to do *t*-1 is * to, uh,###when a couple has a child *t*-2, then they should both take, you say 0 the first four or five years are the most important, and i think 0 i would agree with that, they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting.###speakerb26.###that would be lovely.###speakera27.###* get rid *-1 of all these child care centers, at least for young kids below the age of six.###speakerb28.###uh-huh.###speakera29.### and then, uh, and then, of course, * to make up for that, uh, the, uh, parents would have *-1 to work in their later years longer, you know,
162083:104	uh, well, i, i think 0 the people that *t*-2 run, yeah, that *t*-1 run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical, you know.	probably	###and, uh, she got a couple of inmates that she wasn't, she didn't feel quite as comfortable around *t*-1.###speakerb48.###yeah.###speakera49.###but, well, she had decided that it was, when we came back to the states *t*-1, she decided that it was too,###she didn't feel that public schools were s-, were safe,###so next thing 0 you know *t*-1 she's teaching in a maximum security prison.###speakerb50.###yeah,###right.###speakera51.###but, uh,###speakerb52.###well, at least it's maximum security, right.###speakera53.###yeah.### but, but the point that was, that it, you know,###you said that perhaps, uh, people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible### and, and i'm, i'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people in, that *t*-1 run the system have given up on it *t*-2.###speakerb54.
162249:15	i guess 0 probably the factors 0 we'd use *t*-1 *-2 to compare are a little different because i look for, you know, size and safety, and then mileage.	probably	###speakerb30.###well, i like the miata,###but i don't like it enough *-1 to buy it.###i would buy something,###actually the, the car that i really like *t*-1 right now is an eagle talon, which *t*-2 is an american car.###speakera31.###um.###speakerb32.###but, uh, something along that lines.###speakera33.###interesting.###speakerb34.###uh, because i have a, an economy car *ich*-2 right now, which *t*-1 is okay,###but uh, i think 0 i, i'd like *-1 to move on to something a little better.###speakera35.###yeah.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###that's interesting.###yeah,
162320:66	so, i guess 0 you'd have *-1 to say, 0 if i was looking, i would definitely be looking for a foreign car.	definitely	###speakera61.###speakerb62.###uh, i've had, uh, i've had one or two american cars i think 0 *t*-1,### and, and they were okay.###i had a pontiac once### and, and i never had a problem with it,###but, uh, my mother had a dodge at one point###and i, i had driven it a few times###and i really did not feel that it, that i would buy a dodge j-, just from,###speakera63.###um.###speakerb64.###well, actually, i had a, uh, a dodge omni at one point###speakera65.###uh-huh.###speakerb66.###and that was, i think 0 *-2, what *t*-1 really prejudiced me against american cars was because i did not feel that it was a very quality, uh, car.###speakera67.###yeah.###speakerb68.
162754:7	so maybe it's the law that *t*-1 wrong in their eyes	maybe	###speakera57.###right.###speakerb58.###uh,###speakera59.###and they see all their friends and neighbors, uh,###speakerb60.###and they're accidental parents half the time anyway.###speakera61.###yeah,###and their friends are driving mercedes###and, so it's actually,###they grow up with that as their way of life###and, uh, i think, uh, 0 to a large extent, they don't understand the concept that what they're doing *t*-3 is actually illegal because this is the way 0 they were raised *-1 *t*-2.###speakerb62.###it's illegal,###but it's not wrong because all their friends do it.###speakera63.###right###exactly,
162805:35	and they tend *-1 to view the younger fellows as more likely * to hand down a guilty verdict.	likely	###uh-huh.###speakerb78.###uh, and prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really * to slow,###speakera79.###right.###speakerb80.###speakera1.###well, have you ever served on a jury?###speakerb2.###no,###i've not *?*.###i've been called *-1,###but i had *-1 to beg off from the duty.###and you?###speakera3.###well, i was called *-1###and then i was not chosen *-1.###speakerb4.###um.###well, i was, i was, uh, originally chosen *-1 primarily, i think 0 *t*-2, because i was a young fellow
162822:57	but, there, too, there are also cases in which i feel 0 a majority rule might be acceptable *t*-1, particularly, i think in civil cases.	might	###speakerb4.###um.###well, i was, i was, uh, originally chosen *-1 primarily, i think 0 *t*-2, because i was a young fellow###and they tend *-1 to view the younger fellows as more likely * to hand down a guilty verdict.###i don't know why.###something 0 i picked *t*-1 up in a psychology class some time ago.###speakera5.###oh, really?###speakerb6.###yeah,###it's that * the younger 0 they are *t*-2, they tend *-1 to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason,###and they kind of liked me.###i looked conser-, and all that stuff###and they,###i don't know what they saw *t*-1 in me,###but they saw it.###but, uh, back to the issue,### is, uh,###i don't know,###at times i feel that a unanimous decision is warranted, especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun *t*-1.
162867:10	oh, certainly not,	certainly	###you know, i don't know for, if you're familiar with that or not.###speakera13.###no,###i'm not *?*.###speakerb14.###a, uh, fellow when he was much younger *t*-2, uh, was tried *-1 and convicted *-1 and sentenced *-1 to death.###fortunately, in his case, the death penalty was revoked *-1### and, uh, so he served out his, his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who *t*-1 was making a documentary called * the thin blue line that this guy had basically gotten railroaded *-2 through the judicial system.###the case was reopened *-1###and he was exonerated *-1.###speakera15.###well, i mean, i think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served *-2 *t*-1.###speakerb16.###yeah,###many laws, but little justice.###speakera17.###say,###but, uh,###and i also think, just like you were talking about *ich*-1 before, why you were chosen *-3 to be on a jury *t*-2 that, uh, the, just, the process of * picking jurors is not always objective.###speakerb18.
162868:4	certainly not.	certainly	###speakera13.###no,###i'm not *?*.###speakerb14.###a, uh, fellow when he was much younger *t*-2, uh, was tried *-1 and convicted *-1 and sentenced *-1 to death.###fortunately, in his case, the death penalty was revoked *-1### and, uh, so he served out his, his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who *t*-1 was making a documentary called * the thin blue line that this guy had basically gotten railroaded *-2 through the judicial system.###the case was reopened *-1###and he was exonerated *-1.###speakera15.###well, i mean, i think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served *-2 *t*-1.###speakerb16.###yeah,###many laws, but little justice.###speakera17.###say,###but, uh,###and i also think, just like you were talking about *ich*-1 before, why you were chosen *-3 to be on a jury *t*-2 that, uh, the, just, the process of * picking jurors is not always objective.###speakerb18.###oh, certainly not,
162878:8	they probably have a limit now,	probably	###well, i mean, i think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served *-2 *t*-1.###speakerb16.###yeah,###many laws, but little justice.###speakera17.###say,###but, uh,###and i also think, just like you were talking about *ich*-1 before, why you were chosen *-3 to be on a jury *t*-2 that, uh, the, just, the process of * picking jurors is not always objective.###speakerb18.###oh, certainly not,###certainly not.###and, you know, they like *-1 to think that they're getting someone who *t*-2's objective in all this,###but they're really looking for someone who *t*-1 will pretty much fulfill the lawyers' desires.###you know, the,###because you get up### and, and they ask you a few questions,###both sides do,###and then you, you're either challenged *-2 which *t*-1 is, you know,###each attorney can use that as much as they like *?*###or, i think 0 it's a limit now,
162896:8	you might try, uh,	might	###each attorney can use that as much as they like *?*###or, i think 0 it's a limit now,###they probably have a limit now,###but, they pretty much go through that,###and then you have *-1 to give a reason *ich*-2 to the court why you can't serve *t*-3.###for me, it was financial hardship,### so. but, onto the thing, uh,###i was never aware that juries had any say on * recommending sentencing.###it was always my impression that the justice himself, or herself, had the final say.###speakera1.###okay.###so, what kind of experience *ich*-2 do you, do you have *t*-1, then with child care?###speakerb2.### i guess, i think, uh, i wonder if that worked.###speakera3.###speakerb4.###speakera5.###does it say something?###speakerb6.###i think 0 it usually does.
162909:10	but it might not *?*.	might	### i guess, i think, uh, i wonder if that worked.###speakera3.###speakerb4.###speakera5.###does it say something?###speakerb6.###i think 0 it usually does.###you might try, uh,###i don't know,###* hold it down a little longer,###and * see if it, uh,###speakera7.###okay.###well, does it usually make a recording or s-,###speakerb8.###okay### i, well, i don't remember.###speakera9.###speakerb10.###it seemed like it did,
163216:58	well, you know, uh, * talking about the lawyers, you know what *t*-1 might very well do, uh, cause a, uh, a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that, is * to set the fees for cases.	might	###speakerb22.###you know, that's a,###i've nailed the problem down###but i,###speakera23.###speakerb24.###speakera25.###* leave the details up to somebody else, huh.###speakerb26.###yeah,###i'm going *-1 to have *-2 to leave those details like, what would you do *t*-3 about,###i think, 0 * to begin with, you would h-, you would have,###like, here in atlanta area, our crime rate is just astronomical,###yet, you go out on the streets###and they're giving speeding tickets.###speakera27.###yeah.###speakerb28.###i think 0 somehow you have *-1 to separate the revenues from,###speakera29.
163221:124	now, if he comes in and says, you know, i'll repair your, your v c r, or somebody else's v c r, for a hundred dollars, gets in there, maybe it's a blown fuse,	maybe	###speakerb24.###speakera25.###* leave the details up to somebody else, huh.###speakerb26.###yeah,###i'm going *-1 to have *-2 to leave those details like, what would you do *t*-3 about,###i think, 0 * to begin with, you would h-, you would have,###like, here in atlanta area, our crime rate is just astronomical,###yet, you go out on the streets###and they're giving speeding tickets.###speakera27.###yeah.###speakerb28.###i think 0 somehow you have *-1 to separate the revenues from,###speakera29.###well, you know, uh, * talking about the lawyers, you know what *t*-1 might very well do, uh, cause a, uh, a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that, is * to set the fees for cases.###it's kind of like * do it, do it in the similar vein similar, like, uh, v c r or television repair.###if you take your t v in, a lot of these t v repair places will say, well, i'll repair your t v for a hundred dollars,###and if he gets in there and starts *-1 rooting around and finds something in there that *t*-2's really tremendously wrong with it, then he eats it.### he, he repairs it, gives it back to you, and takes your hundred dollars.
163225:9	so, maybe if we did that with the lawyers, so that, you know, whether it's a murder case or a, you know, a civil, uh, somebody suing somebody else, you get x dollars for that case	maybe	###yeah,###i'm going *-1 to have *-2 to leave those details like, what would you do *t*-3 about,###i think, 0 * to begin with, you would h-, you would have,###like, here in atlanta area, our crime rate is just astronomical,###yet, you go out on the streets###and they're giving speeding tickets.###speakera27.###yeah.###speakerb28.###i think 0 somehow you have *-1 to separate the revenues from,###speakera29.###well, you know, uh, * talking about the lawyers, you know what *t*-1 might very well do, uh, cause a, uh, a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that, is * to set the fees for cases.###it's kind of like * do it, do it in the similar vein similar, like, uh, v c r or television repair.###if you take your t v in, a lot of these t v repair places will say, well, i'll repair your t v for a hundred dollars,###and if he gets in there and starts *-1 rooting around and finds something in there that *t*-2's really tremendously wrong with it, then he eats it.### he, he repairs it, gives it back to you, and takes your hundred dollars.###now, if he comes in and says, you know, i'll repair your, your v c r, or somebody else's v c r, for a hundred dollars, gets in there, maybe it's a blown fuse,###* takes him two minutes,###he fixes it,###he still charges you that hundred dollars.
163353:9	so, maybe that's one thing 0 they can do *t*-1.	maybe	###oh.###speakerb22.###so you don't see too many *ich*-1 thrown * out around the streets. or even bottles.###speakera23.###really.###speakerb24.###speakera25.###speakerb26.###you know, all kinds of bottles they, they, they really charge people * to, i guess 0 *t*-3 when you purchase them *t*-2 and, and then when you turn them back in *t*-1.###speakera27.###right.###speakerb28.### i n-, i remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel *t*-1.###speakera29.###right.###and now, now most of them are throwaway.###speakerb30.###right.###speakera31.###speakerb32.
163675:13	well, that might be the difference.	might	### when i, when i see that money taken * out of my paycheck each, each week, i, or each, every other week *t*-3, i, i really think 0 that money's history###and you know, so as far as return investment, that's not, that's nothing###speakerb6.###yes, uh,###speakera7.###and we're not even going *-1 to get the exact same number of dollars back.###uh, someone was telling me that there is a, uh, uh, there's still an office in, uh, you know, staffed * with, with people *ich*-3 there and, in d c that *t*-1 are researching *-2 to find a cure for polio, which,###i may be wrong,###but i believe that the cure for polio is already founded *-1,### but, but supposedly once you have an office in d c, or, you know, and, and staff it with people, it *exp*-1's really tough * to close it down### and, and they just haven't *?* yet.###speakerb8.###well, yeah,###i'm not exactly sure, uh, about polio in particular.###i know 0 we have a polio vaccine come 0 *t*-2 will prevent somebody from *-1 getting polio###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###i'm not sure if we know what * to do *t*-2 in terms of * curing some who *t*-1 has already gotten polio.###speakera11.
163706:10	but there definitely is, is a problem with,	definitely	###speakera15.###uh-huh.###speakerb16.###and the poor president has, has *-1 to, uh, either accept or reject the whole thing.###speakera17.###so, it sounds like you, uh, you think that, that we'd be able *-1 to save some money by, uh *-2 passing the line item veto.###speakerb18.###oh.###speakera19.###speakerb20.### i, i think 0 the line item veto is not, not, is not necessarily a bad thing, * assuming that the, uh, the, the president, uh, uses it *-2 to get rid *-1 of, uh, this kind of waste.###on the other hand, uh, it, it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your president * not to veto important things. uh, and just to get rid *-2 of the unimportant things.###speakera21.###yeah.###speakerb22.###and whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment *t*-2, there's always going *-3 to be a dispute as to, uh, where the exa-, where the boundary between waste and, and necessity is *t*-1.###speakera23.###uh-huh.###speakerb24.###so i'm not, i'm not sure that, that that will help *-1 solve our problems,
163746:23	it, it definitely is *?*.	definitely	###at least at the end.###speakera31.###uh-huh.###i mean, i don't know,###i,###speakerb32.###yeah,### i-, i-, they were very good at first,###they were in very good financials at first###and, uh, that's part of the reason 0 he became a nominee *t*-1 is because things went so well.###and then, of course, the bottom fell out.###speakera33.### it's, uh, i mean, it's, it's tough.###i mean, there's, there's two ways 0 you can kind of go *t*-1 *-2 to get out of tough financial situations.###i guess 0 you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot###or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and, and whatnot.###speakerb34.###and spare the economy.###yeah,### it's really, it's a hard balance.
163818:14	you know, definitely.	definitely	###they started *-1 getting a little more, you know,###the type of music *ich*-1, at least to me, it's, uh, sounds like it's 0 *t*-2 only sounds good at a high volumes###and i don't like *-1 listening at high volumes.###speakerb22.###yeah.###yeah.###speakera23.###but, uh, some of their older s-, stuff was, uh, you know, quite enjoyable to me.###speakerb24.###yeah,###well they,###speakera25.###you know, ho-, hotel california and that era.###speakerb26.###yeah,###yeah### that does, that's something 0 you don't, *t*-1 doesn't even sound good *-2 loud really. you know.###speakera27.###yeah.###speakerb28.
163819:79	uh, so, anything new 0 you like *t*-1 *ich*-3 *ich*-4 coming out now, other than folk music, some 0 i might know of *t*-2.	might	###the type of music *ich*-1, at least to me, it's, uh, sounds like it's 0 *t*-2 only sounds good at a high volumes###and i don't like *-1 listening at high volumes.###speakerb22.###yeah.###yeah.###speakera23.###but, uh, some of their older s-, stuff was, uh, you know, quite enjoyable to me.###speakerb24.###yeah,###well they,###speakera25.###you know, ho-, hotel california and that era.###speakerb26.###yeah,###yeah### that does, that's something 0 you don't, *t*-1 doesn't even sound good *-2 loud really. you know.###speakera27.###yeah.###speakerb28.###you know, definitely.
163870:58	late, late sixties, early seventies, they were they were definitely pushing a message.	definitely	###yeah,###i think 0 some of them, the artists are even, uh, hitting the pop charts.###speakerb40.###yeah,### it's, it *exp*-1's kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is *?*.###concert tours for country and western sings is, it's, it's quite, quite odd,###but, uh, i don't know,### it's, music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays, i think 0 *t*-1.###it's becoming not necessarily good music, just popular music, you know.###speakera41.###hey,### i, i, i think 0 most artists are in *-1 to make a few bucks.###speakerb42.###yeah,###and that's all 0 it,###speakera43.###but they're not in it *-1 to say anything or give a message which *t*-2 is what they were do-,###speakerb44.###yeah.###speakera45.
163985:10	so you definitely get *-1 to try before you buy.	definitely	###speakerb74.###and i listen to it that way,###but as far as,###yeah,###i don't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless i've heard it.###speakera75.###yeah,###see, that's one thing 0 i like *t*-1 about the, uh, some of the folk music scenes, you know,###there's a couple of nice, uh, small coffee houses up in new jersey.###speakerb76.###yeah.###speakera77.###and, it's very nice,###you go into the coffee house###and, you know, an artist is there###and very often the artist will have a d-, an album###and, so if you like the artist, you buy the album.###speakerb78.###yeah.###speakera79.
163989:11	that's definitely	definitely	###i don't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless i've heard it.###speakera75.###yeah,###see, that's one thing 0 i like *t*-1 about the, uh, some of the folk music scenes, you know,###there's a couple of nice, uh, small coffee houses up in new jersey.###speakerb76.###yeah.###speakera77.###and, it's very nice,###you go into the coffee house###and, you know, an artist is there###and very often the artist will have a d-, an album###and, so if you like the artist, you buy the album.###speakerb78.###yeah.###speakera79.###so you definitely get *-1 to try before you buy.###speakerb80.###yeah,###yeah,
164006:11	that's probably not true only for atlanta, but for just about anywhere.	probably	###speakerb80.###yeah,###yeah,###that's definitely###i,###speakera81.###you know, it,### you, you, you don't always quite get it right,###speakera1.###uh, well, i'm not sure how it is in georgia *t*-1,###but in, in pittsburgh the r-, the crime rate really is not very high at the moment.### is that, is that true for, for atlanta?###speakerb2.###atlanta is kind of high.###uh, it's, it's lower than it has been *?* in the past.###uh, i guess 0 nineteen ninety is when it start *-2 to drop off *t*-1,###and usually around the christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher *t*-1.###speakera3.###yeah,###i,
164013:18	what *t*-1's more likely *-2 to occur is, uh, robbery of, uh, you know, * knocking over a, a small store or a car theft, you know, it, things of that nature.	likely	### you, you, you don't always quite get it right,###speakera1.###uh, well, i'm not sure how it is in georgia *t*-1,###but in, in pittsburgh the r-, the crime rate really is not very high at the moment.### is that, is that true for, for atlanta?###speakerb2.###atlanta is kind of high.###uh, it's, it's lower than it has been *?* in the past.###uh, i guess 0 nineteen ninety is when it start *-2 to drop off *t*-1,###and usually around the christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher *t*-1.###speakera3.###yeah,###i,###that's probably not true only for atlanta, but for just about anywhere.###speakerb4.###yeah.###uh, what kind of crime problem do you usually run into *t*-1?###any specifics?###speakera5.###well, uh, the least, what, from what *t*-2's on the news, uh, there are very few, like actual robberies reported *, uh, uh, of, of residences.
164154:58	but, uh, realistically with, uh, the need * to take the kids to school, * probably have *-1 to have something that, uh, *t*-2 wouldn't wined up *-3 putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat *t*-4.	probably	###it's got a, uh, five year loan,###so that's still got a couple years 0 *t*-1 to run###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###and the car 0 i get *-1 to drive *t*-2 is a, uh, nissan sentra that *t*-3's going *-4 to be ten years old next month###so, i think about, uh, *-1 sprucing that up in a couple years if i can *?*.###speakera11.###wow. they get,###speakerb12.###speakera13.###speakerb14.###speakera15.###uh-huh.### what do you think 0 you'll, uh, what kind of a car do you think 0 you'll buy *t*-1 next?###speakerb16.###well, since i just turned forty, i'm thinking about a forty year old man's car, something, uh, something real sporty###speakera17.###uh-huh.###speakerb18.
164161:45	well, i think 0 the next car 0 we get *t*-1 will probably be a,	probably	###speakera11.###wow. they get,###speakerb12.###speakera13.###speakerb14.###speakera15.###uh-huh.### what do you think 0 you'll, uh, what kind of a car do you think 0 you'll buy *t*-1 next?###speakerb16.###well, since i just turned forty, i'm thinking about a forty year old man's car, something, uh, something real sporty###speakera17.###uh-huh.###speakerb18.###but, uh, realistically with, uh, the need * to take the kids to school, * probably have *-1 to have something that, uh, *t*-2 wouldn't wined up *-3 putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat *t*-4.###speakera19.###uh-huh.###speakerb20.###something a little seating room.###how about you?###speakera21.
164169:27	so i think 0 the four door is probably a major requirement	probably	###speakerb16.###well, since i just turned forty, i'm thinking about a forty year old man's car, something, uh, something real sporty###speakera17.###uh-huh.###speakerb18.###but, uh, realistically with, uh, the need * to take the kids to school, * probably have *-1 to have something that, uh, *t*-2 wouldn't wined up *-3 putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat *t*-4.###speakera19.###uh-huh.###speakerb20.###something a little seating room.###how about you?###speakera21.###well, i think 0 the next car 0 we get *t*-1 will probably be a,###well i, i like buicks.###we have a buick century now,###it's a nineteen eighty-seven###speakerb22.###uh-huh.###speakera23.###and, uh, whatever i get *t*-1, i want *-2 to have, uh, air bags, uh, both driver's and passenger side and four door because it's much more convenient *ich*-4 if you're carrying anybody to, you know, rather than * have them stoop down *-3 to get over,
164182:23	and i think 0 that's probably a little over kill for this day and age.	probably	###well i, i like buicks.###we have a buick century now,###it's a nineteen eighty-seven###speakerb22.###uh-huh.###speakera23.###and, uh, whatever i get *t*-1, i want *-2 to have, uh, air bags, uh, both driver's and passenger side and four door because it's much more convenient *ich*-4 if you're carrying anybody to, you know, rather than * have them stoop down *-3 to get over,###so i think 0 the four door is probably a major requirement###speakerb24.###sure.###speakera25.###and, other than that, uh, you know, reasonable cost and safety and, uh, as much economy as you can get *?* out of a car.###uh, you know, i'm not looking for one with a great big engine, uh###speakerb26.###sure.###speakera27.###something that *t*-1 will carry it around careful, i guess 0 *t*-3 is best, best way 0 * to describe it *t*-2.###right now, we've got a v six###and it, that seems *-1 to be just fine.###i know 0 they s-, they're coming out with some v eight now
164212:57	and i figure 0 if it's so bad that i need a four wheel drive, i probably ought *-1 to be home anyway.	probably	###right.### i, uh, i drive a, a truck, a ford truck.### i, i like trucks because they're spacious,###and it's handy * to haul things.###uh, it's not related to my business,###i just really use it, basically, for transportation,###but there's so many occasions when i've had *-1 to move some members of the family or do this or that *t*-2,###and it's it *exp*-1's handy * to have a truck and not have * to borrow one.###speakerb32.###sure.###speakera33.###speakerb34.###is, uh, traction much of an issue for you up there.###speakera35.###traction?###speakerb36.###mumblex.###speakera37.###uh, not really, uh, you know,###it's a two wheel drive truck
164255:132	so, i know 0 if we were, if we had kids still at home, we're in our fifties now, but, if we had kids still at home, we'd certainly have *-1 to seriously consider a van just for their functional value.	certainly	###speakerb46.###and, uh, we're pleased with it in terms of comfort, and, uh, driveability.###fuel economy isn't great, * being a mini van,###but, uh it's real nice for * carrying around our kids and others###and it's, uh, got some nice features in terms of * being able *-1 to remove seats and flip them around###speakera47.###right.###speakerb48.###so we've been able *-1 to do some real creative, uh, load hauling when * called upon *-2 *t*-3.###speakera49.###one of my sons has a, a plymouth, uh, van or, you know, uh, uh, that same type of thing, the voyager, i guess###speakerb50.###uh-huh.###speakera51.###speakerb52.###right.###speakera53.###and, uh, they have a, a child that *t*-1's five years old###and it's really handy for * hauling him *ich*-1 around and, and their stuff,###and, of course, as he gets friends, i'm sure 0 *t*-1 that will be even handier.
164273:58	uh, again, like you, if conditions are, are that bad, i probably don't want *-1 to be driving anyway.	probably	###and it's really handy for * hauling him *ich*-1 around and, and their stuff,###and, of course, as he gets friends, i'm sure 0 *t*-1 that will be even handier.###so, i know 0 if we were, if we had kids still at home, we're in our fifties now, but, if we had kids still at home, we'd certainly have *-1 to seriously consider a van just for their functional value.###speakerb54.###yeah,###i think that we're going *-1 to be, uh, owning a mini van for some years 0 *t*-2 to come.###probably till the kids are out of, uh, high school anyway.###speakera55.###what about, uh, all wheel drive?###is that something that you'd be interested in *t*-1###or is that,###speakerb56.###uh i'd be satisfied with a, a good front wheel drive car when it comes time 0 * to replace the sentra *t*-1 *t*-2.###speakera57.###uh-huh.###speakerb58.###and *-1 even as, as light as that is *?* with, uh, the small tires it's, it's done pretty well in winter,###speakera59.###uh-huh.###speakerb60.
164282:15	oh, boy, probably, uh, robberies, people stealing from each other.	probably	###is that something that you'd be interested in *t*-1###or is that,###speakerb56.###uh i'd be satisfied with a, a good front wheel drive car when it comes time 0 * to replace the sentra *t*-1 *t*-2.###speakera57.###uh-huh.###speakerb58.###and *-1 even as, as light as that is *?* with, uh, the small tires it's, it's done pretty well in winter,###speakera59.###uh-huh.###speakerb60.###uh, again, like you, if conditions are, are that bad, i probably don't want *-1 to be driving anyway.###speakera61.###right.###speakerb62.###so i know 0 i'd be happy with a, a reasonable, uh, four door.###you know, again, we've, we've got the same issue with *-1 getting kids into the,###speakera1.###what kind of crime do you think, uh, 0 *t*-1 is the most prevalent in our society?###speakerb2.
164309:21	well, actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor,	probably	###you know, everybody has *-1 to pay for it indirectly eventually.###speakera5.###yeah,### i, i, i wonder if, uh, if drug use is a more prevalent crime, though, because, i mean, so many people use it,###and even though * just using is not really,###i mean it is a crime,###speakerb6.###oh, well, yeah,### that, that, that is a crime.###i guess, uh, 0 when you, when you count all the little things that people do *t*-1 like *t*-2,###uh, speeding is a crime.###speakera7.###well, that's true.###speakerb8.###i break that law every day.###speakera9.###but i was, i, i was staying in the realm of, of felonies versus misdemeanors and, uh, drug use,###speakerb10.###uh-huh.###speakera11.
164415:10	and society probably, too.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakera41.###well, yeah,###i mean, the system isn't perfect,###i mean, it's run *-1 by a bunch of imperfect humans.###speakerb42.###speakera43.###you do the best 0 you can *?* *t*-1 *-2 to make it perfect, you know,### you, you go out of your way *-1 to try real hard *-2 to make it perfect.###speakerb44.###right.###speakera45.###but, i think 0 you have *-1 to accept some of the errors.###i think that murder itself would decrease significantly if, if there was a credible punishment, uh, for murderers.###speakerb46.###um, yeah,###i don't know if it would *?* or not though.### i, i don't think 0 it's a, so much of a deterrent as, as it is a, a good, uh, a good way for vengeance, you know, for the relatives and, and family members,###you know what i mean *t*-1?###speakera47.
164445:57	but, i, y-, y-, you might be able *-1 to, uh, stop people, you know,	might	###speakerb52.###speakera53.###yeah,###it does### and, and it decreases the prison population. and, which *t*-1 is significant###speakerb54.###speakera55.###speakerb56.###yeah,###i know that a, a lot of the lot of murders that you hear about *t*-1 are people that *t*-2 know each other.###speakera57.###speakerb58.###speakera59.###i mean,###yeah.###speakerb60.###and they're the, kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that.###speakera61.###speakerb62.###i don't think 0 you'll ever stop all that stuff dead,
164469:23	they could p-, probably do it again.	probably	###yeah,###generally the crimes of passion and things like that, uh, are not premeditated.###speakerb64.###right.###speakera65.###i mean, they can be *?*,###but usually they aren't *?*.###speakerb66.###yeah.###speakera67.###they're spur of the moment###speakerb68.###that's right.###speakera69.###and, uh, the premeditated murders, the ones where the person plots and plans *t*-1, when you catch those, those individuals *t*-2, i think that *t*-4 you, you end up with a, uh, uh, how do i want *-5 to, you end up with a s-, you end up with someone who *t*-3's more dangerous to society because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time.###speakerb70.###yeah.###speakera71.###speakerb72.###yeah,
164490:60	and they don't think that, uh, stop and think and say, well, maybe i shouldn't do this, uh, because, uh, i might get the gas chamber or something like that.	maybe	###speakera73.###yes,### they, they would have no problems *-1 doing it again.###speakerb74.###that's right,###they didn't have any time *-1 doing it the first time.###speakera75.###uh-huh.###and i think 0 * locking them up for, you know, fifty years doesn't do a, any good because as a, as a taxpayer, i'm going *-1 to pay, you know, one and a,###speakerb76.###no,###it do-,###speakera77.###speakera1.###okay,###* looks like we're ready *-1 to go.###capital punishment, uh,###the problem 0 i have *t*-1 with capital punishment is that, uh, uh, it's supposed *-2 to be a deterrent to crime,###but i don't think that it really actually does that.###i don't think 0 it deters anybody, because most of the time crimes are, uh, are committed *-1 with a, without any thought to the consequences
164490:98	and they don't think that, uh, stop and think and say, well, maybe i shouldn't do this, uh, because, uh, i might get the gas chamber or something like that.	might	###speakera73.###yes,### they, they would have no problems *-1 doing it again.###speakerb74.###that's right,###they didn't have any time *-1 doing it the first time.###speakera75.###uh-huh.###and i think 0 * locking them up for, you know, fifty years doesn't do a, any good because as a, as a taxpayer, i'm going *-1 to pay, you know, one and a,###speakerb76.###no,###it do-,###speakera77.###speakera1.###okay,###* looks like we're ready *-1 to go.###capital punishment, uh,###the problem 0 i have *t*-1 with capital punishment is that, uh, uh, it's supposed *-2 to be a deterrent to crime,###but i don't think that it really actually does that.###i don't think 0 it deters anybody, because most of the time crimes are, uh, are committed *-1 with a, without any thought to the consequences
164645:31	there's a lot of folks *ich*-2 *ich*-5, probably, that *t*-1 are in prison that, uh, that *t*-4 aren't really a danger to society, huh,	probably	###right.###speakerb64.###but, like i said, if, if someone is, is just pathologically going *-1 to murder people no matter what then i think 0 they should be eliminated *-2 from society.###speakera65.###uh-huh.###speakerb66.###speakera67.###right.###speakerb68.###speakera69.###uh-huh.###speakerb70.###speakera71.###right,###because they're a danger to everybody else.###huh, that's interesting.###i have *-1 to, uh agree with that.###speakerb72.###but,###speakera73.
164654:5	probably more of them then the other way around.	probably	###speakera69.###uh-huh.###speakerb70.###speakera71.###right,###because they're a danger to everybody else.###huh, that's interesting.###i have *-1 to, uh agree with that.###speakerb72.###but,###speakera73.###there's a lot of folks *ich*-2 *ich*-5, probably, that *t*-1 are in prison that, uh, that *t*-4 aren't really a danger to society, huh,###and, uh,###speakerb74.###and a lot of people that *t*-1 are a danger to society that *t*-2 aren't in prison.###speakera75.###right.###speakerb76.###speakera77.###right,
164669:24	so i can assume that you probably watch the t v news.	probably	###speakera75.###right.###speakerb76.###speakera77.###right,###probably more of them then the other way around.###interesting.### i don't, i don't,###not sure### i, i'm in washington, d c or at least very close to it.###i'm not sure what kind of, uh, capital punishment we have *t*-1 here.###speakerb78.###well, i know 0 in north carolina, we do have capital punishment.###speakera79.###uh-huh.###speakerb80.###and i'm in, i'm from south carolina.###speakera1.###so how do you, uh,### so, so, it sounds like you've got a television going on there,
165004:35	and, uh, one of the things that *t*-1 probably would have been better if, is if the entire county had had, had just one school system.	probably	###speakerb14.###uh, i grew up in new york###and uh, the place,###speakera15.###wow.###speakerb16.###or not new york city, upstate new york###speakera17.###uh-huh.###speakerb18.###and i went to, uh, the city of rochester school district###speakera19.###uh-huh.###speakerb20.###and s-, a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs###and it wasn't, we weren't too far removed *ich*-1 geographically from each other,###but the difference in schools i think 0 *t*-1 was pretty substantial###speakera21.###uh-huh.###speakerb22.
165043:12	and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is *t*-1. you know,	might	###and the, the problem with that is 0 then, then, then people will either, the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they'll move farther away *-1 to get better schools.###speakera29.###yeah.###speakerb30.###speakera31.###right.###speakerb32.###so, you know it, it's kind of, 0 you end up * chasing, like a dog chasing its own tail sort of.###speakera33.###also, uh, the, the family environment,###you know, you can come to south tyler where i live *t*-1###and you have got room mothers in every room,###you've got art mothers,###you've got every, every holiday,###there's parties.###all these kids have these really supportive, really supportive parents, always up there for something.###speakerb34.###yeah.###speakera35.###you can go to north tyler to the schools
165112:74	and i think 0 the difference for me was that my parents were, you know, they were definitely, they were always there,	definitely	###they have *-1 to have guidance###and uh, they can't just have it at school and then come home###speakerb54.###uh-huh.###speakera55.###and there's nothing, you know.###speakerb56.###yeah,###yeah.###yeah,###i know that that, that was a big factor for me.###i ended up *-1 coming out of, of the public school system very well###and * was very good education, uh,###speakera57.###uh-huh.###speakerb58.###* ended up *-1 getting some scholarships 0 * to go to college *t*-2 and which *t*-3 has been, you know, which *t*-4 is really nice,###speakera59.###uh-huh.###speakerb60.
165149:13	and it was probably made *-1 in china by slaves.	probably	###and they were real good about *-1 taking it back.###it wasn't a problem at all,###so, uh, i was able *-1 to get that back pretty easily.###speakerb3.###uh-huh.###speakera4.###but, uh, i don't know,###i really haven't returned a whole lot lately.###have you *?*?###speakerb5.###i haven't had *-1 to *?*.###it's, uh, the,###every so often, i mean, i, i, i'm almost pushing it myself.###maybe i'll buy a shirt from g i joe's###and it shrinks too much###and * say, well, i should have known better,###i mean, i bought it from g i joe's###speakera6.###um.###speakerb7.
165168:11	it's probably a japanese *rnr*-1 or a burmese *rnr*-1 company owning and hiring people in the u s.	probably	###speakerb7.###and it was probably made *-1 in china by slaves.###speakera8.###right.###speakerb9.###but, uh, they, uh,###most of the time mumblex pretty careful shopping anyway,###i get pretty good stuff.###speakera10.###yeah.###speakerb11.###i think that, uh, aside from the fact 0 all markets being internationalized *-1###speakera12.###right###like,###speakerb13.###and if you want *-1 to buy american, it takes real extra work 0 * to find *t*-2.###speakera14.###exactly.###speakerb15.
165175:91	they were talking about cars, uh, the car issue just came out. and about how, yeah, you'd like *-1 to buy an american car maybe *t*-2	maybe	###i get pretty good stuff.###speakera10.###yeah.###speakerb11.###i think that, uh, aside from the fact 0 all markets being internationalized *-1###speakera12.###right###like,###speakerb13.###and if you want *-1 to buy american, it takes real extra work 0 * to find *t*-2.###speakera14.###exactly.###speakerb15.###it's probably a japanese *rnr*-1 or a burmese *rnr*-1 company owning and hiring people in the u s.###speakera16.###i was reading,###speakerb17.###speakera18.###right,###i was reading something in, uh, consumer reports *ich*-1 tonight about that as a matter of fact.
165226:17	may-, maybe they're getting better,	maybe	###uh-huh.###speakera30.###uh, they've got all the american, well, all the, all the cars rated *-1, you know,###and, uh, essentially, i h-, i don't see much of a trend.###i mean, just like every other time that you look at it *t*-1, the honda accords and the civics are right up there.###there's nothing wrong with them.###uh, and the same thing with most of the other japanese cars.###but then again you look at a ford or especially a chevy###and they're pieces of junk.###speakerb31.###i know.###still at it,###hey.###speakera32.###yeah,### that's ninety, that's eighty-six through ninety-one.###speakerb33.###wow.###speakera34.###but, uh, i don't know,
165227:5	maybe they're starting *-1 to get a clue.	maybe	###speakera30.###uh, they've got all the american, well, all the, all the cars rated *-1, you know,###and, uh, essentially, i h-, i don't see much of a trend.###i mean, just like every other time that you look at it *t*-1, the honda accords and the civics are right up there.###there's nothing wrong with them.###uh, and the same thing with most of the other japanese cars.###but then again you look at a ford or especially a chevy###and they're pieces of junk.###speakerb31.###i know.###still at it,###hey.###speakera32.###yeah,### that's ninety, that's eighty-six through ninety-one.###speakerb33.###wow.###speakera34.###but, uh, i don't know,### may-, maybe they're getting better,
165231:8	it probably won't start *-1 really showing up until ninety-four or so.	probably	###there's nothing wrong with them.###uh, and the same thing with most of the other japanese cars.###but then again you look at a ford or especially a chevy###and they're pieces of junk.###speakerb31.###i know.###still at it,###hey.###speakera32.###yeah,### that's ninety, that's eighty-six through ninety-one.###speakerb33.###wow.###speakera34.###but, uh, i don't know,### may-, maybe they're getting better,###maybe they're starting *-1 to get a clue.###uh,###speakerb35.###well, they got a three year lead time.
165235:46	technology that *t*-1 comes in right now is, is probably not going *-2 to be imple-, implemented *-3 until, you know, quite a few years down the road.	probably	###speakerb31.###i know.###still at it,###hey.###speakera32.###yeah,### that's ninety, that's eighty-six through ninety-one.###speakerb33.###wow.###speakera34.###but, uh, i don't know,### may-, maybe they're getting better,###maybe they're starting *-1 to get a clue.###uh,###speakerb35.###well, they got a three year lead time.###it probably won't start *-1 really showing up until ninety-four or so.###speakera36.###yeah,###that's just it.
165253:14	or, uh, maybe i say, well, you know, you paid five hundred bucks for this program,	maybe	###yeah,###that's just it.###technology that *t*-1 comes in right now is, is probably not going *-2 to be imple-, implemented *-3 until, you know, quite a few years down the road.###but, uh,###speakerb37.###the computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer *t*-1.###speakera38.###oh, yeah.###yeah,###because technology is so, uh, you know, volatile and changing all the time.###speakerb39.###and can you think of any other industry where###in software they,###speakera40.###uh,###speakerb41.###if the product is upgraded *-2 and a better version is put *-1 out, you'll get a free version in the mail s-, mumblex.###speakera42.###yeah.###speakerb43.
165315:29	they issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with floppy drive.	possibly	###speakerb61.###speakera62.### yeah,###yeah###that's true, too.###speakerb63.###speakera64.###but, uh, i don't know,### i'm really, i've gotten a little bit out of the, the personal computer business just because i don't have one at home.### i, i do use a mac at work###but, uh uh, i really don't, don't do much with it at home###speakerb65.###uh-huh.###speakera66.###but, uh,###speakerb67.###apple's sort of making a s-,###and they're ones were###growling consumer, uh, need * to worry about the mac 0 they're getting *t*-1,###like if you bought a power book straight off, a lot of them had *-1 to go back.
165381:7	or maybe it *exp*-1 was thirty dollars * to do it	maybe	###i have a nineteen eighty-four nissan truck###i had a tune up done *-1###and i had, i had the brakes *ich*-2 done *-1 on it###and then, the reason 0 i did that *t*-1 was because i don't have a scope###and it has eight spark plugs###and it *exp*-1's hard * to, to get get at them###and plus the time on them.###i just don't have time any more.###uh, as far as maintenance tasks that i do *t*-1 myself, i, i usually change the oil and wash the air filter###and i, i had an occasion 0 * to change, to have *-2 to change the battery *t*-1 once,###but, the brakes, i was really surprised that the brakes.###i wanted,###i do have the background.###i know what *t*-1 needs *-2 to be done *-3###and i know that the oil *ich*-2 needs, should be changed *-1 very regularly and all of the bearings###and the lube, lubrication system needs *-1 to be lubricated *-2###and so i, i stay on top of that###but i i wanted my front wheels,###i wanted the bearings packed *-1###and they wanted something like fifteen dollars, uh, a front or something like that
165409:24	i'm, you might say 0 i'm, uh, uh, good back yard mechanic	might	###the other thing 0 i let them do *t*-1 some times is that i let them go through and let them tell me what, let them do the diagnostics.###that's free,###okay.###and then i can decide whether i want them to do it or whether i can do it, see.###speakerb4.###right.###speakera5.###and they told me that my, my brake pads were gosh, you know, seventy percent still good, you know,###but still it was cheaper in the long run###and uh,###so i just got the the brakes done *-1###and i thought 0 that was a good deal.###and plus###speakerb6.###right.###and they repacked the wheel bearings.###speakera7.###and they re-, repacked the the wheel bearings.###yeah###but, uh, i've, i've had considerable experience.
165432:122	and then if you go and like, just about any point, any you know point in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil, the oil is you might say, uh, a white golden brown.	might	###but i, i still have a pretty good feel for it,###but one thing 0 i didn't know *t*-1 is that when i was messing around with cars and stuff *t*-2 and most of the cars,### i, i had bigger cars###and the brakes *ich*-1 go out fairly rapidly on those###and what i was surprised at *t*-1 is that on my little nissan###i bought the truck with about sixty thousand,###i have almost one hundred and ten,###so i drove on those brake pads for, uh, you know, forty-five thousand miles###and there was hardly any wear to them.###so those small little trucks and cars like that, they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good.###speakerb8.###you know, they've gotten to the point that where they don't weigh very much *t*-1###and the the surface materials on the pads is so good.###speakera9.### exa-, exactly,###speakerb10.###speakera11.###so i, you know, i just did it anyway.### i like *-2 to, i like *-1 to stay up on it.###you know, like i just kind of stay up on it
165482:16	and, uh, probably about four months ago the water pump decided *-1 to go out.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###uh, the only catch was 0 the first set of under drive pulleys that i put *t*-1 on it were, uh, not even cast aluminum.###they were just pressed aluminum.###speakera27.###you're talking about the vibration dampener?###speakerb28.###well, there's three, there's three pulleys that you change *t*-1.###you change the crank pulley the alternator pulley and, uh, the water pump pulley.###speakera29.###that's the vibration dampener,###yeah.###speakerb30.###speakera31.###okay.###speakerb32.###so, when i changed those over *t*-1, i put on these, these pressed aluminum things###speakera33.###um.###speakerb34.
165813:70	actually that's kind of the type of car that i, i'm thinking about 0 we might get *t*-1.	might	###but, uh, budgeting.###i found, you know, 0 i feel a lot better.###you know, we use *-1 to work out of one check book###speakera110.###uh-huh.###speakerb111.###and it would be very hard for me because i wouldn't have, i wouldn't have any idea how much money i was spending *t*-1 in one month.###speakera112.###yeah.###speakerb113.###now, i have, know exactly what i'm spending *t*-1###and it's so much easier,###speakera1.###so. have you heard about saturns?###speakerb2.###i've heard some about saturns.###i don't know a lot about them.###i haven't been over, uh, to a dealer *-2 to look at them although i did see something in tonight's paper that *t*-1 said that their, uh reliability is rated *-3 to be equal to that of the, i guess, the japanese cars.###speakera3.###ooh, that's great.
165891:56	and that's kind of, that's, that's probably one thing 0 i'd look at *t*-1.	probably	###speakera25.###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###and i find that for a normal, you know, everyday things. it's really very easy 0 * to work on *t*-1###and so, uh, you know, i'm kind of spoiled.###i used *-1 to have a mumblex chevy.###speakera27.###uh-huh.###speakerb28.###with a three fifty in it.###speakera29.###yeah.###speakerb30.###and, uh, i really liked *-1 working on it. uh, cause it was pretty easy too.###it was about a nineteen seventy.###so i'm kind of, uh, biased in that###and, you know, i want a car that i can work on *t*-1 because i think 0 it just costs too much * even to get the oil changed *-2 anymore.###speakera31.###yeah.###speakerb32.
166030:35	and the majority of the incentive in * recycling bottles probably, * believe it or not, is just * to get the extra nickel at the, uh, the store and not, uh,	probably	###uh-huh.###well that's more than we have *?* up here in massachusetts.### some, some local communities are very active in that, uh, in that respect###and they do have bins set * up.###but i live in a, a metropolitan area###and, uh, they're not, uh, too inclined *-1 to do something as aggressive as that.###speakerb4.###well, here they and,###uh, * live in an apartment complex.###speakera5.###uh-huh.###speakerb6.###and they only have one set of recycling bins, one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters.###so a lot of the people who *t*-1 live up front don't bother *-2 to recycle because, you know, it *exp*-3's too far * to carry the stuff to the other bins.###speakera7.### i, i know 0 a lot, i think 0 a lot of, uh, the, the issues with regard to recycling are that, uh, people have *-1 to be motivated *-2 to do, to do something like that because it does take extra effort.###whether### and, and i think that, and i know 0 massachusetts has,###a bottle bill was passed *-1###and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now,
166067:23	th-, there definitely has *-1 to be a motivation factor	definitely	###mumblex it didn't, it, it took awhile for that bill to be passed *-1 up here as far as * recycling bottles and cans.###uh, and, and matter of fact, i think 0 it took like three tries t-, for it to go through.### but, and it's been pretty successful###and people notice it as far as, uh, highways being, uh, you know,###people would dr-, have a drink of soda,###instead of *-1 throwing out the window, they, they keep the bottle###so it's, it's been a ecologically sound policy and, you know, as, as far as * recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth.###but more importantly, it's recycling reusable materials back into, uh, manufacturing.###and that's the big thing, i think 0 *t*-3, that th-, they try *-1 to promote *t*-2.###speakerb12.###right.###i think 0 here if they, uh, instead of * just, you know, requiring that you put, put out the trash and stuff, if they *ich*-2 could get some kind of rebate, those people who *t*-1 do put the stuff out, uh, you know, and separate it, have lower collection fee or something * may encourage people to separate.###speakera13.###yeah,###that's a good idea.###speakerb14.###speakera15.###yeah.###speakerb16.###speakera17.
166161:13	so there's maybe a five year gap between us.	maybe	###uh,###speakerb16.###speakera17.###um. it depends.###uh, it *exp*-2's hard 0 * to say *t*-1 because i think 0 people were busy ten twenty years ago too.###speakerb18.###uh-huh.###speakera19.###uh, i just,###speakerb20.###well, how, how old are you *t*-1?###speakera21.###i'm twenty-eight.###speakerb22.###twenty-eight.###okay,###i'm twenty-three.###speakera23.###yeah.###speakerb24.
166205:15	i think 0 maybe those people *ich*-4 that *t*-1 really do need *-2 to work, both parents, *-3 just to survive.	maybe	###speakerb36.###i mean do you think, 0 people really need two cars and a house in the suburbs###or,###speakera37.###speakerb38.###speakera39.###no,###no.###i don't.###speakerb40.###speakera41.###no,###i don't think that.###but then there are a lot of people that, that *t*-1 don't have that. but, that really *t*-2 do need *-3 to work.###speakerb42.###uh-huh.###speakera43.###speakerb44.###uh-huh.###speakera45.
166239:50	and then, sometimes i, i often, uh, find that maybe there's so many different things available to us. yo-, a microwave, a v c r, a answering machine a, you know, a special, a dishwasher, uh, a refrigerator and some of those items, um, for the, for the, uh,	maybe	###uh, but i i tend *-4 to think that it's less *ich*-5 those people that *t*-1 have the two cars and everything than it is the group that *t*-2 is just trying *-3 to survive.###speakerb54.### yo-, so you think 0 it's,###which group are you saying 0 *t*-1 is the one trying?###speakera55.###i'm saying that the, uh, the group that *t*-1 is just trying *-2 to survive from day to day, where both parents are working *t*-4 is more of the majority than the, than the people that *t*-3 have the higher standard of living.###speakerb56.###uh-huh.###speakera57.###because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who *t*-1 has the money and who *t*-2 the decreasing, uh, middle class in this country i think that that's, in my opinion, the case.###speakerb58.###uh-huh.###speakera59.###speakerb60.###okay.###speakera61.###so.###i mean i have met people that, uh, both that, that *t*-1 just want *-4 to maintain a, the standard of living and those that, that *t*-2 really need the job.###speakerb62.###okay.
166286:10	and i certainly see how much *ich*-2 i pay *t*-1 in real estate taxes every year.	certainly	###speakera3.###i don't know.###uh, i haven't,###it's been, uh, well seventy-nine since i was at school. at high school.###speakerb4.###uh-huh.###speakera5.###and, uh, i've seen things change.###i don't know if i've seen things change enough that i can actually,###because i wasn't really like listening to the world go by back then###so it *exp*-1's hard * to compare.###you know what i mean *t*-1?###speakerb6.###right.###speakera7.###but, uh, it seems like when i li-, i lived in chicago *t*-1,### i, i've lived down here.###i hear the dropout rates from the schools,###speakerb8.###speakera9.
166372:163	i think that, that if, if there is a problem with the school system, uh, from, it *exp*-4's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well, uh, paid. that perhaps that might be one area that, that *t*-2 could be improved *-3.	might	###i agree that * teaching our kids is important.###speakerb30.###right.###speakera31.###however, these people who *t*-1 only work eight hours day at it, from seven to three,###speakerb32.###speakera33.###and they only work nine months a year###and they get an awful lot of breaks in between###and that's my tax dollars that i'm spending *t*-1 on that.###and i don't even have kids.###speakerb34.###yeah,###well that's true.###but tha-, there's,###you can always play games with, uh, * talking about, whoa, * look at this.###my tax dollars are paying for this.###this is wrong.###but, when you're talk-, w-, w-,###and there's really not much 0 you can directly do *t*-1 about that.
166418:54	but, uh, i guess 0 if i have, uh, my druthers, i'd probably go for the seattle seahawks.	probably	###well, that that's all right.###speakerb10.###that's my favorite team,###so.###speakera11.###speakerb12.###uh, now that randall's coming back next season, i hope 0 they'll be, do a little bit better.###they didn't do too bad last season.###speakera13.###yeah.###speakerb14.###but, i hope 0 they can do better.###how about yourself?###speakera15.###well, i don't know.###i kind of go back and forth, uh, depending on who *t*-1's really hot and who *t*-2's not *?*.###i guess 0 i'm kind of a fair weather fan in a lot of respects.###speakerb16.###uh-huh.###speakera17.
166445:44	* to be honest with you, i, i probably watch, uh, college a little bit more than i do pro.	probably	###that's another one of my favorites.###speakera21.###yeah.###they're kind of,###speakerb22.### they're not, they're not my favorite totally.###but i do like them.###i like,###yeah.###speakera23.###yo-,###speakerb24.###seahawks are good.###they,###now that steve largent is gone, i kind of lose a little bit for them###but you know, he,###speakera25.###yeah.###speakerb26.###speakera27.
166480:8	you probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then.	probably	###speakera33.###is it *?*?###speakerb34.###they do, you know,###it's more high tech,###more, you know, players are apt *-1 to act a little bit different when they, when their jobs and their, when it's a job and not just, you know###speakera35.###yeah,###yeah.###that could be.###speakerb36.###when you're getting paid *-1 millions * to do it *t*-2, you ac-, i think 0 they take it to another level.###speakera37.###yeah.###speakerb38.###but i can see 0 it's more, you know, grunted out, * run the ball type.###college football is a little bit different###but,###speakera39.###yeah.
166504:41	well, i can see, i can see definitely how you get into that *t*-1.	definitely	###speakerb42.###notre dame?###speakera43.###no.###i root for nebraska quite a bit.###speakerb44.### n-, nebraska.###yeah###there's a running team.###speakera45.###ye-,.###speakerb46.###yeah.### that, that, that's boring for me.### i, i'll take the passing teams any day.###speakera47.###yeah.###speakerb48.###but,###speakera49.
166617:30	there's an element there's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere.	definitely	###i've like *-1 to watch, rugby every now and then.###speakerb80.###speakera81.###speakerb82.###yeah###or australian rules football.###that's,###speakera83.###yeah,###whatever you want *-1 to call it *t*-2 there.###speakerb84.###yeah.###that's some brutal stuff there.### that's, that's worse than football as far as violence i think 0 *t*-1.###golly.###those guys kill each other out there.###rugby is something else.###speakera85.###yeah, mumblex.###yeah,
166625:11	rugby is definitely big in college because it's something 0 a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do *t*-1.	definitely	###yeah,###whatever you want *-1 to call it *t*-2 there.###speakerb84.###yeah.###that's some brutal stuff there.### that's, that's worse than football as far as violence i think 0 *t*-1.###golly.###those guys kill each other out there.###rugby is something else.###speakera85.###yeah, mumblex.###yeah,### there's an element there's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere.###speakerb86.###yeah.###that's just wild.###that's why it's a go-, a big college thing *t*-1.###speakera87.###yeah###speakerb88.
166973:13	uh, i certainly can't argue with that.	certainly	###speakerb26.### and, uh, but i think that it can be helpful in that, uh, it gets people the level of physical care 0 they need *t*-1. uh,###speakera27.###but i don't, i mean###at least, i mean i think 0 some nursing homes do that.###but i think 0 a lot of nursing homes really, uh, are guilty of neglect.###speakerb28.###yeah.### i th-, and i think 0 it happens more in areas where it's, uh, i guess, uh, a broad social medical system where, uh, you know, there's government medical care and that kind of thing *t*-1 *t*-2.###if it's the lot where it's funded *-1 by the individuals *t*-2### and, and i guess 0 that's sort of my lack of understanding.###i think that a majority of the places in the u s, uh, you know, there is some government aid available,###but the majority of it is to the availability of the individual * to pay.###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb30.###and, uh, if you're not able *-2 to look after yourself, then you have *-1 to rely,###speakera1.###actually, * to tell you the truth, i think, uh, 0 jury selection is a, uh, prime, uh, discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on, uh, uh, finding of, uh, guilt.###speakerb2.
167003:22	and i suppose 0 an elitist might say, well, you really want someone who *t*-1 is well educated *-2 to be able *-3 to, to winnow the facts from the, from the prejudice.	might	###speakerb6.###i think 0 it's, four or five,###speakera7.###but you can *?*,###speakerb8.###i can't remember which.###i was on a jury trial last year###only i got kicked *-2 out as, uh, the last selection that the, uh, defense got *t*-1.###speakera9.###um. yeah,###it seems to me 0 i'm always challenged *-2 peremptorily also when i go to these things *t*-1.###i think 0 i have a severe demeanor or something.###speakerb10.###um.###speakera11.###uh,###speakerb12.###that, uh,###speakera13.###but, typically, you know, basic-, uh, typically, uh, everyone gets involved *-1 in, uh, the jury process
167090:37	well, if it's a second offense, the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense, because obviously, the rehabilitation process did not work the first time.	certainly	###oh, is it *?*?###oh, i didn't realize that.###okay.###speakerb48.###at least in california, they're supposed *-1 to be *?*.###not during the trial,###during the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing 0 * to do *t*-1 with their background.###speakera49.###right.###speakerb50.###but when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going *-1 to lay *t*-2 down *t*-3, i think that, uh, that they should *?*.###speakera51.###uh-huh.###speakerb52.### i don't, i don't know that they always have *?* because i never sat all the way through a jury trial.###they get too boring.###speakera53.###uh-huh.###so, you, what you're saying *t*-1 is this, if there is the second offense, then you execute them.###speakerb54.
167120:28	de-, devil's advocate possibly,	possibly	###i think 0 those ought *-1 to be punished *-1 a whole lot worse than they are *?*.###speakera59.###oh, really?###speakerb60.###yeah.###speakera61.###like what?###speakerb62.###well, uh, say, embezzlement, right.###speakera63.###ri-,###speakerb64.###you get a guy down the street who *t*-1 comes up, uh, *-2 carrying a kni-,###speakerb1.###so, * let's talk about the, uh, wonderful abuses in the state of pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order *t*-1###and after the fact, the state of pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased *t*-2 as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it *t*-1.###what do you think *t*-1?###is pennsylvania kind of out of line there?###speakera2.###well, actually, i don't think 0 they're out of line.
167186:140	if, if i'm a computer consulting firm and i see these, this great deal on forty-six mother boards, uh, from, from say utah. um, i, i might buy the mother boards from utah but then still have *-1 to pay pennsylvania sales tax.	might	###and i, i i was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having, having *-1 to pay sales tax on it.###speakerb15.###speakera16.###speakerb17.###uh.###speakera18.###that's my understanding of the way, uh, the way 0 it works *t*-1.###usually, the, the person ordering doesn't pay.###but the accounting department will, uh, suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have *-1 to pay *t*-2.###and there r-, there are s-, some substantial, nasty penalties, um, if you, if businesses try *-1 to avoid that.###speakerb19.###uh, do you mean businesses from the point of view as, of, of * selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax? or purchasing.###speakera20.###i-, mumblex.###speakerb21.###speakera22.###no.###businesses, uh if * purchasing things mail order,###speakerb23.###speakera24.
167243:76	oh, well, i guess, 0 if i, if it was someone in my family, i'd probably feel that way.	probably	###well,###speakera7.###or should it be used *-1, uh, a-, * to prevent further, uh, crime?###huh.###speakerb8.###yes,###yes.###* to prevent these people from *-1 ever getting out on the street. by, you know, some technicality.###speakera9.###speakerb10.###and they go down the line ten years###and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again *-1 doing the same 0 they did *t*-2 before.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###and, you know, that's about the only thing.###like for petty, for theft and, and stuff like that or manslaughter, you know, i don't think 0 they should do that.###speakera13.###well, you know, there's this old, uh, jewish, is it, saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.###speakerb14.
167248:46	but, but i feel like if i did, i probably would feel that way.	probably	###yes,###yes.###* to prevent these people from *-1 ever getting out on the street. by, you know, some technicality.###speakera9.###speakerb10.###and they go down the line ten years###and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again *-1 doing the same 0 they did *t*-2 before.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###and, you know, that's about the only thing.###like for petty, for theft and, and stuff like that or manslaughter, you know, i don't think 0 they should do that.###speakera13.###well, you know, there's this old, uh, jewish, is it, saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.###speakerb14.###oh, well, i guess, 0 if i, if it was someone in my family, i'd probably feel that way.###speakera15.###speakerb16.###you know, i've never had anybody in my immediate family, uh, murdered *###and so i really wouldn't know.
167280:38	and so, uh, the likelihood that, you know, maybe expected, expected murders by him is, is, uh, integrated *-1 over the income of the people, uh, that he murders *t*-3 is maybe, you know, a loss of, who *t*-4 knows, eight hundred thousand dollars.	maybe	###speakerb22.###well, that's true.###speakera23.###so, you know, if you weight everyone equally, then you have *-1 to say, well the likelihood of * not terminating him,###if you don't terminate him, the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person.###in other words, you'd have * to, you'd have *-2 to murder more than one other person uh, in order * to justify * taking his life.###speakerb24.###besides him.###speakera25.###speakerb26.###okay.###speakera27.###another way 0 you could do it *t*-1 is * weight this value by, uh, the value to society of the people. uh, which *t*-2 is pretty delicate thing 0 * to do *t*-3.###but one way of * doing it is, uh, by income.###so if this guy doesn't make a great deal of money, which *t*-1 is often times the case, then then he's obviously not worth very much###speakerb28.###speakera29.###speakerb30.###his life isn't worth very much then.###speakera31.
167280:141	and so, uh, the likelihood that, you know, maybe expected, expected murders by him is, is, uh, integrated *-1 over the income of the people, uh, that he murders *t*-3 is maybe, you know, a loss of, who *t*-4 knows, eight hundred thousand dollars.	maybe	###speakerb22.###well, that's true.###speakera23.###so, you know, if you weight everyone equally, then you have *-1 to say, well the likelihood of * not terminating him,###if you don't terminate him, the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person.###in other words, you'd have * to, you'd have *-2 to murder more than one other person uh, in order * to justify * taking his life.###speakerb24.###besides him.###speakera25.###speakerb26.###okay.###speakera27.###another way 0 you could do it *t*-1 is * weight this value by, uh, the value to society of the people. uh, which *t*-2 is pretty delicate thing 0 * to do *t*-3.###but one way of * doing it is, uh, by income.###so if this guy doesn't make a great deal of money, which *t*-1 is often times the case, then then he's obviously not worth very much###speakerb28.###speakera29.###speakerb30.###his life isn't worth very much then.###speakera31.
167308:50	of course, a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get *?*, i think 0 *t*-1, in terms of psychological impact.	possibly	###speakerb34.###potential.###i mean that's, that's the key right there. potential.###speakera35.###uh-huh.###speakerb36.###now, are they, are they rehabilitative or, or not.###speakera37.###now that's all fine and well and, and, uh, good philosophical.###but if you're involved yourself, personally###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###speakera39.###uh, i know 0 i have a friend whose, uh, son *t*-1 was murdered *-2, uh, on the night before his sixteenth birthday.###and * let me tell you, uh, i, i knew them personally, uh, not intimately, but quite well###and, uh, you're talking about real trauma. i mean trauma that *t*-1 extends beyond the counting of bodies.###speakerb40.###i can imagine.###speakera41.###the father, you know,
167373:23	and it's preconstructed *-2 you might say 0 *t*-1.	might	###speakera8.###so you're remodeling?###speakerb9.###uh-huh.###speakera10.###okay.###speakerb11.###how about you?###speakera12.###well, i, i just live in a, i live in an apartment now.### i, uh, two summers ago i went to massachusetts###speakerb13.###uh-huh.###speakera14.###and i went with a friend of mine###and we undertook a building house.###speakerb15.###uh-huh.###speakera16.###and this was a, a lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions *t*-1
167434:117	it was sort of just, you know, uh, * gets your, get his, you know, my bro-, my brother and well, maybe, you know, my cousin's coming over today *-1 to help us do that kind of thing. so that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic sometimes.	maybe	###speakerb33.###uh-huh.###speakera34.###speakerb35.###uh-huh.###speakera36.###but it turned, it was okay###and it's only the basement floor###so it was okay.###speakerb37.###yeah.###speakera38.###but, uh, it kept us pretty busy.###it was only, uh,###there was, well me and my friend###and then we just had like two helpers and uh, sort of a, a family type,###speakerb39.###uh-huh.###speakera40.###it wasn't, you know, like a commercial project or something.
167464:30	it's sort of like a farm, you might say 0 *t*-1.	might	###speakera46.###and so we're, we're hopping around pretty good.###but overall, yeah, we got it done *-1###and it's a three bedroom, two bath house###and it's pretty neat.###speakerb47.###nice.###speakera48.###yeah.###so.###speakerb49.###nice.###so, uh, i mean what was it for *t*-1?###you just,###speakera50.###well, it was, uh, for my friend's parents.###they had some property there###and they'd lived in this, this old,###speakerb51.###speakera52.
167631:37	we take, oh, one big vacation a year and then maybe, you know, three small vacations.	maybe	###my husband is a finance major also.###speakerb16.###speakera17.###and, uh, we kind of have the same plan.###uh, we have one credit card###and every month we put, uh, you know, the same amount in for retirement.###uh, and we budget, we're, our, our new thing to our budget is 0 we just had a baby.###so we're, budgeting, uh, each month, uh, an allowance for his education starting now.###speakerb18.###speakera19.###speakerb20.###right.###speakera21.###speakerb22.###right.###speakera23.###so that's in our budget every month now.###that's the newest addition.###but we too do the same thing as far as, uh,###we have a set amount
167872:78	i mean, in the, in those places where, uh, like the economy is really bad *t*-1, they might, you know, be more tempted *-2 to, to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the, you know, money *-3 to put food on the table and stuff like that. more than they would *?*, you know, in areas where they	might	### that, that was true for mine too.###uh, although i i'm sure 0 to some extent, that money is part of the problem in the disparity,###speakerb18.###speakera19.###but i don't think, i honestly don't think 0 that's the biggest part of it.###you know, i think that, uh, i mean i know that in my town, you know, most of the, most of the parents, they're valued education.###speakerb20.###what d-,###speakera21.### and, uh you know, and so the students were, you know, to some extent, motivated *-1 to learn.###speakerb22.###yeah,###that's true.###speakera23.###i mean you know.###speakerb24.###yeah.###and i'm also###speakera25.###speakerb26.
167885:14	now i think maybe 0 it's started *-1 changing in the past few years because, uh, they have of these, uh, sort of mandatory, --tory tests if 0 you have *-2 to take *t*-3 before you get a diploma.	maybe	###speakera23.###i mean you know.###speakerb24.###yeah.###and i'm also###speakera25.###speakerb26.###i mean, in the, in those places where, uh, like the economy is really bad *t*-1, they might, you know, be more tempted *-2 to, to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the, you know, money *-3 to put food on the table and stuff like that. more than they would *?*, you know, in areas where they###yeah,###speakera27.###yeah,###that's true.### but, but, uh, i think, i mean 0 even more than that, even, i mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able *-1 to read, you know? which it mumblex, i mean *t*-2 it sounds like, uh,###speakerb28.###uh-huh.###speakera29.###speakerb30.###yeah.###that's true.###speakera31.
167889:33	but, uh, but, uh, certainly before that, there were people that, you know, *t*-1 would graduate from high school and could barely read.	certainly	###and i'm also###speakera25.###speakerb26.###i mean, in the, in those places where, uh, like the economy is really bad *t*-1, they might, you know, be more tempted *-2 to, to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the, you know, money *-3 to put food on the table and stuff like that. more than they would *?*, you know, in areas where they###yeah,###speakera27.###yeah,###that's true.### but, but, uh, i think, i mean 0 even more than that, even, i mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able *-1 to read, you know? which it mumblex, i mean *t*-2 it sounds like, uh,###speakerb28.###uh-huh.###speakera29.###speakerb30.###yeah.###that's true.###speakera31.###now i think maybe 0 it's started *-1 changing in the past few years because, uh, they have of these, uh, sort of mandatory, --tory tests if 0 you have *-2 to take *t*-3 before you get a diploma.###speakerb32.###right.###speakera33.
167894:89	i, i, i mean i just can't even picture how that could happen. you know, except maybe to someone who *t*-1's, you know, really badly learning, uh, disabled or something *t*-2.	maybe	###speakera27.###yeah,###that's true.### but, but, uh, i think, i mean 0 even more than that, even, i mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able *-1 to read, you know? which it mumblex, i mean *t*-2 it sounds like, uh,###speakerb28.###uh-huh.###speakera29.###speakerb30.###yeah.###that's true.###speakera31.###now i think maybe 0 it's started *-1 changing in the past few years because, uh, they have of these, uh, sort of mandatory, --tory tests if 0 you have *-2 to take *t*-3 before you get a diploma.###speakerb32.###right.###speakera33.### but, uh, but, uh, certainly before that, there were people that, you know, *t*-1 would graduate from high school and could barely read.###speakerb34.###speakera35.###uh, and that's just sort of inexcusable###and you can't really,
167918:46	and i think 0 that's almost a bigger factor, than anything else probably.	probably	###but these people obviously weren't *?*.###speakerb38.###that's hard 0 for me to say *t*-1 since i didn't, i didn't really grow,###speakera39.###speakerb40.###well when i went to elementary school *t*-1 it, it wasn't in a great area###but i still, i mean, i learned * to read, started *-1 learning *-2 to read when i was in kindergarten *t*-3, you know.###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###so i guess 0 i can't really i can't say what it *exp*-2 would be like *t*-1 * to, uh, grow up in a really oppressed region.###speakera43.###yeah.###speakerb44.###speakera45.###yeah.###speakerb46.###you know, i guess 0 the whole, the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the mumblex people.###speakera47.###yeah.
167929:138	i think 0 it *exp*-2'd be interesting * to, you know, to spend a couple of days * just looking around an inner city school. uh, you know, sort, sort of maybe from elementary through, uh, high school. you know, just sort of * to get a feel for what it's like *t*-1.	maybe	###speakera43.###yeah.###speakerb44.###speakera45.###yeah.###speakerb46.###you know, i guess 0 the whole, the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the mumblex people.###speakera47.###yeah.###and i think 0 that's almost a bigger factor, than anything else probably.###speakerb48.###speakera49.###i mean, i don't, i think you know, 0 people just,###speakerb50.###so, i guess 0 the problem is 0 the, the thing 0 * to do *t*-1 is * to try *-2 to, uh, to get some kind of motivation * to learn###and,###speakera51.###yeah.###and, again, i don't, i mean###they got *-1 to know the, you know, how qualified, i mean, mumblex
168035:12	i think probably due to, uh, a lot of students going back and forth to school.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakera8.###and, uh, it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion *t*-1. and when we get, get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above *t*-2###speakerb9.###speakera10.###and it just sits and sits and sits###and we're starting *-2 to hit pollution levels *ich*-3 now on the wasatch front which *t*-1 match that of l a a few years ago.###speakerb11.###oh.###speakera12.### it's not, it's almost sad.###because when i grew up here *t*-1, it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys###and now it's not in the mountain valleys.###speakerb13.###yeah.###yeah,###i live in the, university district###speakera14.###speakerb15.###and, uh, uh, it's supposed *-1 to have about the worst air pollution.
168284:93	it's like well you know, if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink, you know, like a couple of twelve packs, maybe, over the weekend it's going *-1 to be hard pressed * to p-, *-1 to put all your recyclables in that one place, you know.	maybe	### and you know, and, and if you've got, uh, food containers or anything like that, it's a big problem.###speakerb53.###exactly.###speakera54.###speakerb55.###it is, you know, a big hassle.###speakera56.###so not only do you###speakerb57.###speakera58.###yeah.###speakerb59.###yeah,###that's true.###i mean, up here, they give you one, one of those containers###and you put everything in it.###speakera60.###uh-huh.###speakerb61.###so it's like, if, if you use a lot of stuff, you,
168296:12	that's definitely one thing 0 they could do *t*-1 *-2 to make it easier is * to just, you know.	definitely	###yeah,###that's true.###i mean, up here, they give you one, one of those containers###and you put everything in it.###speakera60.###uh-huh.###speakerb61.###so it's like, if, if you use a lot of stuff, you,###it's like well you know, if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink, you know, like a couple of twelve packs, maybe, over the weekend it's going *-1 to be hard pressed * to p-, *-1 to put all your recyclables in that one place, you know.###speakera62.###uh-huh.###speakerb63.###speakera64.###this is true.###speakerb65.###so it's kind of a pain in the butt.###speakera66.###this is true.###speakerb67.###but, uh, i don't know.
168298:64	* have them do a little bit of the sorting. you know. and, and maybe come up with a better system.	maybe	###i mean, up here, they give you one, one of those containers###and you put everything in it.###speakera60.###uh-huh.###speakerb61.###so it's like, if, if you use a lot of stuff, you,###it's like well you know, if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink, you know, like a couple of twelve packs, maybe, over the weekend it's going *-1 to be hard pressed * to p-, *-1 to put all your recyclables in that one place, you know.###speakera62.###uh-huh.###speakerb63.###speakera64.###this is true.###speakerb65.###so it's kind of a pain in the butt.###speakera66.###this is true.###speakerb67.###but, uh, i don't know.###that's definitely one thing 0 they could do *t*-1 *-2 to make it easier is * to just, you know.###you have, have those garbage people that *t*-1 make, how every many, make tw-, twenty, thirty bucks an hour,
168400:63	and, uh, our family income, at this point, is comfortable. upper middle class i guess 0 you might say 0 *t*-1.	might	###yeah.###speakera100.###and this kind of fits into the, uh, the aid program,###the welfare program that *t*-1's going on right now.###speakerb101.###uh-huh.###speakera102.###and it's like, uh,###speakera1.###your turn.###speakerb2.###oh, i, i start.###okay.###well, uh, we keep a budget to an extent.###uh, and really, i-, i-, we were really forced *-2 into *-3 keeping a budget because i'm, i'm paid once a month which *t*-1 sort of, sort of forces some, uh, uh, restrictions###and you need *-1 to make * sure 0 all your bills are paid *-2.###uh, about yourself?###speakera3.###well, i have *-1 to say 0 i really don't have a budget.###both my wife and i, uh, grew up in, uh, families of rather modest means
168543:22	but, um, uh *, maybe slowly changing my opinion.	maybe	###if he wants *-1 to use it, he has *-2 to go * get it###and that usually,###speakera1.###well, actually, uh,###speakerb2.###speakera3.### i, i don't think 0 i'm in the, uh, majority of, in, in texas###i don't think 0 i agree with,###speakerb4.###oh really.###speakera5.###no.###speakerb6.###you don't believe in it?###speakera7.###uh, i wouldn't say that.###i think 0 i would have said that a few years ago.###speakerb8.###speakera9.###when i was younger *t*-1 i thought 0 it was, uh, a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have, uh, capital punishment
168557:23	she, she probably would agree more with you	probably	###speakera7.###uh, i wouldn't say that.###i think 0 i would have said that a few years ago.###speakerb8.###speakera9.###when i was younger *t*-1 i thought 0 it was, uh, a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have, uh, capital punishment###but, um, uh *, maybe slowly changing my opinion.###speakerb10.###yeah.###speakera11.###i'm not thoroughly opposed to it.###i still think 0 it *exp*-1's sort of true that a more civilized society wouldn't have *-3 to use capital punishment###but i'm beginning *-1 to believe 0 this is less civilized society than i thought *?*.###speakerb12.###you sound a lot like a friend of mine. a a girl 0 i hang out with *t*-1.###speakera13.###uh-huh.###speakerb14.###she has very, very black and white opinions, you know.###there's no gray in her opinions, you know.
168577:8	i certainly don't, uh, advocate * turning people like that loose.	certainly	### she, she probably would agree more with you### but, but i don't know.###i think 0 i would rather *ich*-2 0 a person go ahead and be put *-1 down than * give them the opportunity * to get out and do it again.###i've never had a, a punishment or a, a crime like a murder touch my immediate family###speakera15.###uh-huh.###speakerb16.###but i still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way 0 * to, to punish *t*-1, especially criminals who *t*-2 seem *-3 to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done *t*-4.###speakera17.###yeah.###speakerb18.###and we see that more and more.###like in our state right now, there's a fourteen year old boy who *t*-1 raped and then killed a seven year old girl###speakera19.###uh-huh.###speakerb20.###you know, that's fourteen years old.###what's he going *-1 to be doing *t*-2 when he turns into an adult *t*-3.###speakera21.###yeah.
168626:12	the european countries certainly, uh, none of them have capital punishment	certainly	###and we'd get along just fine.###speakera31.###uh-huh.###speakerb32.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###but when i've got *-1 to work *-2 to pay my dues and your dues *t*-3 then i don't like you very much anymore.###speakera35.###yeah.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###yeah.###well, i,###the cost is something###but it's, but i think 0 it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of, * dealing with crime *t*-1###speakerb38.###speakera39.###and i guess 0 i would like,###i don't know,
168643:8	you might be right.	might	###speakera39.###and i guess 0 i would like,###i don't know,###the european countries certainly, uh, none of them have capital punishment###and they they don't have a crime problem either.###speakerb40.###oh, really.###speakera41.###no,###you can't,###they don't execute anybody in britain or france###and i don't believe 0 they do in germany or italy either###and they don't have the crime problems 0 we do *t*-1.###i don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two.###speakerb42.###yeah.###speakera43.###i guess 0 what *t*-1 worries me about capital punishment is, uh, 0 when i see people enthusiastic about it and, uh, uh, sort of bloodthirsty *t*-2. i think 0 it brings out the worst in the, in the people who *t*-3 do the punishing###and the, that, that bothers me.###speakerb44.
168687:49	what what's *t*-1 making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of * punishing?	might	###well actually i, wha-,###the other thing that *t*-1 bothers me is when it becomes a political issue *t*-2 because i don't really think 0 it, uh, i don't really think 0 it's a very important aspect of * fighting crime or law and order or anything else.###i think 0 it just becomes a, uh, symbolic i'm tougher than you are *?* type of emotional issue for politicians###so###speakerb56.###yeah.###speakera57.###i would like for it to be settled once for all and, uh, get in the background while the more important issues get discussed *-1, uh, uh,###speakerb58.###right.###speakera59.###like i said, some years ago, i think 0 i would have said 0 there's no place for capital punishment in the, civilized western country.###speakerb60.###speakera61.###speakerb62.###uh-huh.###speakera63.###now i'm, i'm not so sure of that.### i'm, i, i wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around.###speakerb64.
168721:27	that ki-, the kids maybe on the average get, uh, something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents.	maybe	###and, uh, i've also never been a victim although i have some, i have two friends whose wives *t*-1 were murdered *-2###and, uh i can imagine that, uh, uh, for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case.###speakerb72.###oh, gosh.###speakera73.###speakerb74.###oh yes,###if it ever touched my fam-,###speakera1.###i, you know,###actually in this modern day and age, it seems like, uh, uh, we have more and more leisure time because, uh, we have so many convenience, appliances and whatnot.###we don't even have *-1 to cook dinner anymore.###speakerb2.###yes.###yeah,###really.###speakera3.###uh, but i, uh, i've heard, i don't know this for a fact, but i've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together.###speakerb4.###speakera5.
168727:34	i don't quite understand it, although i think probably 0 the, the worst thing that *t*-1's happening in the world, at least the modern world today, is television.	probably	###oh yes,###if it ever touched my fam-,###speakera1.###i, you know,###actually in this modern day and age, it seems like, uh, uh, we have more and more leisure time because, uh, we have so many convenience, appliances and whatnot.###we don't even have *-1 to cook dinner anymore.###speakerb2.###yes.###yeah,###really.###speakera3.###uh, but i, uh, i've heard, i don't know this for a fact, but i've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together.###speakerb4.###speakera5.### that ki-, the kids maybe on the average get, uh, something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents.###speakerb6.###that's what i've heard *t*-1 too.###uh,###speakera7.###it seems bizarre to me.
168867:13	oh, i probably spend an hour or two.	probably	###speakerb54.###well, yeah### i like * to, i like *-1 to do it###and they enjoy reading.###i've, actually i never read a lot *-2 growing up###and i never read until a few years ago###i just started *-1 picking up books###and so i've found that, you know, it *exp*-1's really important to me * to get *-2 to read.###* to, i like *-1 to get away in a book, you know?###speakera55.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakerb56.###and so i've put a lot more emphasis on that, on my kids * to try and,###speakera57.###uh-huh.###so how much time do you think 0 you spend *t*-1 with your kids on the average per each day?###speakerb58.###speakera59.###speakerb60.
169039:33	i, i think 0 that might be talking, referring to, uh, something, kind of, uh, alternative to the draft, you know.	might	###speakera6.###uh, i know that f-, because my son is a, a scout now and, uh, is thinking about his eagle###and, uh, in order * to get eagle, you have *-1 to have merit badges in, uh, citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation, citizenship in the world###speakerb7.###right.###speakera8.###and you have *-1 to do a public service project. uh, in which leadership is the key element *t*-2.###speakerb9.###uh-huh.###speakera10.### i, uh, i think 0 the question is posed *-1 somewhat strangely because, uh, it's talking about a requirement for public service###speakerb11.###uh-huh.###speakera12.###and, of course, pe-, the peace corps, the boy scouts is a, o-, is a voluntary activity.###speakerb13.###right.###speakera14.###uh,###speakerb15.
169056:8	that probably is not what *t*-1 was comprehended *-2.	probably	###speakera14.###uh,###speakerb15.### i, i think 0 that might be talking, referring to, uh, something, kind of, uh, alternative to the draft, you know.###either you have, uh, military service or some sort of alternative, nonmilitary service for a few years.###speakera16.###right,###of course, uh, uh, military service falls under the category, uh, of a public service.###speakerb17.###right,###right.###speakera18.###and, so, uh, one of the things that *t*-1 would fulfill the, at least the nominal, uh, qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft.###speakerb19.###huh.###right,###right.###speakera20.###uh,###but i agree with you,
169125:47	and it was, uh, you know, it was definitely a projection of u s power on the other side of the globe,	definitely	###and the whole point of the military is * to kill people *ich*-1 essentially. as, as an instrument of u s policy.###speakera38.###oh, no,###no,###no.###it's * to defend the nation against external evils.###speakerb39.###well, that's one view.### and, and, you know, and that, that's another debate.###but, uh, it's, uh,###speakera40.###well, it depends on whether you, whether we figure that we have that we have a defense oriented military or an aggressive, aggression oriented military.###speakerb41.###uh-huh.###speakera42.###speakerb43.###right,###right###and, well, it's, it, it seems pretty aggre-, aggressive oriented,###i mean, you, you look at the last mis-, military action which *t*-1 was in the persian gulf and wasn't anywhere near the united states
169459:74	if you were deeply involved in it, then you immediately realize that what they print *t*-1 is stuff that you probably knew *t*-5 already and the stuff that you want *t*-2 they're not printing *t*-4 because the average person doesn't need or want *-3 to know that much.	probably	###and, uh, i guess 0 you could explain it two ways.### and, and the cynical view is, well these things aren't doing a very good job at all.###and the view that i would rather take *t*-1 is that there's a different amount of information 0 you need *t*-2 when you're particularly interested in a topic or, uh, particularly interested in *-7 buying something as a, you know as a hobbyist *t*-5 versus when you want *-3 to go out and buy a blender because you need *-4 to mix things *t*-6.###speakera23.###uh-huh.###speakerb24.###speakera25.###right.###speakerb26.###speakera27.###yeah.###speakerb28.###and i think 0 the same thing is true with news.###if you want *-1 to just have an idea as to what *t*-2's going on, most papers, a-, and especially the better papers, the, the times, the wall street journal, the washington post give you a reasonable idea.###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb30.###speakera31.###yeah.###speakerb32.
169548:5	probably the best things 0 * to do *t*-1 is, is * tie them with a rope and throw them in the water	probably	###speakerb58.###i decided 0 i didn't want *-1 to waste the time###i had, i guess, five years ago now, wasted that kind of time with oliver north hearings. and afterwards, decided that what i had gotten *t*-1 out of it just wasn't worth the time 0 i put *t*-2 in. and that these things are just very slow in * seeing information come out.###speakera59.###right,###right.###yeah.###speakerb60.###speakera61.###uh-huh.###speakerb62.###speakera63.###yeah.###speakerb64.###speakera65.###do you ever read,###speakera1.###okay.###speakerb2.###i say 0 they, uh,
169578:38	and i, i think 0 that's probably all right in that they, you know, maybe know what the, the norm *ich*-2 is *t*-1 for a particular thing.	probably	### th-, that's, of course, * being facetious###but.###speakera7.###uh-huh.###you'd have *-1 to say that.###speakerb8.###speakera9.###uh, i don't know.### the, the things 0 they asked *-3 to talk about *t*-1 were whether the, uh, whether the judge should be the one that *t*-2 does the, uh, sentencing.###speakerb10.###uh-huh.###speakera11.###and * seems to me that that's, i think 0 that's the way 0 it's done *-1 now *t*-2.###uh, at least, my understanding of the law which *t*-1 isn't very good.###speakerb12.###speakera13.###speakerb14.###uh-huh.###speakera15.###uh, it seems to me that the judge does it
169578:67	and i, i think 0 that's probably all right in that they, you know, maybe know what the, the norm *ich*-2 is *t*-1 for a particular thing.	maybe	### th-, that's, of course, * being facetious###but.###speakera7.###uh-huh.###you'd have *-1 to say that.###speakerb8.###speakera9.###uh, i don't know.### the, the things 0 they asked *-3 to talk about *t*-1 were whether the, uh, whether the judge should be the one that *t*-2 does the, uh, sentencing.###speakerb10.###uh-huh.###speakera11.###and * seems to me that that's, i think 0 that's the way 0 it's done *-1 now *t*-2.###uh, at least, my understanding of the law which *t*-1 isn't very good.###speakerb12.###speakera13.###speakerb14.###uh-huh.###speakera15.###uh, it seems to me that the judge does it
169588:30	possibly though on, uh, capital cases like maybe the death penalty	maybe	###uh-huh.###speakera11.###and * seems to me that that's, i think 0 that's the way 0 it's done *-1 now *t*-2.###uh, at least, my understanding of the law which *t*-1 isn't very good.###speakerb12.###speakera13.###speakerb14.###uh-huh.###speakera15.###uh, it seems to me that the judge does it###and i, i think 0 that's probably all right in that they, you know, maybe know what the, the norm *ich*-2 is *t*-1 for a particular thing.###speakerb16.###uh-huh.###speakera17.###speakerb18.###and, i guess, also what the system will absorb *t*-1.###speakera19.###right.###speakerb20.###probably more tuned in to that.
169598:7	but maybe, uh,	maybe	###and i, i think 0 that's probably all right in that they, you know, maybe know what the, the norm *ich*-2 is *t*-1 for a particular thing.###speakerb16.###uh-huh.###speakera17.###speakerb18.###and, i guess, also what the system will absorb *t*-1.###speakera19.###right.###speakerb20.###probably more tuned in to that.###possibly though on, uh, capital cases like maybe the death penalty###speakera21.###uh-huh.###speakerb22.###uh, i'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole,###i mean he could have like a personal prejudice.###you know, judges are people like everybody else even though they're, they're supposed *-1 to be impartial###speakera23.###that's right.###speakerb24.
169681:8	well maybe not.	maybe	###yeah.###i think 0 this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years.###speakerb50.###uh-huh.###yeah,###that,###speakera51.###but i guess 0 there have been several cases where people have been executed *-1 by mistake *t*-2###and you'd hate *-1 to be one of those.###speakerb52.###yeah.###oh, i'm sure.###speakera53.###speakerb54.###yeah.###speakera55.###the other thing 0 they asked about *t*-1 was whether uh, uh, the verdict should be required *-2 to be unanimous. which, again, i think 0 *t*-3 is the way 0 it is *t*-5 now. that all the, all verdicts,###speakerb56.###uh-huh.###speakera57.
169716:26	that, that's probably an expensive trial.	probably	###yeah.###the paper here tonight had a thing about the noriega trial. and that there's one juror that *t*-1 is, is, uh, different than the other eleven.###speakerb64.###uh-huh.###speakera65.###speakerb66.###yeah.###speakera67.###and, uh, they've only deliberated four hours or, something###speakerb68.###speakera69.###and they say 0 they're hopelessly deadlocked.###speakerb70.###oh, no.###speakera71.###and the judge told them, 0 they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet.###speakerb72.###speakera73.###speakerb74.###i'm telling you, * go one way or the other.
169730:11	it's probably like thirty, forty thousand dollars a day you know, worth of all the free for all.	probably	###speakera71.###and the judge told them, 0 they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet.###speakerb72.###speakera73.###speakerb74.###i'm telling you, * go one way or the other.### that, that's probably an expensive trial.###uh,###speakera75.###yeah.###six months so far they said *t*-1.###speakerb76.###yeah.###probably.###speakera77.###so.###speakerb78.###yeah.###probably.###you know, i'm not sure 0 there's a number.
169898:50	you know, so as a patient, i feel 0 well, yeah, we probably should be protected *-1.	probably	###speakerb30.###i mean, ye-,###speakera31.###the only way 0 i can see it *t*-1 is that if they really suspect a person of *-2 using it, then they have the right *-3 to go ahead and prove it###because they say 0 they can spot check.###speakerb32.###if you're using it while *-1 at a job, i can see a problem.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###but the occasional person, then it's almost like, it's almost an infringement of your privacy.###speakera35.###well, it sort of is *?*.###and this is it,###this,###i'm not real sure how i feel *t*-1 about it because i can see it from two ways.###you know, as a health professional, i wouldn't want somebody *ich*-1 to take care of me that *t*-2 was using drugs.###speakerb36.###yeah.###speakera37.
169922:7	but maybe you shouldn't be held *-1 responsible for something 0 you did *t*-2 several years ago.	maybe	###yeah.###speakera39.###you can't go around *-1 testing everybody for everything.###speakerb40.###yeah.###speakera41.###so, i don't know.###and i, i think 0 it could be used *-1 *-2 to hassle somebody.###if someone was out *-1 to get you, i think that a company or a boss could use this.###you know, they could keep on *-1 doing this to you or something, i guess 0 *t*-2.###i can see where it could become a problem *t*-1.###speakerb42.###and it, it's like, it seems like now they have tests###i guess 0 they can test your hair###and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago.###speakera43.###really.###speakerb44.###speakera45.###oh, wow!
169945:10	so that probably wouldn't be too good either.	probably	###speakera47.###speakerb48.###i know.###speakera49.###that's the other thing.###i mean a lot of, a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of *t*-1 later on###and i don't think 0 they should really have *-1 to pay for that forever.###speakerb50.###yeah.###there's a lot of things 0 you do *t*-1 as a kid that you wouldn't do *t*-2 as an adult###speakera51.###yeah.###speakerb52.###but you can't say 0 it was wrong at the time.###speakera53.###i think 0 that's true.###speakerb54.###speakera55.###yeah,###yeah.
169955:171	but if you had, if you had, uh, parents say or, or, or th-, grandparents, whatever it is *t*-1, uh, who *t*-2 were ready, who, who you thought 0 *t*-3 might benefit from a nursing home, what do you think 0 you would look for *t*-4?	might	###speakera51.###yeah.###speakerb52.###but you can't say 0 it was wrong at the time.###speakera53.###i think 0 that's true.###speakerb54.###speakera55.###yeah,###yeah.###so that probably wouldn't be too good either.###speakerb1.###bye.###so we're, uh, our discussion's about, uh, the care of the elderly?###speakera2.###that's right,###that's right.###you know, what, what, uh, what do you think 0 *t*-1 is important?###if you were,###uh, i don't know how, how old you are *t*-1,
170007:181	but again, um, it must be depressing for the people who, who *t*-1 are, who *t*-2 are just e-, e-, essentially not able *-3 to take care of themselves in their own house but, but, certainly, uh, certainly have ar-, ar-, are, have retained all of their, uh, mental skills and so on.	certainly	###uh-huh.###speakera18.###and it seems, uh,###i mean the, the environment there, i don't know too much about it###but it, it seems nice enough.###uh, it, it's hard,###at least half of the residents i would say 0 *t*-1 are not, not mentally sound.###so it *exp*-2's hard * to tell how much of that *t*-3 rubs off on those who *t*-1 are struggling *-4 to r-, to retain, uh, clarity, say, uh, you know.###speakerb19.###from the lack of stimulation, you mean *t*-1.###speakera20.###yeah.###well i, i don-, i don't know.### we, we *ich*-3 also, my wife and i, uh, uh, volunteer *-1 to go to a, uh, nursing home that *t*-2's just a mile from our house.### we, uh, she goes more often than i.###we used *-1 to go once a month, once every two months *-2 to visit some of the patients there.###and we'd take, we have a two year old son###and so we, sometimes we'd take him with us.###and, uh, there i would say 0 it's the same thing.### it's, it's a nice, uh, relatively nice environment
170007:194	but again, um, it must be depressing for the people who, who *t*-1 are, who *t*-2 are just e-, e-, essentially not able *-3 to take care of themselves in their own house but, but, certainly, uh, certainly have ar-, ar-, are, have retained all of their, uh, mental skills and so on.	certainly	###uh-huh.###speakera18.###and it seems, uh,###i mean the, the environment there, i don't know too much about it###but it, it seems nice enough.###uh, it, it's hard,###at least half of the residents i would say 0 *t*-1 are not, not mentally sound.###so it *exp*-2's hard * to tell how much of that *t*-3 rubs off on those who *t*-1 are struggling *-4 to r-, to retain, uh, clarity, say, uh, you know.###speakerb19.###from the lack of stimulation, you mean *t*-1.###speakera20.###yeah.###well i, i don-, i don't know.### we, we *ich*-3 also, my wife and i, uh, uh, volunteer *-1 to go to a, uh, nursing home that *t*-2's just a mile from our house.### we, uh, she goes more often than i.###we used *-1 to go once a month, once every two months *-2 to visit some of the patients there.###and we'd take, we have a two year old son###and so we, sometimes we'd take him with us.###and, uh, there i would say 0 it's the same thing.### it's, it's a nice, uh, relatively nice environment
170023:26	and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person's needs is really because this person is just, you know, is just in a state where they don't really need what they think 0 they need *t*-1 *t*-2, you know.	maybe	###and we'd take, we have a two year old son###and so we, sometimes we'd take him with us.###and, uh, there i would say 0 it's the same thing.### it's, it's a nice, uh, relatively nice environment###but again, um, it must be depressing for the people who, who *t*-1 are, who *t*-2 are just e-, e-, essentially not able *-3 to take care of themselves in their own house but, but, certainly, uh, certainly have ar-, ar-, are, have retained all of their, uh, mental skills and so on.###it *ich*-2's, must be depressing * to, to walk, walk the halls and see, an-, and see all these other people who *t*-3 really don't know where they are *t*-1.###speakerb21.###do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with *t*-1, that the people who *t*-2 operate it seem *-3 to have, what you'd perceive of *t*-4 as genuine concern?###speakera22.###i think, yeah,###i think 0 they're relatively re-, respectful. yeah and, and concerned that, in as much as they can be *?*.### i, i think sometimes, you know, i've noticed, uh, people asking for, uh, some of the patients asking for things *ich*-1, uh, just repetitively and, but things that *t*-2 are not reasonable,###speakerb23.###uh-huh.###speakera24.###and so at some level the, the, the, uh,###speakerb25.###yeah.###speakera26.###i'm sure that the, that the, uh, the staff l-, learn what *t*-1's normal for this person
170052:17	there's nothing, maybe a picture or two that *t*-1 belongs to that person	maybe	###yeah.###i'll tell you one thing *ich*-3 *ich*-2 though that *t*-5'll, that, that i, i saw *t*-4 that *t*-1 was really nice.###we saw a husband and wife,###we used *-1 to see a husband and wife in there, uh, together###and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were *t*-1###but these two were *?*.###speakerb31.###uh-huh.###speakera32.###and when you walked into their room *t*-1, they had brought all their furniture from their house###speakerb33.###uh-huh.###so it gives them a sense of identity.###speakera34.###and so,###speakerb35.###speakera36.###yeah,###you walked in there###and it didn't look like, uh, you know, how, yo-, you, you walk into some rooms *t*-1 and there's, it's completely generic.
170114:12	uh, so maybe we should start with you.	maybe	###yes.###yeah.###well i-, i, i, i feel like, uh, i am from mars.###i mean i'm fifty years old###and, uh, i've been divorced for, um, eighteen years.###but i've two kids and all.###but i, uh, i, i've never had a budget###and i don't, uh, do any planning###and i don't know,###speakerb4.###speakera5.###mumblex i don't, uh, uh, i don't have a long-term financial plan.###i don't try *-1 to control my expenses.###speakerb6.###speakera7.###but i'm, i'm glad 0 you're a stranger.###speakerb8.###that sounds kind of like me.###speakera9.###but, really, i'm, i happy, i, i, well i'm curious how other people live *t*-1.
170186:8	i certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever.	certainly	### i, well i didn't keep a balance.###it's one of the problems.###speakerb28.###speakera29.###i never had *-1 to *?* in the past.###speakerb30.###speakera31.###i always kept plenty of money in my checking account,###but when you're only earning half the salary *t*-1. even though i wasn't spending much money, i sometimes i sometimes would just,###things would get to tight.###uh, and sometimes what i would do *t*-1 is * keep a piece of paper in my wallet###and every time 0 i, uh, i spent money, i mean cash mostly *t*-1, i would, uh, write it down so i could see at the end of a month how much i spent *t*-2 on food so i could do better planning.###speakerb32.###uh-huh.###speakera33.###speakerb34.###uh-huh.###speakera35.###but i would forget *-1 to write the things down###and it, that i, i don't know if i ever went as far as three months *ich*-1 or not i-, i-, in *-2 keeping that kind of data.
170214:39	someday, if i were *-1 to get remarried *-2 i might want *-3 to buy a house which *t*-4 requires lots of money which i don't have *t*-5	might	###uh-huh.###speakerb40.###and, uh,###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###so i, i, i leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account###and i figure that, so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what *t*-1's really there.###speakera43.###uh-huh.###speakerb44.###and i figure 0 that gives me room for the mistakes 0 i make *t*-1.###speakera45.###uh-huh.###the, uh,### i, i-, i have *-1 to say that,###* let's see,###at this point on, i don't run out of money.###uh, and it, uh,### a-, and i don't, i mean
170242:65	but for me, i only do that every week or, without even, i mean, maybe once a month.	maybe	###yeah.###speakera47.### pe-, people were embarrassed for me.###i mean it was, it was a good car###and,###speakerb48.###but it was still running.###speakera49.###oh, it was great.### my, my mechanics loved it because it was an old, it was a sixty-five buick###and it just wouldn't stop.###uh, and it,### i, i just didn't feel the need for a new car.###it isn't like i couldn't afford one.###speakerb50.###uh-huh.###speakera51.###uh, and now, i mean i, i don't, uh,###i tend *-1 to eat expensive food.###i mean i don't mind *-1 buying a good steak
170280:55	the area 0 i work in *t*-1, it, it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so.	maybe	### so, so that's, i think 0 *t*-4, one of the reasons 0 i don't need *-1 to budget *t*-2 is that i don't have, i don't, i don't have *-3 to hold myself back from *-5 buying that expensive thing because i can't afford it, because i'm not interested in that expensive thing.###speakerb60.###a lot of,###speakera1.### wha-, what sort of company do you work for *t*-1?###do you work for a big *rnr*-1 or a little *rnr*-1 place?###speakerb2.###uh, i work for georgia tech.###yes sir.###i work for the research facility.###uh, and it's, it's kind of small in a sense###but it, it does have, about, uh, i guess, two thousand civil employees.###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.###and, on a, a scale, i guess 0 it's still considered *-1 small.###it just have a lot of different laboratories.###speakera5.###uh-huh.###speakerb6.
170292:48	well, i, i work for, uh, *ich*-1 actually probably similar kind of place.	probably	###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.###and, on a, a scale, i guess 0 it's still considered *-1 small.###it just have a lot of different laboratories.###speakera5.###uh-huh.###speakerb6.###the area 0 i work in *t*-1, it, it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so.###speakera7.###uh-huh.###speakerb8.###so that's make up most of the laboratory###so from, from that standpoint, it's pretty small it's pretty small.###speakera9.###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###what about yourself?###speakera11.###huh.
170312:257	uh, while i was sitting here *-1 waiting while they tried *-2 to find somebody 0 for me to talk to *t*-3, *-1 trying *-8 to think of what, uh, uh, what things *ich*-5 *t*-4 were important, uh, besides salary and a, and a job. i guess, uh, mumblex list 0 i had scribbled *t*-6 down was the people 0 you worked with *t*-7 and maybe the, uh, the challenge of the work and, uh the working conditions, things like that.	maybe	###well, i, i work for, uh, *ich*-1 actually probably similar kind of place.###i work for, uh, lincoln laboratory.###speakerb12.###oh, okay.###speakera13.###uh, yeah.###we actually do some work with some people down at georgia tech.###speakerb14.###oh, okay.###i see.###speakera15.###uh, and, uh,###so we're, we're part, we're actually part of m i t.###so it's very much the same kind of place and, uh the technical institution.###speakerb16.###oh, okay.###speakera17.###speakerb18.###right. uh,###speakera19.
170322:15	well those and probably the security aspect of it.	probably	###speakera15.###uh, and, uh,###so we're, we're part, we're actually part of m i t.###so it's very much the same kind of place and, uh the technical institution.###speakerb16.###oh, okay.###speakera17.###speakerb18.###right. uh,###speakera19.###uh, while i was sitting here *-1 waiting while they tried *-2 to find somebody 0 for me to talk to *t*-3, *-1 trying *-8 to think of what, uh, uh, what things *ich*-5 *t*-4 were important, uh, besides salary and a, and a job. i guess, uh, mumblex list 0 i had scribbled *t*-6 down was the people 0 you worked with *t*-7 and maybe the, uh, the challenge of the work and, uh the working conditions, things like that.###speakerb20.###uh-huh.###speakera21.###speakerb22.###right.###speakera23.###i don't know.### what are your, uh, what sorts of things would you consider *t*-1 important?###speakerb24.
170360:35	i don't see how one or two people, maybe more one or two, but, you know, a number of people can, can be the downfall of com-, a company situation *t*-1.	maybe	###speakera31.###uh-huh.###speakerb32.###that way that, you know, one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time.###speakera33.###uh-huh.###speakerb34.###and, uh, you know, i think 0 if they had programs that *t*-1 set up *-2 to subsidize people that *t*-3 do get laid *-4 off a little bit better, you know, other than s-, you know, something like,###unemployment is good###but i mean the company as a whole###because you as an employee,###even the company is making money,###they paying you a salary###but you are responsible for that company growth.###you're responsible *ich*-1 also for *-3 helping that company get to the par-, point that it's at *t*-2 at *-4 making profits.###so there should be something *ich*-2 in there or some kind of clause that *t*-1 will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than, you know, uh, neglect or something like that.###speakera35.###uh-huh.###speakerb36.###you know. because it *exp*-1's not a person's fault that, you know, people not buying or businesses are, are not on the up and up all the time, you know.
170517:7	and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that.	maybe	### we, we really did not.###my next oldest daughter that *t*-1's in college in california is a world twirling champion.###she twirls a baton###and we did a lot of things together.###speakerb31.###uh-huh.###speakera32.###she and i did a lot of things together and flew,###we have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform.###speakerb33.###uh-huh.###speakera34.###and that was a lot of fun.###but that, that, i guess 0 you could consider that organized.###i mean, there is a competition all the time.###speakerb35.###yeah.###speakera36.###we were very heavy into that.###other than that, they were pretty much,
170519:31	you know, i think 0 that's probably true.	probably	###she twirls a baton###and we did a lot of things together.###speakerb31.###uh-huh.###speakera32.###she and i did a lot of things together and flew,###we have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform.###speakerb33.###uh-huh.###speakera34.###and that was a lot of fun.###but that, that, i guess 0 you could consider that organized.###i mean, there is a competition all the time.###speakerb35.###yeah.###speakera36.###we were very heavy into that.###other than that, they were pretty much,###and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that.###speakerb37.
170576:60	i think 0 a, a, more than one child, probably three children is probably the ideal to me	probably	###speakerb49.###uh-huh.###speakera50.###so the three of us just spent a lot of time *-1 traveling and, and competing###and, of course, the competing itself, really * *exp*-1 didn't matter what it was *t*-2,###it was * making the friends and going all the places###and it was a really neat experience,###but it took our total time.###i did not work, uh, when i did this *t*-1.###now i do work full-time.###speakerb51.###uh-huh.###speakera52.###and it's just, my thirteen year old and myself###speakerb53.###speakera54.###and so we really have *-1 to keep it together *-2 to get just her activities in and still have time 0 *-4 to spend *t*-3 with each other.###so,###speakerb55.###i don't think, although i-, i-,
170576:71	i think 0 a, a, more than one child, probably three children is probably the ideal to me	probably	###speakerb49.###uh-huh.###speakera50.###so the three of us just spent a lot of time *-1 traveling and, and competing###and, of course, the competing itself, really * *exp*-1 didn't matter what it was *t*-2,###it was * making the friends and going all the places###and it was a really neat experience,###but it took our total time.###i did not work, uh, when i did this *t*-1.###now i do work full-time.###speakerb51.###uh-huh.###speakera52.###and it's just, my thirteen year old and myself###speakerb53.###speakera54.###and so we really have *-1 to keep it together *-2 to get just her activities in and still have time 0 *-4 to spend *t*-3 with each other.###so,###speakerb55.###i don't think, although i-, i-,
170578:10	i most certainly couldn't educate three.	certainly	###speakera50.###so the three of us just spent a lot of time *-1 traveling and, and competing###and, of course, the competing itself, really * *exp*-1 didn't matter what it was *t*-2,###it was * making the friends and going all the places###and it was a really neat experience,###but it took our total time.###i did not work, uh, when i did this *t*-1.###now i do work full-time.###speakerb51.###uh-huh.###speakera52.###and it's just, my thirteen year old and myself###speakerb53.###speakera54.###and so we really have *-1 to keep it together *-2 to get just her activities in and still have time 0 *-4 to spend *t*-3 with each other.###so,###speakerb55.###i don't think, although i-, i-,###i think 0 a, a, more than one child, probably three children is probably the ideal to me###but i'm not sure 0 i could afford three.
170761:17	uh, more than likely.	likely	###but, uh, you know, i hate *-1 to go into a, a repair place because they'll tell me 0 something is wrong with it and it's not *?*, you know, and *-2 charge me twice as much.###the last time 0 i took it into a repair shop *t*-1, the man told me 0 i needed a master cylinder.###so i said okay.###and he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars###and then, uh, about a month later, a man was looking at my car###and he asked me, you know,### not a man, not a repair man, but just a friend###and i was telling him that i just a new master cylinder put *-1 on###and he looked at###and he said that's not a new master cylinder###speakera35.###huh.###speakerb36.###and i didn't even know what one was *t*-1.###and, uh, he showed it to me###and it was old, rusty, just awful.###it was no more new than nothing.###speakera37.###so apparently it was the same one that *t*-1 was on there.###speakerb38.
170763:53	* apparently just, uh, re-, re-, uh, probably filled the, the brake fluid up	probably	###so i said okay.###and he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars###and then, uh, about a month later, a man was looking at my car###and he asked me, you know,### not a man, not a repair man, but just a friend###and i was telling him that i just a new master cylinder put *-1 on###and he looked at###and he said that's not a new master cylinder###speakera35.###huh.###speakerb36.###and i didn't even know what one was *t*-1.###and, uh, he showed it to me###and it was old, rusty, just awful.###it was no more new than nothing.###speakera37.###so apparently it was the same one that *t*-1 was on there.###speakerb38.###uh, more than likely.###speakera39.
170766:16	that was it, probably.	probably	###and he asked me, you know,### not a man, not a repair man, but just a friend###and i was telling him that i just a new master cylinder put *-1 on###and he looked at###and he said that's not a new master cylinder###speakera35.###huh.###speakerb36.###and i didn't even know what one was *t*-1.###and, uh, he showed it to me###and it was old, rusty, just awful.###it was no more new than nothing.###speakera37.###so apparently it was the same one that *t*-1 was on there.###speakerb38.###uh, more than likely.###speakera39.###* apparently just, uh, re-, re-, uh, probably filled the, the brake fluid up###and that was it.###speakerb40.
170872:23	well a lot of it's probably *-1 to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help.	probably	###they wanted some place 0 they can go and have their meals *t*-1 and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her###but they wanted *-1 to be independent as well. have their own room.###speakera13.###right.###speakerb14.###speakera15.###my grandmother actually was in a, a nursing home that, uh,###there was a retirement hotel and then a, uh,###there was some sort of full-time care place that *t*-1 was also associated *-2 with it###so for, uh, the first few years she had her own apartment and, you know, made her own meals sometimes. but could, could also go and eat someplace else.###speakerb16.###uh-huh.###speakera17.###and then, uh, as she became less able *-1 to take care of herself, then she moved into this other part that *t*-2 was able *-3 to, uh, provide full-time care###and, uh, she didn't have *-1 to do anything anymore.###but my experience has been that most people that *t*-1 move into nursing homes die very quickly.###and that's som-,###i don't know whether that's because they, you know, sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the, the reason is *t*-1.###but i think 0 the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home *t*-1 is only like six months or something.###speakerb18.
170881:11	that's probably a large factor.	probably	###so for, uh, the first few years she had her own apartment and, you know, made her own meals sometimes. but could, could also go and eat someplace else.###speakerb16.###uh-huh.###speakera17.###and then, uh, as she became less able *-1 to take care of herself, then she moved into this other part that *t*-2 was able *-3 to, uh, provide full-time care###and, uh, she didn't have *-1 to do anything anymore.###but my experience has been that most people that *t*-1 move into nursing homes die very quickly.###and that's som-,###i don't know whether that's because they, you know, sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the, the reason is *t*-1.###but i think 0 the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home *t*-1 is only like six months or something.###speakerb18.###well a lot of it's probably *-1 to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help.###speakera19.###yeah.###speakerb20.###they need health care###so they're already ill before they go.###speakera21.###right.###speakerb22.
170938:15	and you probably, if it were you, you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place 0 for you to live *t*-1 based on lowest price.	probably	###speakerb36.###yeah.###speakera37.###speakerb38.###and the money *ich*-3 is also another issue. how you're going *-1 to pay for it *t*-2.###speakera39.###right.###speakerb40.###at that stage of life you only have so much money left *###and i guess 0 it *exp*-1's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have *-3 to put it in their savings.###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###i mean it is kind of fair,###but it's also not fair because they have their own children 0 * to raise *t*-1.###speakera43.###sure.###speakerb44.###so it's another problem.###speakera45.
170938:41	and you probably, if it were you, you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place 0 for you to live *t*-1 based on lowest price.	probably	###speakerb36.###yeah.###speakera37.###speakerb38.###and the money *ich*-3 is also another issue. how you're going *-1 to pay for it *t*-2.###speakera39.###right.###speakerb40.###at that stage of life you only have so much money left *###and i guess 0 it *exp*-1's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have *-3 to put it in their savings.###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###i mean it is kind of fair,###but it's also not fair because they have their own children 0 * to raise *t*-1.###speakera43.###sure.###speakerb44.###so it's another problem.###speakera45.
170948:8	well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is * to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth * continuing *t*-1.	maybe	###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###i mean it is kind of fair,###but it's also not fair because they have their own children 0 * to raise *t*-1.###speakera43.###sure.###speakerb44.###so it's another problem.###speakera45.###and you probably, if it were you, you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place 0 for you to live *t*-1 based on lowest price.###speakerb46.###right,###right.###so, it, it's just so complicated anymore, i think 0 *t*-2.###people outlive their savings.###and, with medicine being the way 0 it is *t*-1, you're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down *t*-2###and they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore.###speakera47.###yeah.
171007:85	i suppose, uh, 0 if you're, if there is a psychology department or an education department around, you might find you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another,	might	###speakerb8.###uh-huh.###speakera9.###but, uh, when i was when my kids were young *t*-1, i was teaching at a university###and, uh, the child care center associated * with our university was quite good###so i felt confident that they'd do right.###speakerb10.###uh-huh.###speakera11.###speakerb12.###of,### aren't don't they kind of use them for, everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs? for their per-, for their pet theories or some such thing?###speakera13.###oh, you mean, uh, learning type,###uh, yeah?###i mean actual experiments they would have *-1 to get your permission.###speakerb14.###yes.###speakera15.###but, yeah,
171007:97	i suppose, uh, 0 if you're, if there is a psychology department or an education department around, you might find you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another,	might	###speakerb8.###uh-huh.###speakera9.###but, uh, when i was when my kids were young *t*-1, i was teaching at a university###and, uh, the child care center associated * with our university was quite good###so i felt confident that they'd do right.###speakerb10.###uh-huh.###speakera11.###speakerb12.###of,### aren't don't they kind of use them for, everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs? for their per-, for their pet theories or some such thing?###speakera13.###oh, you mean, uh, learning type,###uh, yeah?###i mean actual experiments they would have *-1 to get your permission.###speakerb14.###yes.###speakera15.###but, yeah,
171247:11	you're probably right.	probably	###speakera37.###and i think 0 that's ju-,###of course a part of it is technology.###i mean our kids, where would they be *t*-1 without nintendo and, you know, their t v shows###and no-,###some of that is really bad i think 0 *t*-1.###but, we have all single families.###so many single families now.###uh, a lot of working,###both parents are working.###so there's a whole big effect on our kids###and not very many of my daughter's friends really are on their original mother and father.###you know, i'm wondering what this is going *-1 to do *t*-2 in ten and twenty years.###speakerb38.###well, there's that###and there's the fact that, you know, nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding *-1 to have kids which *t*-2 generally tends *-3 to happen.###i mean the u s would be actually declining in population slightly if it weren't for the fact that we, have continuation, large scale immigration into the country.###speakera39.###speakerb40.###speakera41.
171359:15	i think 0 maybe th-, a judge is a better judge of that	maybe	###uh, but i'm not sure 0 i like that.###i think 0 i prefer the jury system myself.###speakerb12.###you think 0 you prefer the jury?###you think 0 your chances are better?###speakera13.###uh, well, actually i think 0 in most criminal cases it *exp*-1 wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury.### what, what i worry about *t*-1 is cases where it's the government against the individual *t*-2.###that's where you really need a jury of peers *t*-1.###because, uh, anytime 0 th-, the government, uh, is the government against the individual *t*-2 you need som-, y-, you need the protection of ordinary citizens.###speakerb14.###well, that's true.###speakera15.###i think 0 that's really the only thing.###i guess 0 where i would like *-1 to see the system change *t*-2 is,###uh, uh, there ought *-1 to be a, a###well i guess 0 i don't think that, uh, uh, juries need *-1 to decide sentencing all the time.###speakerb16.###uh-huh.###speakera17.
171367:5	maybe i'm too, too, uh, uh, conservative when it comes to that *t*-1.	maybe	###that's where you really need a jury of peers *t*-1.###because, uh, anytime 0 th-, the government, uh, is the government against the individual *t*-2 you need som-, y-, you need the protection of ordinary citizens.###speakerb14.###well, that's true.###speakera15.###i think 0 that's really the only thing.###i guess 0 where i would like *-1 to see the system change *t*-2 is,###uh, uh, there ought *-1 to be a, a###well i guess 0 i don't think that, uh, uh, juries need *-1 to decide sentencing all the time.###speakerb16.###uh-huh.###speakera17.###i think 0 maybe th-, a judge is a better judge of that###or, uh,###speakerb18.###well, s-, sometimes the sentencing is still, is not fair.###i mean even if, well the jury, i guess 0 they do decide that### but, but, i'm like you,###in a case like that, most of the time its,###i don't know,
171379:190	but people who *t*-4 d-, don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like *t*-1 and what the options are *t*-2, * to ask them *-3 to decide for one case, on one person, based on what they see *t*-5, i think 0 that is maybe, uh, a little bit naive.	maybe	###i think 0 maybe th-, a judge is a better judge of that###or, uh,###speakerb18.###well, s-, sometimes the sentencing is still, is not fair.###i mean even if, well the jury, i guess 0 they do decide that### but, but, i'm like you,###in a case like that, most of the time its,###i don't know,###maybe i'm too, too, uh, uh, conservative when it comes to that *t*-1.### th-, the sentencing is really light compared to what i think 0 they should be *t*-1 in a lot of cases you know,###uh,###speakera19.###yeah.###speakerb20.###speakera21.###well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom, i trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent.###that's usually a matter of who * to believe *t*-2 and what facts * to believe *t*-1.###speakerb22.###right.###speakera23.
171406:26	but, the thing is too, 0 maybe they need more of a, i don't know, more of a expert types to, to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick, you know, joe blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever an-, and call them in.	maybe	###speakera27.###uh, it's kind of, uh, uh, a hanging jury atmosphere.###speakerb28.###right.###speakera29.###but in a lot of places, i think 0 people bend over the other way,###but i guess, i guess 0 i like the system that they have *t*-1 in some places where the defendant gets *-3 to choose whether he's, goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets *t*-2 to choose it *t*-4.### some, some cases in some jurisdictions, they can do that.###speakerb30.###oh really?###speakera31.###i kind of like that system.###yeah.###speakerb32.###yeah.### that's, that's not a bad system.###but i, i do think 0 it needs *-1 to be shaken *-2 up a little bit.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.
171483:32	but that's, that's probably the worst.	probably	###uh, what about you?###speakera7.###well, i don't have so much trouble with products as service.###speakerb8.###uh-huh.###speakera9.###i don't feel like that's as big a problem.###i've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because i've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly.###speakerb10.###uh-huh.###speakera11.###and i'm not convinced *-1 that any of them work a hundred percent.###speakerb12.###uh-huh.###speakera13.###uh, the one 0 i have *t*-1 now is okay, most of the time.###speakerb14.###uh-huh.###speakera15.###but that's it.
171551:8	they might work on that, you know.	might	###and i said well i really appreciate it.###i said 0 there seems *-1 to be a big attitude problem in that, store###speakerb30.###speakera31.###and it turned out 0 she was the assistant manager###so,###speakerb32.###well at least you're talking to somebody who *t*-1 counts.###speakera33.###right.###so i felt kind of good about that, you know.###i didn't even know the person *ich*-2's name that *t*-1 had given me the hard time or anything###speakerb34.###uh-huh.###speakera35.###speakerb36.###right.###speakera37.###but i just felt like, well at least i did something.###maybe they'll fix it.
171586:32	and you know, no matter how crabby you might be *t*-1 over the phone, they are very understanding	might	###i mean i've, i've, i, i have friends and family who *t*-1 order from them because you can, you can literally,###i've heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year, wear it for a year and a half, and even after, like eighteen months of, you know, reasonably satisfactory use, they will accept it in any condition *t*-1###and they will gladly, no questions asked *-1, take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide 0 you don't want it anymore.###uh, they'll, they'll actually do things like this.###i mean they're really, they, they go-, bend over backwards service wise for you.### i've, uh i've found also 0 a lot of companies nowadays, have, they have eight hundred numbers 0 you can call *t*-1.###speakera43.###that's really great.###speakerb44.###i guess 0 if, if you call the e-, any eight hundred number, uh, if, you, you can call up e-, any eight hundred number directory assistance, and you can get, uh, the eight hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies.###and, um, actually i've tried that with a few companies lately.###and they've, most of them have been pretty good,###but i, i was,###one reason why, i, like i buy a lot of clothing through mail order *t*-1 is that, uh, if you buy through bean or though,###uh, i guess 0 bean's, one of bean's big competitors is land's end out in, uh, i guess 0 it's *rnr*-1 wisconsin somewhere.### they, they are, uh, they're very good about uh, * insur-,###speakera45.###huh.###speakerb46.###like the customer is always right
171616:44	uh, and i only update that, oh i don't know, maybe once every quarter or so. every three months. just, basically when the statements come in *t*-1. you know. *-2 just to see whether or not we're falling, you know, getting ahead, falling behind or staying even or what.	maybe	###speakera51.###i don't think 0 most places are like that anymore.###speakerb52.###yeah.###well i think, i guess nowadays with the, uh, with the economy the way 0 it is *t*-1, i guess,### there was a, there was a story on the news tonight about how, because a lot of companies are, uh, you know,###things are getting rough out there,###there's a lot of, you know,###the morale among employees tends *-1 to go down###and that, in turn, like, you know,###speakera1.###well, we, in, in, in our family, have been pretty remiss in *-1 trying *-2 to, uh, you know, keep track of, uh, daily finances.###uh, the, uh, way back, what, twelve years ago or something when i got my first computer *t*-3, i did what everybody else does *t*-4, which *t*-1 is * to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks, and, you know, checkbooks and all this kind of thing###and we kept that going for about a month###and it became so onerous that we gave up on it.###speakerb2.###uh-huh.###that sounds about right.###speakera3.###you know, so, uh, the only thing 0 we're, you know, that we do *t*-1 now is, uh, i keep a, a little spread sheet of, uh, what i call *t*-2 the net worth calculation which *t*-3 is just the, the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth.
171680:10	but they probably won't *?* because next week the kids have school vacation.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakerb22.###so, uh, right now, we're on, we get f-, you know, aid from the state at this point because there's no other way 0 * to do it *t*-1.###and my ex-husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support.###speakera23.###oh dear.###speakerb24.###so right now i know what i'm getting *t*-1 from the state###and, uh, i have *-1 to balance, more or less, what i get *t*-2 from the state with my bills and, uh, you know, try *-3 to work as many days as possible. any time 0 they call me in *t*-4.###speakera25.###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###but i still have *-1 to figure out.###if i work too many days, then i lose all my state aid###and if i don't work enough days then i don't get enough * to meet the bills###and it's like a juggling act every single month.###speakera27.###uh-huh.###speakerb28.###like this week i've been just holding my breath and hoping 0 they'll call me in
171738:22	but at the present stage, you probably are even more *ich*-1 in the market for a, a budgetary thing than, than most people probably ar-, might be *?*. in terms of * keeping, keeping score of input and output.	probably	###speakerb42.###really.###speakera43.###but, uh, you know, they just folded it up and, uh, uh, told him *-1 to,###they took the top management and gave them jobs with the, with the corporate, uh, at the corporate front office###speakerb44.###uh-huh.###speakera45.###and everybody else was sent *-1 packing.###speakerb46.###oh.###speakera47.###uh, * hang on one second###i've got###speakerb48.###sure.###speakera49.###uh, mumblex somebody was knocking on my door here.###uh, it sounds like, in a certain sense, at least at the present,###i mean, it sounds, sounds terrible 0 * to say *t*-1,
171738:95	but at the present stage, you probably are even more *ich*-1 in the market for a, a budgetary thing than, than most people probably ar-, might be *?*. in terms of * keeping, keeping score of input and output.	probably	###speakerb42.###really.###speakera43.###but, uh, you know, they just folded it up and, uh, uh, told him *-1 to,###they took the top management and gave them jobs with the, with the corporate, uh, at the corporate front office###speakerb44.###uh-huh.###speakera45.###and everybody else was sent *-1 packing.###speakerb46.###oh.###speakera47.###uh, * hang on one second###i've got###speakerb48.###sure.###speakera49.###uh, mumblex somebody was knocking on my door here.###uh, it sounds like, in a certain sense, at least at the present,###i mean, it sounds, sounds terrible 0 * to say *t*-1,
171738:110	but at the present stage, you probably are even more *ich*-1 in the market for a, a budgetary thing than, than most people probably ar-, might be *?*. in terms of * keeping, keeping score of input and output.	might	###speakerb42.###really.###speakera43.###but, uh, you know, they just folded it up and, uh, uh, told him *-1 to,###they took the top management and gave them jobs with the, with the corporate, uh, at the corporate front office###speakerb44.###uh-huh.###speakera45.###and everybody else was sent *-1 packing.###speakerb46.###oh.###speakera47.###uh, * hang on one second###i've got###speakerb48.###sure.###speakera49.###uh, mumblex somebody was knocking on my door here.###uh, it sounds like, in a certain sense, at least at the present,###i mean, it sounds, sounds terrible 0 * to say *t*-1,
171911:8	we might *?*.	might	###and the hand eye coordination###and it *exp*-1 takes a certain skill * to play hockey.###not everybody can play hockey.###speakera50.###yeah.###speakerb51.###so we,###and###that's,###we're a big hockey area up here,###i bet up here in new england as well as, you know, in, in the minnesota area###speakera52.###really.###speakerb53.###but,###speakera54.###i don't even think 0 we have that in texas.###speakerb55.###what, hockey?###speakera56.
171916:8	you probably know,	probably	###speakerb51.###so we,###and###that's,###we're a big hockey area up here,###i bet up here in new england as well as, you know, in, in the minnesota area###speakera52.###really.###speakerb53.###but,###speakera54.###i don't even think 0 we have that in texas.###speakerb55.###what, hockey?###speakera56.###we might *?*.###do we?###speakerb57.###speakera58.###i mean, no,
172074:5	maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who *t*-1 come back again and again.	maybe	###uh-huh.###speakerb109.###the atmosphere of * being there, you know.###speakera110.###yeah.###well, in high school i went to every football game###and, well, i twirled, you know.###speakerb111.###speakera112.###speakerb113.###yep.###speakera114.###and i, you know, i didn't,###i still don't know that much about football, obviously.###but i still had a good time. you know,###speakerb115.###well foot-,###speakera1.###well, th-, the question was talking about the juries###and, uh, one of the things 0 i thought about *t*-1 was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having *t*-2, that, especially for repeat offenders that, uh,
172094:33	and if they're judged *-1 guilty * would probably be in a better pri-, position 0 * to give an appropriate, uh, sentencing *t*-2.	probably	###maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who *t*-1 come back again and again.###uh, so that, uh, a judge, i think 0 *t*-3, would be the most appropriate person 0 *t*-1 to, uh, to be able *-2 to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day.###speakerb2.###right.### i, i kind of agree with that, because i think 0 in some cases, uh, the jury may not even have, the information about other crimes 0 the person has committed *t*-1.###speakera3.###speakerb4.###speakera5.###speakerb6.###speakera7.###right.###speakerb8.###uh, i, i think that in some cases that's considered *-1 to prejudice the current case###speakera9.###right.###speakerb10.###so a judge, you're right 0 *t*-1, should have the whole dossier of the criminal there###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.
172179:149	but i think 0 most lawyers do a pretty good job of * making that evident to, to clients unless they feel 0 they can, you know, tweak a jury into per-, *-1 giving a different sentence or possibly, if it's a civil case, giving higher, uh, you know, awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the, the award.	possibly	###well i think 0 that's all ready possible.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###i think, that you can waive the right to a, jury trial###uh,###speakera35.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###speakerb38.###yeah###speakera39.###right,###right.###speakerb40.###so. i agree that that should be encouraged *-1.###speakera41.###uh-huh.###speakerb42.###people should know that that's an option just in case they feel 0 they have *-1 to have a jury trial.
172202:51	well, uh, in the case of, civil, uh, things, i think maybe the, the use of the jury is very, often to the lawyer's advantage	maybe	###* giving a different sentence.###speakerb44.###speakera45.###uh-huh.###speakerb46.###speakera47.###the take.###right.###speakerb48.###yeah.###and i suspect it, in cases like,###i guess 0 we were supposed *-1 to be doing criminals *ich*-2 though, rather than civil.###is that right?###speakera49.###well, i, i, i-, we're at liberty *-1 to, to talk and, and meander as long as it's all on the same theme.###speakerb50.###yeah.###speakera51.###uh-huh.###speakerb52.
172210:45	i mean there are cases where they could be settled *-1, maybe out of court a little more efficiently *t*-2.	maybe	###speakerb48.###yeah.###and i suspect it, in cases like,###i guess 0 we were supposed *-1 to be doing criminals *ich*-2 though, rather than civil.###is that right?###speakera49.###well, i, i, i-, we're at liberty *-1 to, to talk and, and meander as long as it's all on the same theme.###speakerb50.###yeah.###speakera51.###uh-huh.###speakerb52.###well, uh, in the case of, civil, uh, things, i think maybe the, the use of the jury is very, often to the lawyer's advantage###speakera53.###speakerb54.###speakera55.###speakerb56.###and i think 0 that may be where jury use is overdone *-1 *t*-2,###speakera57.###speakerb58.
172296:70	and i have really resisted the impulse *-1 to get one for the home. uh, up until, i guess, maybe about a year and a half ago,	maybe	###speakerb88.###we didn't do the sentencing.###the judge did.###speakera89.###huh.###speakerb90.###so###speakera91.###how interesting.###speakerb92.### we, we a-, rendered a verdict###and then the judge was the one 0 *t*-1 to do the sentencing.###speakera93.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakerb94.###and that was here in wisconsin.###so i, i don't know if that varies from state to state or if it,###speakera1.###actually, i've been involved in electronics *ich*-1 a long time. uh, in computers
172374:21	emil is, probably pulls down a third a-, of all my time.	probably	###speakerb20.###oh, yeah.###speakera21.###speakerb22.###yeah.###tha-,###speakera23.### at wo-, at work, uh, i'm a technologist, uh,###and i, in the past, have done a great deal of, of, uh, system development just through, uh, software development programming.###uh, but now i find myself using the computer,###even the computer at work is primarily a, uh, word processing system and a communication system.###speakerb24.###uh-huh.###speakera25.###speakerb26.###yeah,###yeah.###do you use email and like that?###speakera27.###yes.
172490:52	but, uh, i'm afraid 0 i'm, i'm probably in the minority.	probably	###speakera8.###no it's,###speakerb9.###speakera10.###* say what?###speakerb11.###i just barely got home from the university.###speakera12.###* tell you 0 what we can do *t*-1 is, uh, 0 i can punch the, uh, one,###speakerb13.###speakera14.###and then w-, after five minutes when the, uh, uh, voice comes on *t*-1, we can talk all night if we want.###speakerb15.###okay,###* go ahead,###* fire away.###speakera16.###uh, i love the irony of, uh, * talking about this subject on april the, fifteenth.###speakerb17.###speakera18.
172534:74	well and i still think that, * having lived in europe for awhile, you know, difference in living conditions are certainly well worth, uh, what we pay *t*-1 for it.	certainly	###speakerb27.###in arizona.###speakera28.###is that right?###speakerb29.###uh-huh.###speakera30.###speakerb31.###but we have a pretty low income ta-, i mean pretty low tax rate here.###oh, i think 0 the, the sales tax, they just got *-1 to do something about it.###speakera32.###right.###speakerb33.###but that's the politicalness of * trying *-1 to not create any new taxes.###speakera34.###right.###but i guess 0 when i hear, when i see the comparison between the united states and, uh, any other western country *t*-1, uh, their, their rates are like, uh, forty-one, forty-two and ours are like thirty-six, thirty-seven, you know,###if you compute as a percentage of total income, all taxes lumped together, we actually do pretty well.### t-, th-, there's no other country that *t*-3's, that *t*-1 is taxed *-2 as low as we are *?*.###speakerb35.
172557:10	uh, probably m-, less so *ich*-1 now than it was *?* ten years ago or whatever	probably	###speakerb37.###speakera38.###uh-huh.### i'm, i'm not sure 0 i understand what you mean *t*-1.###speakerb39.###well, i mean, i think,###i was in germany, you know, for several years###speakera40.###right.###speakerb41.###and i'd a lot rather *ich*-3 pay taxes here and have what we have *t*-1, then * have *-2 to live there.###speakera42.###oh, you mean, lowest end of living in spite of lower, higher taxes.###yeah.###speakerb43.###higher taxes.###yeah.###speakera44.###i suppose 0 that's true,###yeah.
172584:26	that, that's probably a little tougher on you.	probably	###i think 0 the other problem is, you know, 0 it, it *exp*-1's easy * to complain about taxes because there's something 0 you, theoretically, can do something about *t*-2.###speakera48.###right.###speakerb49.###but i look, for example,###and you're not quite in the same situation###but like school taxes for me biggest bargain in the world.###speakera50.###right.###speakerb51.###i wish 0 i didn't have *-1 to pay any more *ich*-3 fo-, to my physicians in a year than i had *-2 to pay for all of my school taxes.###speakera52.###right.###speakerb53.###speakera54.###yeah.###yeah,###since, uh, i send my kids to parochial school, that mumblex.###speakerb55.###yeah,
172651:56	* belonging to a group is the, * belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection 0 you can have *t*-1 after you,	probably	###or build roads.###speakera74.###yeah.###speakerb75.###speakera76.###well,###speakera1.###uh, i think, uh,###actually i'm fairly pleased with the benefits that we have *t*-1 at the, uh, *-2 working for a large corporation.###and, for me, there's absolutely no question what *t*-1's the most important benefit###speakerb2.###right.###speakera3.###i think 0 it's health care.###it's what,###i think 0 everybody would say that.###speakerb4.###oh, and if you try *-1 to get it outside of your corporation, you're going *-2 to pay an arm and a leg.###speakera5.###right.
172682:7	or maybe they don't.	maybe	###but, uh, since i have three boys, uh, it, it can turn out *-1 to be important.###yeah,###you know###speakerb10.###oh, i know.###speakera11.### in a, in a given year, dental ca-, dental expenses can really kill you.###speakerb12.###now my husband is with, uh, northwest airlines###and he gets, uh, you know, the full health and dental###and, uh, we have four children###and what you pay *t*-1 *-2 just to have teeth cleaned *-3 is outrageous.###speakera13.###right.###speakerb14.###and i don't know how people that *t*-1 don't have it can afford it *t*-2.###speakera15.###right.###it's, uh,###speakerb16.
172861:14	and, uh, probably a good woman,	probably	###right.###speakera3.### and, uh, and so as, as a result, uh, you know, it's, it's a trade-off, you know, for the common good, you know. for, for the benefit of others, you know.###how much of your resource should you dedicate *t*-1 to, uh, * making things work for others?###have you, uh, you know, ever thought, you know, just how much of that money should, should *t*-2 go to other people that *t*-1 really don't deserve it?###speakerb4.###uh, well yeah.###i know 0 it's, it's a lot, you know, that, uh, that i feel like, you know, just like you said, that, there's just so much that you can do *t*-1 yourself. that you take care of your own self that you don't need the money for *t*-3###but they're giving it to other people that *t*-1 don't really need it ei-, either,###but yet they accept it.###speakera5.###well, the thing of it is, 0 if i wanted *-1 to just, uh, you know, permanently become a book reader, i guess 0 *t*-3 i could just, uh, you know, uh, go on public assistance, uh, you know lo-, lo-, look for, uh, look for people 0 *t*-2 to, uh, take care of me.###speakerb6.###speakera7.###speakerb8.###like so many people do.###speakera9.###speakerb10.###uh-huh.###speakera11.
172945:95	at thirty-three hundred dollars or thirty-five hundred dollars 0 i'm paying *t*-1 in taxes, why i, i could go down to bulverde and probably rent a, rent a house for that, right?	probably	###but there, this is, this is, tax not tax revolt country.###i mean there's too many,### every one of us, most of us have our, have all four feet *ich*-1 in the trough, you know. plus our snout, right up to our ears.###speakerb38.###yeah.###speakera39.###so, you know, it's not exactly that kind of a place that, that you want *-1 to, you know, get into a tax revolt situation *t*-2.###speakerb40.###right.###speakera41.###but, uh, uh, the, uh, the local taxes here *ich*-1, i, i, i-, in this particular area, uh, you know, i've, uh, i think 0 i pay about, uh, oh thirty-five hundred *ich*-3 for, for taxes on my four bedroom house, you know. and which *t*-2 is a lot of money.###speakerb42.###right.###speakera43.### an-, and, uh, and so as, as people get older and older, uh, you know, they think about retirement and that sort of thing###speakerb44.###uh-huh.###speakera45.### and, and they, they're building old people's homes, uh, you know, at tax expense.###well i think, you know, 0 the old people ought *-2 to just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper *t*-1.
172962:20	but, uh, there's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer *t*-1.	certainly	###speakera45.### and, and they, they're building old people's homes, uh, you know, at tax expense.###well i think, you know, 0 the old people ought *-2 to just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper *t*-1.###at thirty-three hundred dollars or thirty-five hundred dollars 0 i'm paying *t*-1 in taxes, why i, i could go down to bulverde and probably rent a, rent a house for that, right?###speakerb46.###yeah,###that's right.###speakera47.###you know. in, in, instead, it's, it's the taxes here###so.###speakerb48.###yeah.###speakera49.###course i don't know whether i want *-1 to go to bulverde *ich*-2 or not, you know or seguin or someplace like that.###speakerb50.###yeah.###speakera51.###speakerb52.###yeah.###speakera53.
172996:20	so. well, it's certainly, uh, uh,	certainly	###i'm going *-1 to have *-2 go out and, you know, in, you know, east fork someplace. and, and, do my thing, you know.###speakerb58.###right.###speakera59.###speakerb60.###my parents are in the same situation, you know.### they, their home is paid for *-1###but still their taxes are so high, that, you know, my father doesn't feel like he can retire because they couldn't pay their taxes.###and they have no children in school or, you know, anything now.###they don't use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards *t*-1.###speakera61.###right.### they, they redecorated in nineteen seventy-five, you know.###speakerb62.###uh, yeah.###speakera63.###and they're not doing it a-, again, you know.###speakerb64.###yeah.###speakera65.
173088:8	we might go again on a, on a van.	might	###so i wouldn't hesitate *-1 to get another one.### i, i never buy new###so i wouldn't hesitate *-1 to get another used truck.###speakerb21.###you're just like me.###i've never bought a new vehicle in my life.###speakera22.###and, uh, yeah,### i don't, i don't need *-1 to pay for the glitz.###i'll let somebody else, uh, have the showroom shine###speakerb23.###no.###speakera24.###mumblex and i'll pay for the rest of it.###speakerb25.###* let somebody else break it in,###right.###speakera26.###right.###and, uh, the van 0 we're sor-,
173089:26	we, we could probably do with a, a, something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time.	probably	### i, i never buy new###so i wouldn't hesitate *-1 to get another used truck.###speakerb21.###you're just like me.###i've never bought a new vehicle in my life.###speakera22.###and, uh, yeah,### i don't, i don't need *-1 to pay for the glitz.###i'll let somebody else, uh, have the showroom shine###speakerb23.###no.###speakera24.###mumblex and i'll pay for the rest of it.###speakerb25.###* let somebody else break it in,###right.###speakera26.###right.###and, uh, the van 0 we're sor-,###we might go again on a, on a van.
173105:32	and, uh, th-, it certainly had that.	certainly	###speakera26.###right.###and, uh, the van 0 we're sor-,###we might go again on a, on a van.### we, we could probably do with a, a, something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time.###i'm not sure.###speakerb27.###yeah.###speakera28.### we have *-2 to, we, we'll have *-1 to face it in a couple of years###but, uh, i, i guess, 0 we had a small toyota wagon###speakerb29.###speakera30.###speakerb31.###right.###speakera32.###and we were real happy with that because, uh, my, my second requirement after price is, uh, low maintenance.###speakerb33.###right.###speakera34.
173225:56	i, i mean, the only thing 0 i think 0 i might get *t*-1, a new car or, not necessarily a new car but, a, another car,	might	###speakerb71.###h-,###when was the last time 0 you took out, took your truck out *t*-4 * just to, *-1 just to go *-2 driving *t*-3?###speakera72.###speakerb73.###yeah.###speakera74.###no.###speakerb75.###and i go out twice a week on the bike, so. at least. just for the enjoyment.###speakera76.###yeah.###speakerb77.###speakera78.###uh.###speakerb79.###speakera80.###yeah.###speakerb81.###but, yeah,
173336:46	uh, i was told *-1 by her preschool teacher that she thought 0 maybe she was to immature for kindergarten	maybe	###speakera9.###or,###speakerb10.###speakera11.###a lot of testing?###speakerb12.###uh, well it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade.###speakera13.###uh-huh.###speakerb14.###my son leaves the house at seven thirty and doesn't get home until three o'clock.###speakera15.###uh-huh.###speakerb16.###and i think 0 that's such a long day for a kindergartner.###speakera17.###i do too,### i, oh, i think 0 that's awful.###speakerb18.###and, uh, i have a preschooler.
173364:30	i, we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now.	maybe	###speakera21.###we have all kinds of testing###and it's over and over.###it's i t b s or, and, uh, just everything, everything.###speakerb22.###yeah.###speakera23.###and they test, test, test.###i live in plano actually###and i don't know if you've heard of plano###but it's a very transient community.###speakerb24.###no.###speakera25.###a lot of people from everywhere,###it's just north of dallas###speakerb26.###uh-huh.###speakera27.###and it's grown in leaps and bounds.
173585:47	i think 0 capital punishment, uh, uh, was or probably stringent enough	probably	###mumblex capital punishment, uh, i guess, out in california is, has had a lot of, uh, a lot of, you know, discourse in the paper.###uh, apparently, you know, there's, they haven't, uh, executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven, i believe 0 *t*-1.###speakerb2.###uh, yeah.### that's, that's as far back as i can remember.###well, that's before my time actually.###speakera3.###yeah,###they,###speakerb4.###speakera5.###well, i, we were, we, uh, we just started, we lived in redwood city when we were out there *t*-1.###speakerb6.###uh-huh.###speakera7.### and, uh, and we found that, uh you know, it was a very liberal kind of community.###but the, uh, i, i really feel that, that the law enforcement community, uh, you know, puts these people behind bars###and then they, they, uh, uh, you know, lawyers, these lawyer groups get together###and they, uh, they, i think 0 *t*-1, extend beyond the normal, uh, appeal process. uh, you know, and just drag these, this guy, uh, his, his, uh, ultimate, uh, demise out for ten or fifteen years.###uh, and i, i think that, uh, that there's something that *t*-1 has *-2 to be changed *-3 in the system * to, to do that.
173590:115	do, do you feel as though there should be, uh, more, uh, was or, or more, uh, you might say transgressions that *t*-1 would be enforceable by, uh, by, uh, uh, capital punishment?	might	###well, that's before my time actually.###speakera3.###yeah,###they,###speakerb4.###speakera5.###well, i, we were, we, uh, we just started, we lived in redwood city when we were out there *t*-1.###speakerb6.###uh-huh.###speakera7.### and, uh, and we found that, uh you know, it was a very liberal kind of community.###but the, uh, i, i really feel that, that the law enforcement community, uh, you know, puts these people behind bars###and then they, they, uh, uh, you know, lawyers, these lawyer groups get together###and they, uh, they, i think 0 *t*-1, extend beyond the normal, uh, appeal process. uh, you know, and just drag these, this guy, uh, his, his, uh, ultimate, uh, demise out for ten or fifteen years.###uh, and i, i think that, uh, that there's something that *t*-1 has *-2 to be changed *-3 in the system * to, to do that.###i think 0 capital punishment, uh, uh, was or probably stringent enough###but i think 0 the appeal process is really getting in the way.###speakerb8.###uh-huh.###speakera9.
173600:99	uh, the laws exist and mumblex are frequently upheld *-3 in, in, uh, in appeals court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find *t*-2.	maybe	### and, uh, and we found that, uh you know, it was a very liberal kind of community.###but the, uh, i, i really feel that, that the law enforcement community, uh, you know, puts these people behind bars###and then they, they, uh, uh, you know, lawyers, these lawyer groups get together###and they, uh, they, i think 0 *t*-1, extend beyond the normal, uh, appeal process. uh, you know, and just drag these, this guy, uh, his, his, uh, ultimate, uh, demise out for ten or fifteen years.###uh, and i, i think that, uh, that there's something that *t*-1 has *-2 to be changed *-3 in the system * to, to do that.###i think 0 capital punishment, uh, uh, was or probably stringent enough###but i think 0 the appeal process is really getting in the way.###speakerb8.###uh-huh.###speakera9.### do, do you feel as though there should be, uh, more, uh, was or, or more, uh, you might say transgressions that *t*-1 would be enforceable by, uh, by, uh, uh, capital punishment?###speakerb10.###well i think that currently the way 0 the law stands *t*-1 isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not,###it's more 0 they're not enforcing the death penalty itself.###it's at that point where they're saying like here you're, you're going on death row *t*-1###but you'll stay there for twenty years.###speakera11.###uh-huh.###speakerb12.###and nothing is being done *-1 about it.
173671:137	of course, if he's fallen in love with drugs and there isn't anything but * getting stoned or high is, is the only thing in life that *t*-1 seems *-2 to be meaningful, then maybe there is no hope.	maybe	###speakera5.### and, and i quite frankly, don't see anything wrong with it.### i, i'm, i guess 0 i'm not a good civil libertarian.###speakerb6.###speakera7.### and, and i, i feel as though, uh, that, uh, uh, you know, that if you, you're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that *t*-1's difficult unless you really go into a deep background.###of course, we're, we're,###* being involved in my organization, uh, we, we have deep background checks### and and so, uh, but, but, sometimes, you know, drug use can, can escape that.###speakerb8.###sure,###sure.###speakera9.###and, uh, i have absolutely no compunction about, uh, * using any and all means * to, to, uh, uh, you know, work out, figure out who *t*-3 has a drug program or who *t*-1 has a drug problem and, uh, and putting that guy into, into therapy to, whatever it is *t*-2 * to, to, you know, break this, uh, activity.###speakerb10.###huh.###speakera11.###speakerb12.###uh-huh.###speakera13.
173677:55	uh, well i guess 0 i, i guess 0 i'm probably a little more to, toward the other direction.	probably	###of course, we're, we're,###* being involved in my organization, uh, we, we have deep background checks### and and so, uh, but, but, sometimes, you know, drug use can, can escape that.###speakerb8.###sure,###sure.###speakera9.###and, uh, i have absolutely no compunction about, uh, * using any and all means * to, to, uh, uh, you know, work out, figure out who *t*-3 has a drug program or who *t*-1 has a drug problem and, uh, and putting that guy into, into therapy to, whatever it is *t*-2 * to, to, you know, break this, uh, activity.###speakerb10.###huh.###speakera11.###speakerb12.###uh-huh.###speakera13.###of course, if he's fallen in love with drugs and there isn't anything but * getting stoned or high is, is the only thing in life that *t*-1 seems *-2 to be meaningful, then maybe there is no hope.###speakerb14.###yeah.###speakera15.###what's your, uh, feeling *t*-1?###speakerb16.
173707:18	i mean, prohibition certainly didn't last.	certainly	###uh, you know, we've had, i guess 0 *t*-1, laws against, uh, you know, various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years, i guess.###speakera19.###uh-huh.###speakerb20.###maybe a little longer.###speakera21.###well i think 0, uh, the dr-, the laws on, uh, uh, uh, the first morphine laws were, were like ninety, or nineteen ten or nineteen five, something like that.###speakerb22.###yeah.###so, ei-, eighty years or so.###yeah.###speakera23.###yeah.###speakerb24.###uh, so i, you know,### it's, it *ich*-5's hard * to, i guess, for me to justify what *t*-1 so-, seems like, you know, basically a breach of the first amen-, you know, freedom from, uh, search and seizure, you know, uh, on something that *t*-2 may *rnr*-3 or may not stand as a law, you know, fifty years *ich*-4 from now or even twenty or ten,###who *t*-1 knows.###speakera25.###well, the thing of it is 0 the, the, tha-, tha-, that, that is, uh, uh, in, in many respects, uh, uh, you know, just, just, i think 0 *t*-1, an over simplification.###speakerb26.
173744:228	but i, i, i, i think that, that the, that, you know, the, *-1 being in law enforcement, you know, th-, th-, th-, they, i, i probably have a kind of a draconian, philistine attitude toward it.	probably	###you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what, ten or twenty dollars an ounce.###speakera31.### i, i i must admit that,###speakerb32.###and clearly if you're into coke and all 0 you want *-2 to do *t*-1 is, you know, * snort your brains out all day long, if it was legal, you could do it real cheap###and, you know, you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###but, yeah,###get, uh,###speakera35.###yeah.### i, i must admit that the production costs of, of these drugs are, are zippo compared to the street market costs and, and the costs to society,###yeah.###speakerb36.###oh, yeah,###well that's why there's, you know, people dealing it because there's money in it *t*-1, you know.###there's ridiculous amounts of money.###speakera37.
174157:36	and, you know, the younger kids, uh, or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another.	maybe	###speakerb99.###now that's good.###i like that idea.###speakera100.###and * then never attend,###speakerb101.###speakera102.###but if, if they missed it, they had *-1 to abide by the rules.###speakerb103.###whatever *t*-1 was voted on *-2, huh.###speakera104.###yeah###and boy, they, they'd show up.###speakerb105.###well i think 0 that's great.###speakera106.###and we'd usually take notes###speakerb107.###yeah.###speakera108.
174201:11	well i definitely think, like 0 decisions have *-1 to be unanimous.	definitely	###speakera1.###i'm nevin from sunnyvale, california.###speakerb2.###hi,###this is jim bliss from minneapolis, minnesota.###how you doing *t*-1?###speakera3.###pretty good.###speakerb4.###good.###uh, i guess 0 the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that *t*-2 or how we would change it *t*-1.###speakera5.###yep.###speakerb6.###uh, i'm ready whenever you are *?* *t*-1.###speakera7.###okay.###speakerb8.###so, uh, what are your, what are your thoughts on the subject *t*-1 there?###speakera9.
174205:21	i think 0 that's probably a good thing.	probably	###this is jim bliss from minneapolis, minnesota.###how you doing *t*-1?###speakera3.###pretty good.###speakerb4.###good.###uh, i guess 0 the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that *t*-2 or how we would change it *t*-1.###speakera5.###yep.###speakerb6.###uh, i'm ready whenever you are *?* *t*-1.###speakera7.###okay.###speakerb8.###so, uh, what are your, what are your thoughts on the subject *t*-1 there?###speakera9.###well i definitely think, like 0 decisions have *-1 to be unanimous.###speakerb10.###yeah.###yeah,
174207:11	it's probably the safest thing.	probably	###speakera3.###pretty good.###speakerb4.###good.###uh, i guess 0 the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that *t*-2 or how we would change it *t*-1.###speakera5.###yep.###speakerb6.###uh, i'm ready whenever you are *?* *t*-1.###speakera7.###okay.###speakerb8.###so, uh, what are your, what are your thoughts on the subject *t*-1 there?###speakera9.###well i definitely think, like 0 decisions have *-1 to be unanimous.###speakerb10.###yeah.###yeah,###i think 0 that's probably a good thing.###speakera11.
174233:4	definitely	definitely	###speakerb14.###and simple majority won't do.###speakera15.###no.###and even like, you know, two-thirds majority, i mean, it's,###speakerb16.###yeah,###that's,###yeah,###quorums are to easy 0 * to get *t*-1.###speakera17.###yep.###speakerb18.###and there's always that, that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason, you know.###speakera19.###speakerb20.###so it's, it's###speakera21.###yeah.###speakerb22.
174397:42	but, uh, that friend of mine's telling me that i might have *-1 to go in for, uh, as a witness.	might	###speakera79.###i really,###speakerb80.###from what i understand *t*-1, it's all pretty the same except when you get to louisiana *t*-2.###speakera81.###speakerb82.###and louisiana is completely different cause it was based *-1 on the, what is it *t*-1, it's based *-1 on common law###and the rest of the country is not *?* or something like that.###speakera83.###uh-huh.###speakerb84.###speakera85.###yeah.###speakerb86.###pretty strange.###but, uh, fortunately i never have had *-1 to go in even, even for jury duty.###speakera87.###yeah,###i haven't *?* either other than,###speakerb88.
174502:138	if some, if it *exp*-1 were possible * to market some, uh, form of, uh, space technology, you know, * to, uh, uh, to make it equitable, it might severely help the economy, you know, in the, in the, uh, respect that, you know, there's endless amounts of research 0 *t*-2 to be done *-3. endless amounts of resources and and whatnot,	might	###i used *-1 to think when i was, when i was younger *t*-2 that, uh, by this time we'd have lots more in stuff in space than we do now.###speakera21.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakerb22.###uh, frustrating at times.###speakera23.###uh-huh.###speakerb24.###i don't know what you think *t*-1 about all that.###speakera25.###well, uh, yo-, i, uh, i'm kind of young.###i'm only twenty-two###and so, uh, uh, i'm not, you know,###there's a lot that *t*-1's happened in my lifetime as far as, uh, you know, with the space shuttle and all. although plans * to, uh, go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted *-2 in comparison to, uh, the sixties.###speakerb26.###uh-huh.###speakera27.###uh, although i have a,### i, i kind of wonder uh,
174566:17	but the same money could probably be far better spent on, uh, uh, lunar bases and solar power satellite research and, you know, so forth.	probably	###sure,###that makes a lot of sense.###speakerb46.###the only problem is, of course, that, uh, that requires significant commitment from people * to actually decide 0 they want *-1 to put things like that up there.###speakera47.###uh-huh.###speakerb48.###speakera49.###yeah.###speakerb50.###and they want *-1 to do the research###and uh, they're all you know, nor-,###speakera51.###yeah.###speakerb52.###the only commitments that they're interested in *-1 making *t*-2 or even talking about *t*-2 are ones for flash value like, uh, the trip to mars. which *t*-3 is, would, would produce some useful scientific research and so forth,###speakera53.###right,###exactly.###speakerb54.
174621:34	well, i think 0 first degree murder, uh, probably warrants it.	probably	###speakerb72.###no need * to use this anymo-, to play around with this space stuff anymore.###that's what *t*-1 happened with apollo.###uh, but, uh, i'd give almost anything *-1 to get into space.###speakera73.###yeah.###i think 0 you're right.###speakerb74.###speakera75.###i would *?* too.### i'd, i'd, uh,###was it john denver that that *t*-1 tried *-2 to buy his way on to the space shuttle?###speakera1.###what do you think *t*-1 about capital punishment?###speakerb2.###well, i'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes.###speakera3.###yeah.###which crimes do you feel that *t*-1?###speakerb4.
174718:118	and you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system, you know. because they figure well, you know, sure i, i get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something.	maybe	###speakerb32.###and it's really, you know, it's, it gets *-1 to be a r-, a big problem.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###uh, * go ahead.###speakera35.###i wish 0 if they were going *-1 to do it, they would be a little more consistent in *-3 dealing with who *t*-2 gets lethal injection and who *t*-4 doesn't.###speakerb36.###right.###speakera37.###be a little more, you know,###* not being able *t*-1 to put it off for fifteen years.###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###yeah.###because a lot of these guys, you know, they get in###and they, they get off for good behavior###and, i don't know,###up in minnesota where i am *t*-1 now, they don't have the death penalty.
174720:52	if i, if i elicit good behavior i'm out in maybe five or ten.	maybe	###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###uh, * go ahead.###speakera35.###i wish 0 if they were going *-1 to do it, they would be a little more consistent in *-3 dealing with who *t*-2 gets lethal injection and who *t*-4 doesn't.###speakerb36.###right.###speakera37.###be a little more, you know,###* not being able *t*-1 to put it off for fifteen years.###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###yeah.###because a lot of these guys, you know, they get in###and they, they get off for good behavior###and, i don't know,###up in minnesota where i am *t*-1 now, they don't have the death penalty.###and you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system, you know. because they figure well, you know, sure i, i get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something.###uh, but then for,
174743:5	maybe mumblex,	maybe	###speakerb40.###oh, sure, you know.###speakera41.###goodness.###speakerb42.###i mean just because, like we said before, they don't have enough room in the jails uh, you know, there's a lot of incentive for them to be let *-1 out early.###speakera43.###uh-huh.###speakerb44.###speakera45.###yeah.###speakerb46.###but if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head, uh,###i don't know,###i think 0 that may solve a lot of that.###speakera47.###yeah.###speakerb48.###maybe not solve it,###but, i don't know,
174889:126	and i guess 0 the only drawback *ich*-2 0 i can see *t*-1 to, to drug testing is in, 0 in case you are on some sort of medication that *t*-3 might give some, uh, sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem.	might	###speakera7.###where do you work *t*-1?###speakerb8.###uh, well i'm a graduate student right now at carnegie mellon.###speakera9.###oh, okay.###oh, okay.###speakerb10.###and i, i just came from saint paul. uh, *-1 interviewing with three m.###speakera11.###huh.###speakerb12.###speakera13.###oh, great.###speakerb14.###and, uh, they have a policy for, uh, testing.### if you, if they make you an offer, then they'll test you right before you start.###speakera15.###right.###speakerb16.
174899:25	and that, that definitely happens, you know.	definitely	###huh.###speakerb12.###speakera13.###oh, great.###speakerb14.###and, uh, they have a policy for, uh, testing.### if you, if they make you an offer, then they'll test you right before you start.###speakera15.###right.###speakerb16.###and i guess 0 the only drawback *ich*-2 0 i can see *t*-1 to, to drug testing is in, 0 in case you are on some sort of medication that *t*-3 might give some, uh, sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem.###speakera17.###uh-huh.###speakerb18.###speakera19.###yeah.###speakerb20.###but i-,###speakera21.###yeah.
174964:8	you probably wondered, huh.	probably	###speakera37.###uh, they essentially,###no###i sure don't, uh,### they essentially, uh, they essentially, uh, made me the offer and then, and then, uh, did the drug testing thing after that.###so, uh, it was one of those things where you go through the, the general battery of all their tests *t*-1### and, and then, they essentially give you the offer###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###speakera39.###and then at that point they'll, they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that.###speakerb40.###oh.###speakera41.###so, uh, there's some noise on this end.###i'm actually in a mall *-1 calling###so###speakerb42.###oh.###speakera43.
174974:8	they probably give you a chance *-1 to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance *-2 to go through it.	probably	###and then at that point they'll, they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that.###speakerb40.###oh.###speakera41.###so, uh, there's some noise on this end.###i'm actually in a mall *-1 calling###so###speakerb42.###oh.###speakera43.###you probably wondered, huh.###but,###speakerb44.###yeah.### wh-, what *t*-1 happens if you were *-2 to fail?###then do they give you like one ch-, one more chance or two more chances?###speakera45.###yes.###that's a good question.###i believe from what *ich*-2 i remember *t*-1 of the literature 0 they gave, uh, if you fail i believe they give you one more chance.
174974:41	they probably give you a chance *-1 to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance *-2 to go through it.	maybe	###and then at that point they'll, they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that.###speakerb40.###oh.###speakera41.###so, uh, there's some noise on this end.###i'm actually in a mall *-1 calling###so###speakerb42.###oh.###speakera43.###you probably wondered, huh.###but,###speakerb44.###yeah.### wh-, what *t*-1 happens if you were *-2 to fail?###then do they give you like one ch-, one more chance or two more chances?###speakera45.###yes.###that's a good question.###i believe from what *ich*-2 i remember *t*-1 of the literature 0 they gave, uh, if you fail i believe they give you one more chance.
175030:53	and, uh, you know, that's the kind of thing that *t*-1 would definitely come up, you know.	definitely	### did, do they test you at, right now, at work too?###speakera59.###no,###no.###that's one thing 0 they don't do *t*-1 is, is drug testing while you're on the job.###speakerb60.###okay.###speakera61.###uh, i think, i think 0 the unwritten rule is, yeah, * expect it###but they don't do it.###speakerb62.###oh.###speakera63.###you know, so. that's good i guess 0 *t*-1.###i don't know.###i mean, i, uh, i have gone to a couple of parties since, since that time###and while i don't do any drugs myself, i've seen some people who *t*-1 work there, uh, you know, smoking a joint or whatever.###speakerb64.###uh-huh.###speakera65.
175036:36	is it *exp*-1 formal policy that they said 0 they might test?	might	###okay.###speakera61.###uh, i think, i think 0 the unwritten rule is, yeah, * expect it###but they don't do it.###speakerb62.###oh.###speakera63.###you know, so. that's good i guess 0 *t*-1.###i don't know.###i mean, i, uh, i have gone to a couple of parties since, since that time###and while i don't do any drugs myself, i've seen some people who *t*-1 work there, uh, you know, smoking a joint or whatever.###speakerb64.###uh-huh.###speakera65.###and, uh, you know, that's the kind of thing that *t*-1 would definitely come up, you know.###but no,### they don't, they don't really do that.###so.###speakerb66.###wow.
175144:13	and that's certainly is a lot of students 0 for one person to deal with *t*-1 on an every day basis.	certainly	###my husband and i go to the store###and we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication, division things###and i feel like, uh, there are several areas that we're just really, really slow in *t*-1.###speakera37.###uh-huh.###speakerb38.###and, uh, i don't blame the teachers as much as i blame the system.###it is,###speakera39.###what do you think 0 *t*-1's wrong * to cause that?###speakerb40.### well, well, for one thing there's not enough money in the school system.###and the money 0 they do have *t*-1, they're not, they do not use it wisely.###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###uh, she, my son's teacher has twenty-seven students.###speakera43.###uh-huh.###speakerb44.
175224:38	uh, we had a school that *t*-1 had classes probably about the same size 0 you're talking *t*-2, twenty-seven, thirty kids to sc-, to a class.	probably	### teachers, you have *-1 to admit that teachers have *-2 to slow things down for people who *t*-3 don't understand, especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school.###speakerb68.###well,###and you can't put all the children in special education.###speakera69.###that's right,###you can't do that.###speakerb70.###uh, and if the parents do not care enough * to take an interest in whether the homework is done *-1 you know.###speakera71.###right.###speakerb72.###speakera73.###see, i grew up in nebraska###speakerb74.###uh-huh.###speakera75.###and the school that i went to *t*-1 there was fantastic.###it,### i, i really consider myself very, very lucky.
175386:43	i'm, i'm sure 0 you've probably heard of marion berry.	probably	###speakera45.###and, uh i, i think 0 they should *?*.###speakerb46.###we do.###speakera47.### i, and i think 0 if a person is guilty of *-1 taking someone's life and like you say, it's, it's, there's no doubt whatsoever. like drunk drivers that *t*-2 kill people###and, uh, you know, all###speakerb48.###right.###speakera49.### they, they're caught *-1 dead to rights.### i, i just think that that's, they've, they've taken a life###and if, they should pay for it with their life.###speakerb50.###right.###when you're saying as far as the appeal, uh, procedure was concerned *-1 *t*-2.###speakera51.###yeah.###speakerb52.###we just have the case,
175414:36	the, appeal procedure is the only thing 0 i can possibly think of *t*-1.	possibly	###so, i mean, his appeal was denied *-1###and two days later he got out of jail. for cocaine possession.###speakera57.###it, uh,,###speakerb58.###speakera59.###yeah.###speakerb60.###but, uh, that was absurd.### there is never, there was no reason 0 the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence *t*-1.###speakera61.###i know that, that mumblex.###speakerb62.###speakera63.###uh-huh.###and, i don't know.###uh, what would you do *t*-1 *-2 to change it? to make it better?###speakerb64.###well, uh, the, the only### i can, i wa-, you know,
175476:7	and maybe that's, that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world 0 * to, to do *t*-1.	maybe	###right.###speakera83.###speakerb84.###right.###that you can't, you can't remove the jury regardless of the case.###speakera85.###yeah.###speakerb86.###i mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place###speakera87.###yeah.###speakerb88.###and you, you'd still, there's still mitigating circumstances.###speakera89.###well, i, i,###speakera1.###see, wh-, when you're with a big company or a big organization *t*-1, a lot of times, uh, you know, the benefits are good### and, and, you know, the pay is regular###but, uh, you know, sometimes you don't get tuned *-2 in to what *t*-1's going on.###and i, i think 0 the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that, that, uh, that anybody could get *t*-1 in, in * dealing with a large company is * to be in a situation where you, you get *-4 to know what *t*-2's going on *t*-3.
175476:35	and maybe that's, that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world 0 * to, to do *t*-1.	probably	###right.###speakera83.###speakerb84.###right.###that you can't, you can't remove the jury regardless of the case.###speakera85.###yeah.###speakerb86.###i mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place###speakera87.###yeah.###speakerb88.###and you, you'd still, there's still mitigating circumstances.###speakera89.###well, i, i,###speakera1.###see, wh-, when you're with a big company or a big organization *t*-1, a lot of times, uh, you know, the benefits are good### and, and, you know, the pay is regular###but, uh, you know, sometimes you don't get tuned *-2 in to what *t*-1's going on.###and i, i think 0 the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that, that, uh, that anybody could get *t*-1 in, in * dealing with a large company is * to be in a situation where you, you get *-4 to know what *t*-2's going on *t*-3.
175545:66	and, you know, if you don't really count. if you're not part of the program you might not get told *-1 for months.	might	###speakera15.###and mumblex###speakerb16.###and it, it,###speakera17.###for two years we didn't. and, we, which *t*-1 was a, kind of stupid.### but, uh, but our organization is doing something else t-, on monday.###uh, we're having a, for all unclassified programs, we're, we're having little tables put *-1 up in front of mumblex lab in the hallways###and every, all the other employees are going *-1 to come around and see what sort of things we do *t*-2. which i thought 0 *t*-3 was kind of interesting and, but, uh, but that, that sort, sort of thing.###speakerb18.###yeah,###that is interesting.###speakera19.###speakerb20.###speakera21.###but, if you, i think 0 you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what *t*-1's going on.###speakerb22.###exactly.###speakera23.### and, and, but of course most time, most of the time management has a hard time * distributing or getting the word out to the people who *t*-1 must know.
175546:10	or you might *?*, you know, if it doesn't impact you directly. or if your management doesn't think that.	might	###and mumblex###speakerb16.###and it, it,###speakera17.###for two years we didn't. and, we, which *t*-1 was a, kind of stupid.### but, uh, but our organization is doing something else t-, on monday.###uh, we're having a, for all unclassified programs, we're, we're having little tables put *-1 up in front of mumblex lab in the hallways###and every, all the other employees are going *-1 to come around and see what sort of things we do *t*-2. which i thought 0 *t*-3 was kind of interesting and, but, uh, but that, that sort, sort of thing.###speakerb18.###yeah,###that is interesting.###speakera19.###speakerb20.###speakera21.###but, if you, i think 0 you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what *t*-1's going on.###speakerb22.###exactly.###speakera23.### and, and, but of course most time, most of the time management has a hard time * distributing or getting the word out to the people who *t*-1 must know.###and, you know, if you don't really count. if you're not part of the program you might not get told *-1 for months.
175677:5	maybe it was in miami.	maybe	###speakerb22.###uh, but the, uh, orlando paper, uh, yeah, they, they refused *-1 to take it off of the lists###and they call every month.###speakera23.###huh.###speakerb24.###and when you have more than one phone number *t*-2, you get a call on each number 0 you have *t*-1.###speakera25.###good grief.###well, * let me ask you about this.###here's something that, uh, *t*-1 has been kind of concerning me lately.###my fiance received a bill from a, a lord and taylor company,###speakerb26.###speakera27.###uh, you know, they're a, they're a department store.###speakerb28.###uh-huh.###speakera29.###she received a bill *ich*-1 from them, uh, that she had visited some sto-,### and, and i think 0 it was there in florida,
175723:8	she probably won't be ab-, able *-1 to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle.	probably	###uh-huh.###speakerb42.###and since it wasn't shipped *-1 to her address, she could prove, you know, that it wasn't her.###uh, if it was some you know, * coming into the store and stuff, then she would ha-, whoever *t*-1 made the purchase would have had *-2 find some kind of, uh, you know, document###speakera43.###yeah.###speakerb44.###and, uh, wh-,###the signature, uh,###they should be able *-1 to provide you a copy with that signature###and if they can't provide a signature, you know, they'll have *-1 to eat the charge.###speakera45.###yeah.###well, y-,###speakerb46.###but if the pers-, has, you know, their social s-, her social security number, i'd be real concerned that they, uh, that she's not, uh, blacklist *-1 on, uh, tel-, what is it *t*-2, it's *rnr*-3 telecredit or something?###speakera47.###yeah.###speakerb48.###uh, because she won't be able *-1 to cash checks because most places verify through there.
175738:54	and, uh, but on the whole i think 0 it, uh, probably was the wrong thing 0 * to do *t*-1.	probably	###but if the pers-, has, you know, their social s-, her social security number, i'd be real concerned that they, uh, that she's not, uh, blacklist *-1 on, uh, tel-, what is it *t*-2, it's *rnr*-3 telecredit or something?###speakera47.###yeah.###speakerb48.###uh, because she won't be able *-1 to cash checks because most places verify through there.###she probably won't be ab-, able *-1 to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle.###speakera49.###yeah.###well, we got it cleared *-1 up eventually.###what *t*-1 happened, uh,###speakera1.###uh, i'm of the age that *t*-1 could have gone, although i didn't###and, uh, i guess, uh, *-1 looking back on it, i tend *-1 to think 0 it was pretty, uh, mostly a mistake.###speakerb2.###uh-huh.###speakera3.###on the other hand, uh, the more 0 i learn *t*-2 about the history, the more i see 0 it was incremental, uh, decisions. any one of which *t*-1 was sort of understandable at the time *t*-3.###speakerb4.###uh-huh.###speakera5.
175791:16	uh, they're certainly all leaders	certainly	###yeah.###speakerb18.###but that they weren't really allowed *-1 to do anything.###i, uh,###to me it seems like we only went halfway. if even halfway.###speakera19.###yeah,###it's funny.###tonight i was, uh, helping my kid with an essay on, uh, stalin.###speakerb20.###speakera21.###speakerb22.###uh-huh.###speakera23.###and i was thinking in the course of * talking to him about it, how, uh, in world war two, the personalties of stalin, hitler and churchill more or less defined the war *t*-1###and actually when you think back on the big events of the war *t*-1, it was, uh, it was almost a personal struggle among these three,###uh, i guess 0 you'd have *-1 to call them great men in some sense.###speakerb24.###uh-huh.###speakera25.
175801:58	* looking back, it seems like that was only partly true. that, uh, there might have been a better place 0 * to draw the line *t*-1.	might	###speakera21.###speakerb22.###uh-huh.###speakera23.###and i was thinking in the course of * talking to him about it, how, uh, in world war two, the personalties of stalin, hitler and churchill more or less defined the war *t*-1###and actually when you think back on the big events of the war *t*-1, it was, uh, it was almost a personal struggle among these three,###uh, i guess 0 you'd have *-1 to call them great men in some sense.###speakerb24.###uh-huh.###speakera25.###uh, they're certainly all leaders### and, uh, and, uh, with their nations pretty, pretty solidly behind each one of them.###speakerb26.###yeah.###speakera27.###and i got a feeling that some of that was involved in the, uh, early decisions of the vietnam war. that the, uh, people saw the cold war as, uh, you had *-1 to draw a line and, and defend it.###otherwise there'd be, they'd get you someplace else.###speakerb28.###uh-huh.###speakera29.
175815:37	and as you say, uh, * going halfway was probably worse than, uh, * committing, uh, committing to a completely and, uh, winning it, whatever that would mean *t*-1.	probably	###speakera27.###and i got a feeling that some of that was involved in the, uh, early decisions of the vietnam war. that the, uh, people saw the cold war as, uh, you had *-1 to draw a line and, and defend it.###otherwise there'd be, they'd get you someplace else.###speakerb28.###uh-huh.###speakera29.###* looking back, it seems like that was only partly true. that, uh, there might have been a better place 0 * to draw the line *t*-1.###uh, i guess 0 you can, i guess 0 you can say that a, a certain amount of resolve and willingness * to fight, uh, brought the cold war to an end.###but i don't think 0 you can just fight anywhere just, just in order *-1 to, uh, call the bully out and beat him.###and i have a feeling that that's part of what *t*-1 was involved in the vietnamese war.###they felt like this was a place where we could draw a line, beat them and they wouldn't come forward *t*-1.###speakerb30.###speakera31.###and, uh we were wrong.###speakerb32.###uh-huh.###speakera33.###but i, uh, you know,### the, like i said, the more 0 i hear *t*-2 about it, the more i can see each decision that *t*-1 was made *t*-1 as *-4 being understandable *t*-3.###but the accumulative effect was * to really get into a, a hopeless situation where,
175850:21	like i was thinking that maybe the most important effect 0 it had *t*-1 was * to make it *exp*-2, uh, possible and even popular * to, uh, criticize the government.	maybe	###speakera39.###yeah.###speakerb40.###and it was a, it was a traditional m-, the traditional battle of, kind of good versus evil, if you, you know whichever way it is *t*-1.###speakera41.###well you're not,###speakerb42.###but in, in the vietnam war it seems like it was,### a, a, the sides and the lines that *t*-1 were drawn *-2 are all confused as to who *t*-3's good and who *t*-4's bad### and and, uh, you know, the,###speakera43.###it's ambivalent,###yeah.###speakerb44.###even, it seems like even the people, you know,###had the south vietnamese, the north vietnamese and, of course, the laotians###and the cambodians weren't even supposed *-1 to be involved.###but,###speakera45.### what, what about the domestic effects
175852:42	that pendulum started *-1 to swing, uh, ma-, maybe even too far. to the point where, uh, uh, * supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the vietnam war on *t*-2.	maybe	###speakerb40.###and it was a, it was a traditional m-, the traditional battle of, kind of good versus evil, if you, you know whichever way it is *t*-1.###speakera41.###well you're not,###speakerb42.###but in, in the vietnam war it seems like it was,### a, a, the sides and the lines that *t*-1 were drawn *-2 are all confused as to who *t*-3's good and who *t*-4's bad### and and, uh, you know, the,###speakera43.###it's ambivalent,###yeah.###speakerb44.###even, it seems like even the people, you know,###had the south vietnamese, the north vietnamese and, of course, the laotians###and the cambodians weren't even supposed *-1 to be involved.###but,###speakera45.### what, what about the domestic effects###like i was thinking that maybe the most important effect 0 it had *t*-1 was * to make it *exp*-2, uh, possible and even popular * to, uh, criticize the government.###and they,
176056:8	it certainly is *?*.	certainly	###it just gets deposited *-1.### and, and, and my, my wife, you know, you know, looks at all those bills that *t*-1 come in###speakerb2.###speakera3.### and, you know, and all those people are counting on me * to have my wife pay them. you see,###and so our, our budgeting,### w-, we really don't have a formal budgeting situation.###every time 0 i've ever tried one *t*-1, it's, uh, i've just got wrapped *-2 in my inertia.###and, uh, i've just decided *-1 not to pursue it.###uh, what, what's your budget situation *t*-1?###speakerb4.###well, actually, uh, i've, i've had a couple of different situations.###my current one has been the most successful.###uh, at a certain point in life###an-, my husband, my ex-husband was an alcoholic.###and we got divorced *-1 back in the mid-seventies###and that left me with three teenagers.###speakera5.###you know, well a-, a-, actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets. isn't it *?*?###speakerb6.
176170:33	i mean, uh, i say 0 it might go for another thirteen	might	###well i,###speakera39.### bu-, but we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've, we've had two kids *ich*-2 in college that *t*-1 just have graduated in the past year.###speakerb40.###uh-huh.###speakera41.###so we're, you know, we don't have that.###speakerb42.###it's time for you to do these things then. right?###speakera43.###yeah,### it's, uh, it's about time that we did that *t*-1.###but, th-, the, the terrible part about it. i've looked at it all###and it all looks still pretty good to me.### why, why we need *-1 to replace it?###speakerb44.###speakera45.### but, but, un-, unfortunately my, my, my wife really feels as though it's, it's just been an inappropriate, uh, thing 0 *t*-1 to, to,###i mean that rug is thirteen years old,###why * not replace it *t*-1.
176350:30	you know, the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since mumblex.	maybe	###they could,###somebody will have a job at three hundred a week * to get off welfare###and you know, that's a good starting wage###speakerb48.###uh-huh.###speakera49.###but boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care.###speakerb50.###uh-huh.###speakera51.###speakerb52.###no,###even that, that really, i think, 0 i don't,###it's been awhile since i've looked at,###my youngest child is eight.###so it's been a little while since i've looked into, actually daycare centers.###but they are###speakera53.###huh.###speakerb54.
176380:59	uh, so your, you, i guess 0 you're probably in the same, uh, same situation 0 uh, we're in *t*-1.	probably	###something like that.###speakera59.###oh my.###speakerb60.###well, you know, but you made the comment *ich*-1 earlier, why would someone be interested in children *t*-2.###i mean it has been a real, uh,### th-, there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences.###and i think, i think 0 they have captured a certain market.###again the,###but then there are baby-sitting groups.###as a pediatrician, one of the things 0 we've been real concerned about *t*-1 is the infections.###speakera61.###uh-huh.###speakerb62.###as you start *-1 putting lots of little kids together, the infection rates that *t*-2 go around.###speakera63.###oh, yeah.###speakerb1.###speakera2.###okay.
176540:13	and he'll probably just sleep anyway.	probably	###speakera54.###he got sick,###yeah.###speakerb55.### same thing, same thing that the, her kids had *t*-1, right?###speakera56.###right.###well,###speakerb57.###and so, uh, we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock.###then he, she'd take my son and her daughter over t-, to kindergarten.###but s-,###that day, uh, i was saying now he, he's sick.###and she goes well, she goes, he has the same thing that all my kids have *t*-1.###that's what he got *t*-1, you know.###* goes, well, okay,###so it's not like he's going *-1 to infect her kids.###but then what *t*-1 happened was, is, i said, uh, he just threw up###and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty###so she said well she'll keep him home
176669:30	it, it, uh, certainly has no life threatening, uh, capabilities uh, you know, in, in my job.	certainly	###first off we don't, we don't have enough courage * to, uh, pick out the people that, that *t*-2 have some sort of indication of possible drug usage, uh, because that would offend them, uh, if they, if they weren't *?*.###so we'll just accuse everybody of *-1 using drugs and, make it all even.###speakerb15.###speakera16.###uh, and and, uh###speakerb17.###yeah.###speakera18.###speakerb19.###well, i-,###speakera20.###then, uh,### but and they,###so it's, a, a complete random testing### w-, well it's random in the sense that you don't know when.###it is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested *-1.###speakerb21.###huh.###speakera22.###uh, and, uh, you know, i, i sit at a terminal and, and write software all day.
176675:77	i, i agree that there are, there are, uh, jobs that *t*-1 are definitely life threatening	definitely	###yeah.###speakera18.###speakerb19.###well, i-,###speakera20.###then, uh,### but and they,###so it's, a, a complete random testing### w-, well it's random in the sense that you don't know when.###it is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested *-1.###speakerb21.###huh.###speakera22.###uh, and, uh, you know, i, i sit at a terminal and, and write software all day.### it, it, uh, certainly has no life threatening, uh, capabilities uh, you know, in, in my job.###speakerb23.###right.###and,###speakera24.### and, and, uh, yes
176733:9	about maybe, oh, close to a year ago now i guess, i, i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house.	maybe	### i, i've been with this company for, uh, for sixteen years now.###speakerb37.###okay,###so that this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this.###speakera38.###and, uh,###speakerb39.###speakera40.###no.### and it, and it, and it has, it has, you know,###they did that three or four years before they did it with everybody.###and i, uh, at that time i could justify it in terms of someone new *ich*-1 coming in, 0 you don't, you don't know *t*-2.###but, on the other hand, uh, someone new coming in that *t*-2 knows 0 they're going *-3 to have a test,###speakera1.###are you in the middle of anything?###speakerb2.###no.###i'm not in the middle of anything.###i've just,###about the last thing 0 i did *t*-1
176964:11	it's probably more there.	probably	###that's not,###speakera77.###* co-, cost me about five hundred dollars, six hundred dollars all together.###speakerb78.###yeah,###that's good.###that's not bad at all.###* didn't have *-1 to,###speakera79.###yeah.###speakerb80.### th-, the wood may###it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is *t*-1, you know.### to get, * to get good lumber it costs,###i don't know about dallas,###but arou-, even in this little town, it's, it's not cheap at all.###i was surprised.###speakera81.###i'd be surprised if it wasn't, uh, cheaper where you are *t*-1.###speakerb82.
176967:8	it probably comes from where you are *t*-1.	probably	###speakerb78.###yeah,###that's good.###that's not bad at all.###* didn't have *-1 to,###speakera79.###yeah.###speakerb80.### th-, the wood may###it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is *t*-1, you know.### to get, * to get good lumber it costs,###i don't know about dallas,###but arou-, even in this little town, it's, it's not cheap at all.###i was surprised.###speakera81.###i'd be surprised if it wasn't, uh, cheaper where you are *t*-1.###speakerb82.###it's probably more there.###speakera83.###well, yeah.
176971:21	that it probably does.	probably	###* didn't have *-1 to,###speakera79.###yeah.###speakerb80.### th-, the wood may###it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is *t*-1, you know.### to get, * to get good lumber it costs,###i don't know about dallas,###but arou-, even in this little town, it's, it's not cheap at all.###i was surprised.###speakera81.###i'd be surprised if it wasn't, uh, cheaper where you are *t*-1.###speakerb82.###it's probably more there.###speakera83.###well, yeah.###it probably comes from where you are *t*-1.###speakerb84.###yeah,###yeah,
177004:13	so that's probably about what you're paying *t*-1	probably	###yeah.###speakera91.###speakerb92.### i don't, i haven't, i mean, i haven't,###i used *-1 to live in dallas. in arlington, actually.###speakera93.###uh-huh.###speakerb94.### and, but that was just when i was a kid *t*-1###so i don't really know what the cost of living is even like *t*-1 in dallas anymore.###but it's, i don't know,###we're a college town###so that doesn't help us out any.###speakera95.###right.###east texas.###speakerb96.###mumblex###we have,###gas is a dollar t-, dollar twelve a gallon,
177037:8	well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that	maybe	###speakerb102.###you've got something going all the time.###speakera1.###uh, with regard to, uh, to jury trials. i, you know, i, i really feel as though, uh, jury trials are, are, uh, whatever system *t*-1 has been, been used *-3 historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the, the only kinds of things that you can use *t*-2. because the, the jurisprudence is, you know, based on, on, uh, you know, on accumulated n-, body of law.###and if, if you have a situation where you change that body of law *t*-1, then all of sudden they, they start, they could start *-2 going back and digging up all these cases that, uh, that *t*-3 would be handled *-4 differently were they judged *-5 by today's standards.###speakerb2.###mumblex.###speakera3.###so i, i really don't think 0 it, they can really do much of anything *-1 to change it.###what do you think *t*-1?.###speakerb4.###uh, i, i don't think so.###possibly in the jury selection would be the only,###speakera5.###speakerb6.###just for example, what we're seeing *t*-1 in california i guess *t*-2.###it makes 0 you wonder, uh, had the jury been a different group of people what *t*-1 would have happened with that outcome.###uh, and th-, and the problems that, that *t*-3 has come that *t*-4 has come from this decision that that jury came to *t*-1 after all of us witnessed what we did *t*-2 with the video tape beating. uh just makes you wonder i guess whether or not they,###speakera7.###well won't,
177077:10	and you might even be able *-1 to, to use it for, for a bombing test site, you know.	might	###speakera17.###and, uh, uh, just like the burning and looting is self-destruct.###speakerb18.###uh-huh.###speakera19.###everybody says well this is the nineties###speakerb20.###oh, yes.###speakera21.###and they're going *-1 to rebuild###and it'll be even better.###hey, what do you think *t*-1,###you know, some, some black guy with capital is going *-1 to come in and invest in that area?###speakerb22.###that's right.###speakera23.###with everybody with that mind set. they, they're they're going *-1 to, that whole area is going *-2 to be turned *-3 into residential ghetto, you know,###speakerb24.###they're only going *-1 to suffer.###speakera25.
177255:17	and i think 0 probably it's pretty important right there.	probably	###they'd like *-1 to be able *-2 to get the top people in any field###and so they can almost always find room for someone like that.###at the bottom end, they, uh, are always willing *-1 to, uh, let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of * doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the, powerful people in that area.###speakerb20.###speakera21.###speakerb22.###speakera23.###those are two things that i think 0 *t*-1 are going on. although they, i, i don't think 0 the politicians would tell you that.###speakerb24.###okay###and i think 0 you're right in both cases.###speakera25.###and then the, third thing is, uh, the political aspect of, uh, uh, * letting steam come out from under the lid in mexico.###speakerb26.###speakera27.###they can not close off the mexican border. not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that *t*-1 would take place in mexico would be, uh, uh, would spill over to this country###speakerb28.###speakera29.###so they keep *-1 allowing, uh, the pressure cooker to let off steam.###speakerb30.
177302:17	i think, 0 probably your, a great deal of what you say *t*-1 is true about the legals.	probably	###uh, i mean it's, it is now with haitians the way 0 it was *t*-1 with cubans, uh, twenty years ago.###speakerb40.###well, i mean and the two of them together.###i mean we can,###it's just as well you know,###it's hardly america anymore.###speakera41.###on the other hand, you know, the ironic thing about this is that there's nobody more full of the entrepreneurial american spirit than our first generation immigrant.###so there's, uh, there's a lot 0 *t*-1 to be said *-4 for * having a steady stream of people who *t*-2 know how it is *t*-3 someplace else coming in.###speakerb42.###but there's some differences in the immigrants, that, that we're getting *t*-1 now.###speakera43.###speakerb44.###well i particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration.###speakera45.###right.###speakerb46.###speakera47.###sure.###speakerb48.
177341:41	of course, uh, you being from new mexico, you've probably been n-, to washington. especially if you're, your present location.	probably	###speakera2.###uh, around here we have a program where, uh, we, we put out the, the, we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers *t*-1.###and we keep the newspapers in a, in a,###they *ich*-5're collected *-6 twice a month and the trash and, and this bottled stuff that *t*-1 is put *-2 in a, in a little blue bin that *t*-3's picked *-4 up and sorted *-4 out into a truck.###so they ma-, actually have about three passes at this collection. one for the regular trash, one for the, uh, uh, you know, the bottles and cans and one for the newspapers.###speakerb3.###* sounds,###speakera4.###speakerb5.###but i gather 0 you do not separate, uh, the bottles and cans.###speakera6.###no,### they, they do that on the truck.###speakerb7.###uh-huh.###speakera8.###they separate them as they, as they, you know, dump them.###and, you know, one guy comes around with his truck and, and dumps it all in there.###and i think 0 they're, they're running out of, uh, you know, mumblex.###the sanitary landfill, i think 0 *t*-1, uh, is, you know, running out.
177401:14	well that's certainly, uh, you know, uh, getting into the swim of things.	certainly	###speakera24.###speakerb25.###and the thing that *t*-1 just was in the local news bulletin was, somebody has, uh, ter-, made some special, uh, polymers that *t*-2 have the ability * to, uh, make certain actinide elements adhere to them.###speakera26.###speakerb27.###uh, uh, they've, uh, looked at, uh, plutonium and uranium and, uh, some other similar things *-2 to try *-1 to remove those from radio active waste###speakera28.###huh.###speakerb29.###and, again, this is driven *-1 by all of the documentation and, uh, e s and h, uh, uh, considerations that, uh, people are, uh, worrying about *t*-2, i think, much more than they should *?*.###actually i've been involved *-1 in recycling for long before it became fashionable.###speakera30.###we-,###speakerb31.###back when i was in graduate school *t*-1, i did all of the recycling of the, uh, paper from the computer center###and, uh, in fact i think 0 i was the first person in our department 0 *t*-1 to have my thesis published *-2 on recyclable pa-, recycled paper.###speakera32.###huh.###speakerb33.###speakera34.
177421:46	uh, and, uh, and * limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than * limiting the weight.	probably	###well that's certainly, uh, you know, uh, getting into the swim of things.### i, i think 0 it should be, i-, it should go to the, to the heart of the matter though and say, okay guy,### you, y-, everybody gets, you know, five pounds of garbage that they can throw *t*-1 away, you know.###uh, but more than that every week, uh, you've got *-1 to pay by the pound.### i, i think i think 0 people would be, would get very, very, you know, they'd be very careful about how they bought stuff *t*-1.###speakerb35.###i think 0 that's a wonderful idea.###speakera36.###speakerb37.###the only alternative 0 i would see *t*-1 is, uh, and this would actually be a little more workable since * weighing everybody's garbage would be a real pain. uh, if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would, uh, speak more directly to the space needs and the landfill###speakera38.###uh-huh.###speakerb39.###and it would also cause people to compact their garbage more.###speakera40.###yeah.###speakerb41.###speakera42.###uh-huh.###speakerb43.
177423:82	well, of course, that, uh, you know, those big trucks can, can, probably are far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor.	probably	### you, y-, everybody gets, you know, five pounds of garbage that they can throw *t*-1 away, you know.###uh, but more than that every week, uh, you've got *-1 to pay by the pound.### i, i think i think 0 people would be, would get very, very, you know, they'd be very careful about how they bought stuff *t*-1.###speakerb35.###i think 0 that's a wonderful idea.###speakera36.###speakerb37.###the only alternative 0 i would see *t*-1 is, uh, and this would actually be a little more workable since * weighing everybody's garbage would be a real pain. uh, if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would, uh, speak more directly to the space needs and the landfill###speakera38.###uh-huh.###speakerb39.###and it would also cause people to compact their garbage more.###speakera40.###yeah.###speakerb41.###speakera42.###uh-huh.###speakerb43.###uh, and, uh, and * limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than * limiting the weight.###speakera44.
177485:94	i'm not, it's not something 0 i really enjoy *t*-1 all that much that, i'll, i'll probably,	probably	###huh.###speakera7.###and so, uh, you know, it's, e-, you know,###i need *-1 to get back into swimming, you know, instead of running.### if i can't swim or i can't run, i should be able *-1 to swim.###well i'm such a terrible swimmer###and i, i, i really feel 0 i can, i can dedicate about an hour, an hour and fifteen minutes f-, to this effort.###but if it gets longer than that i, i, i-, it, i start *-1 not doing anything.###speakerb8.###yeah.###speakera9.### and so, so i got a real problem in that regard.###uh, it,###do,###you obviously are, are not an exercise buff###or else you'd be out there *-1 doing it.###speakerb10.###yeah.###i mean, i do it, i guess 0 *t*-1,###i'm going *-1 to do it, uh, because i want *-2 to get in shape.
177656:58	i, i do do things, uh, that *t*-2 might be too crude 0 *t*-3 to be called *-1 woodworking.	might	###uh-huh.###speakera19.###speakerb20.###yeah.### i, i, uh, put together a, a, up rolltop desk from scratch.###speakera21.###oh, really?###speakerb22.###you know, a kit.###speakera23.###oh. i'm jealous.###speakerb24.###yeah.###* still had *-1 to cut it and everything,###but it was fun.###speakera25.###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###speakera27.###yeah.
177665:15	and, uh i definitely have begun *-1 to accumulate tools too.	definitely	###speakera23.###oh. i'm jealous.###speakerb24.###yeah.###* still had *-1 to cut it and everything,###but it was fun.###speakera25.###uh-huh.###speakerb26.###speakera27.###yeah.### i, i do do things, uh, that *t*-2 might be too crude 0 *t*-3 to be called *-1 woodworking.###i've built my own deck and, uh things like that.###speakerb28.###uh-huh.###speakera29.###speakerb30.###yeah.### i, i've done the same. you know, like the trim around the house you know the baseboards and things like that.###speakera31.
177693:27	and now i use it twice a year maybe.	maybe	###but i can't say 0 i use them very often.###speakerb36.###um. yeah###i'm looking at *-1 trying *-2 to get a router right now.###speakera37.### they're handy, uh, they they come in handy at the most unusual times.###speakerb38.###mumblex.###speakera39.###* putting doors in is the time when i'm,###uh, i bought myself a, uh, template for * making mortices and doors###and that's a whole lot easier than * doing it with a chisel.###speakerb40.###i'll bet.###speakera41.###but i've, also, i've also used them for * building drawers where you, uh, for rabbeting and, uh, because, uh, rabbeting on my table, on my, uh, radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain.###speakerb42.###uh-huh.###speakera43.###so, i got one for christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months 0 i had it *t*-1
177740:56	so the price of a good set of, uh, carbide steel, uh, bits is probably, uh, i mean, a, a good set of bits is probably going *-1 to run you a hundred dollars	probably	###speakera55.###uh, i have a, i'd guess 0 you'd call *rnr*-1 a medium quality craftsman router###and the, uh,###speakerb56.###how strong is it *t*-1?###speakera57.###it's strong enough for any job where you don't try *-1 to take more than say three-eighths of an inch at a time *t*-2.###but the problem is that the, uh, as with### any, any time 0 you buy a, a tool with a, a, as a, as a package *t*-1 the bits that they give you *t*-2 are low end.###speakerb58.###don't they,###speakera59.###speakerb60.###uh-huh.###speakera61.###speakerb62.###uh-huh.###speakera63.###speakerb64.###speakera65.
177740:111	so the price of a good set of, uh, carbide steel, uh, bits is probably, uh, i mean, a, a good set of bits is probably going *-1 to run you a hundred dollars	probably	###speakera55.###uh, i have a, i'd guess 0 you'd call *rnr*-1 a medium quality craftsman router###and the, uh,###speakerb56.###how strong is it *t*-1?###speakera57.###it's strong enough for any job where you don't try *-1 to take more than say three-eighths of an inch at a time *t*-2.###but the problem is that the, uh, as with### any, any time 0 you buy a, a tool with a, a, as a, as a package *t*-1 the bits that they give you *t*-2 are low end.###speakerb58.###don't they,###speakera59.###speakerb60.###uh-huh.###speakera61.###speakerb62.###uh-huh.###speakera63.###speakerb64.###speakera65.
