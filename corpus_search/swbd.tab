986:95	that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high *t*-1 because i would find that there be, cou-, a good possibly that their facts were, were fantasy.	possibly
992:10	and that might be the sense of the spending pattern *ich*-2, for instance, that, that i would have thought *t*-1 to be private.	might

1886:15	i think that probably what *t*-1 did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer.	probably
2184:35	and then we're also looking at it in *-1 possibly getting a mutual fund.	possibly
2298:35	but it is self improvement from the standpoint of * probably relaxing, uh.	probably
2321:14	and as you probably well know, all of us are our own customer.	probably
2333:15	well, uh, maybe i am into some things *ich*-1 occasionally that i don't think of *t*-2 in terms of self improvement.	maybe
2372:68	i think 0 if somebody would say hey, * read these ten books because these are self-improvements, i would probably be turned *-1 off to them.	probably
2377:78	if he casually just walked into it and, uh, put down a stephen king book and i picked up one of them i might be a little more interested.	might
2418:18	i need *-1 to probably make a phone call or two.	probably
2543:5	maybe you can call them split skirts.	maybe
2605:8	oh definitely.	definitely
2612:16	oh, it is definitely lined *-1 out.	definitely
2798:46	we have, we have gone through, what *t*-1 might be called *-2 the four seasons, uh, in the last week.	might

3841:15	i think 0 maybe we'll try *-1 to do that.	maybe
4116:43	it could be 0 t i --ers, i think 0 *t*-1, probably are participating more than anybody else,	probably
4174:149	uh, i, i think 0 what they are trying *-1 to say *t*-2, is that there is a great deal of historical truth, but 0 the interpretation that *t*-1 actually got into the writing of the bible itself is probably uh, after the what, uh, was is it *t*-2 the king james version when the committee did it, wrote the translation *t*-4, that so much was lost *-3 in the translation, particularly since most of the translations were in greek.	probably
4185:74	so, in, as to those types of interpretations, uh, really made a difference in how one might interpret the bible now *t*-1, and what it's at *t*-2.	might
4287:10	and i probably get more exercise than your average person.	probably
4440:9	and, maybe not,	maybe
4676:35	it's, uh, it's definitely,	definitely

4831:13	at least they might get some benefit in that,	might
5080:26	i don't have them all yet certainly.	certainly
5196:24	i've been doing it for probably ten years or so.	probably
5352:30	and they were saying that c n n is definitely a world, uh, news service	definitely
5374:45	i guess, 0 the news just focuses on major events that *t*-1 probably, don't affect ninety-nine percent of the people who *t*-2 are right there when the news is being made *-3 *t*-4.	probably
5658:63	so, so i mean, it's like this, this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people	probably
5733:8	i probably won't do it until i,	probably
5738:10	oh, probably be another twelve years.	probably
5756:43	they've, i think 0 they have maybe two people a year go *-1 get, get their p h d.	maybe
5832:130	i mean, like i say, if you're, if you're, you know, if you're at an upper level in the rank category, you know, you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year.	probably
5947:62	people generally go with that because they figure that the, you know, you probably won't get fired *-1 for *-2 getting i b m material.	probably
6184:30	and i think that, uh, we've probably got one of the best around, you know,	probably
6206:23	and i suspect that that's probably true for everyone.	probably
6232:13	and that's certainly one of the reasons that i'm sure 0 *t*-2 that they've begun the, uh, coda plan *t*-1.	certainly
6236:11	it's certainly a, a supplemental way,	certainly
6241:44	and i suppose 0 if, b-, maybe in, in your instance, if, if you're started *-1 with t i in your early to mid-twenties, and happen *-1 to stay with them until you're sixty-five, then you'll have a very good retirement plan.	maybe
6261:56	you know, one of the things that we're doing *t*-1 which *t*-2 is probably the worst investment in the world,	probably
6263:13	and it's probably not a great investment,	probably
6289:7	and maybe you don't start *-1 looking for that word guaranteed, until later.	maybe
6382:18	i think that i probably want *-1 to be a veterinarian.	probably
6409:50	uh, i can see some, some potential changes that *t*-1 probably are, are, would not cost very much but might, uh, make things a little easier. such as * offering a, a smorgasbord. having a larger variety of benefits	probably
6409:100	uh, i can see some, some potential changes that *t*-1 probably are, are, would not cost very much but might, uh, make things a little easier. such as * offering a, a smorgasbord. having a larger variety of benefits	might
6443:16	well, i could certainly, personally stand *-1 seeing them go to a, a standardized compensatory time for overtime.	certainly
6460:32	uh, and, and i would certainly support something like four to one or five to one	certainly
6461:33	or, or, you know, maybe they want *-1 to get generous and make it three to one.	maybe
6489:30	but, but then it's probably that way anywhere, you know,	probably
6509:34	or, you know, they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time	maybe
6534:12	i think possibly what, uh, they're thinking about *t*-1 here, more external peace corps, type things where we're sending people off shore *t*-3.	possibly
6545:51	if you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe countries that *t*-1 are so poor that they wouldn't be able *-2 to really, you know, send children to do that.	maybe
6585:14	but it *exp*-1 might be interesting * to see what *t*-2 would happen if you took kids at a, and then took then to another country instead of * having being exposed *-5 to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here, and take them to some other country that *t*-3 had different moral values, like saudi arabia where they couldn't drink *t*-4.	might
6589:8	you might end up with a revolution.	might
6635:17	people that *t*-1 might benefit most from it *ich*-4 might not go in that situation, you know, like people that *t*-2 really are trapped *-3 in a ghetto or something like that.	might
6635:35	people that *t*-1 might benefit most from it *ich*-4 might not go in that situation, you know, like people that *t*-2 really are trapped *-3 in a ghetto or something like that.	might
6680:11	it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have *t*-1 here and develop some pride in them, if it was handled *-2 that way.	certainly
6683:18	i think 0 it might build jobs for people, you know, that *t*-1 were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that,	might
6684:7	so maybe that part of it would be helpful too.	maybe
6898:80	well, um, with credit cards is, me, i, uh, i try *-1 to get maybe just one or two,	maybe
7376:18	i'd say 0 probably for maybe fifteen years, we dabbled in that, you know,	probably
7376:25	i'd say 0 probably for maybe fifteen years, we dabbled in that, you know,	maybe
7416:21	i know 0 it's probably late for you,	probably
7480:39	they're real liberal now and to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago, um, the democrat party being liberal like they are *?* now, you know, would never be thought of *-2 *t*-1,	probably
7546:15	you know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you know, like the no new taxes thing.	maybe
7555:21	i think 0 he can probably raise taxes and still get elected *-1.	probably
7568:14	unfortunately that will probably even drop lower, the voters turndown, mumblex even more because more democrats will think that they don't have a shot	probably
7643:34	well, i figured 0 with texas instruments they'd probably have a few, uh, texans on the line now and then.	probably
7665:24	and i thought, wow, that might be interesting.	might
7691:7	so maybe i'll figure it out.	maybe
8196:8	you probably don't want *t*-1 to take them *-2 to see silence of the lambs.	probably
8340:27	and, um, as we did with probably ninety-five percent of the people here in dallas-fort worth we bought a fox and jacobs home,	probably
8413:34	well, have you any plans * to, uh, maybe, uh, expand or move onward?	maybe
8418:20	and we had thought before maybe a lot older 0 we don't need such a large house that we'll sell it,	maybe
8523:52	so, the thing is, is basically that i spend, like, maybe thirty-five, forty dollars every two weeks on, on groceries	maybe
8696:11	we're probably like most am-, american families,	probably
8709:84	we've got a, several credit cards that sometimes, um, instead of *-1 paying *t*-2 them all off every month maybe you have *-1 to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around christmas time.	maybe
8787:22	and i spent around like, maybe, two hundred dollars.	maybe
9019:5	maybe it was because it was too dry,	maybe
9086:82	uh, robert what do you, uh, think, what substances do you think 0 *t*-1 are the most, uh, likely causes of air pollution?	likely
9169:10	uh, maybe just take good care of our cars, and make * sure 0 we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing.	maybe
9182:32	but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can, uh, force, uh, government, uh, that we elect *t*-1 to deal more seriously with it.	certainly
9205:13	and that's probably how we ought *-2 to do it *t*-1. uh, individ-, *-2 being individually responsible as, uh, gro-, in order *-3 to be group responsible.	probably
9212:32	and in the case of air pollution, it simply might turn out at some point down the road, *-1 to be so costly *ich*-4 *ich*-5 * to have *-3 to live with air pollution in terms of health problems, and everything else that we'll spend the money that *t*-6's necessary * to, uh, to get rid *-2 of the source of it.	might
9218:7	and probably the only way 0 that can happen *t*-1 is for, um, governments to realize that they have *-2 to pay if companies don't.	probably
9240:13	uh, i probably wouldn't mind if it really came down to it.	probably
9256:13	however, it might have had other causes.	might
9259:8	oh certainly,	certainly
9262:28	um, and i think 0 that's probably going *-1 to happen with, with such things as air pollution,	probably
9263:115	when we, when we se-, get serious about cleaning, about our motors in our automobiles *t*-2 then, uh, then maybe, you know, we'll have a little bit of help.	maybe
9287:7	and certainly we don't have the eye stinging variety that you get *t*-1 in the big cities.	certainly
9307:24	well i suspect that we've probably covered everything that we need *-1 to *?* *t*-2 here.	probably
9381:99	i mean, i'd, i would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly	possibly
9478:76	i, i think, 0 in, in some, in some respects it probably mumblex more tolerable.	probably
9481:97	well i guess 0 this, the weather isn't as lively a topic as, uh, as some of the others 0 we might have gotten *t*-1.	might
9512:16	well, my favorite, probably, all time t v show is star trek.	probably
9527:43	and i've, i've always liked that show probably the very best.	probably
9531:11	i'm certainly acquainted with the character the characters.	certainly
9639:4	maybe it's in,	maybe
9817:8	they probably didn't have a t v until i got *-1 to be, you know, grade school or so.	probably
9835:5	maybe even more so.	maybe
10120:8	we might actually get *-1 to go to a world series, huh.	might
10281:17	i've had him probably five years.	probably
10370:11	he's probably been through all kinds of nightmares.	probably
10468:30	and you go crazy *-1 thinking 0 it might be yours.	might
10531:23	and he said 0 he was probably weaned *-1 *-4 too young, which he was *t*-2, because his mom was killed *-3,	probably
10699:8	oh definitely.	definitely
10861:23	it, it might have one best picture, too.	might
10928:48	wel-, because that's the way 0 they, they might seem *t*-1 outwardly,	might
10943:90	and, and, and you need *-1 to, to work with it, uh, you know, certainly on, on a daily basis but then ag-, then again work with it toward a good end. not, not toward * winning in las vegas, for example.	certainly
10994:16	i mean he certainly didn't,	certainly
11344:13	you might, you don't have *-1 to pay them a lot.	might
11359:5	maybe there's two for aluminum.	maybe
11385:12	so, it probably is a hassle.	probably
11793:29	i mean, while it *exp*-1's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories, uh, pollute a lot, uh, if you look at how much pollution *t*-2 is say kicked *-3 up by an active volcano, uh, it *exp*-4's certainly less than clear that anything 0 man can do *t*-5 in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all.	certainly
11793:145	i mean, while it *exp*-1's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories, uh, pollute a lot, uh, if you look at how much pollution *t*-2 is say kicked *-3 up by an active volcano, uh, it *exp*-4's certainly less than clear that anything 0 man can do *t*-5 in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all.	certainly
11798:15	i think 0 probably the greatest cause is, uh, vehicles, especially around cities.	probably
11806:10	but i certainly work near a city.	certainly
11835:36	and, uh, i've noticed over the past say, maybe five or six years, uh,	maybe
12086:5	maybe you, you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe	maybe
12086:29	maybe you, you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe	probably
12097:10	so you probably would have *-1 to build it right into the muffler or something.	probably
12150:13	well you might, uh, generate some yeah, you might generate some interest in it.	might
12150:41	well you might, uh, generate some yeah, you might generate some interest in it.	might
12365:11	i'd certainly, uh,	certainly
12392:125	but i, i would imagine that because of the, how close the, the vote was *t*-1 i'm, uh, i mean * almost certainly would have *-2 to be *?*.	certainly
12442:46	well, had, had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor.	probably
12492:11	i'd certainly, uh, support israel in, in their, their policy that in * defending themselves and in, uh, in their handling of their foreign policy,	certainly
12566:25	i guess, uh, well 0 maybe the computer will pair us up together another time.	maybe
12962:15	i guess 0 probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is, uh, probably eddy arnold.	probably
12962:50	i guess 0 probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is, uh, probably eddy arnold.	probably
13194:15	i think 0 probably as soon as they finished high school it would be ideal, because a lot of times, i-, if they go straight into college i think 0 they're going in too quick	probably
13325:42	*-1 being a professional and, of course, you probably belong to one or more professional organizations,	probably
13435:29	and i'm just assuming 0 it's probably a salesman that *t*-1 called during the day	probably
13437:13	and they'll probably call me up and, you know, call me back and bother me when i sit down to dinner later on *t*-1,	probably
13473:8	i might get an important phone call,	might
13546:16	well, yours is probably the same as ours.	probably
13605:31	oh, dana, i think 0 we have probably conversed long enough.	probably
13710:81	* to be, you know, * not to be crass about it, but, uh, uh, whether one might conceive, no pun intended, of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate, uh, uh a professional mother, a-, person. for instance, that,	might
13710:116	* to be, you know, * not to be crass about it, but, uh, uh, whether one might conceive, no pun intended, of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate, uh, uh a professional mother, a-, person. for instance, that,	might
13759:187	uh, i know that there are young people, characterized *, i guess as * being half my age, so that by definition that means, 0 they're young. uh, that, in my work place, who *t*-3 are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably *-4 would consider *-5 paying a woman, uh, eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year *-1 to take care of their child,	probably
13789:13	and then you might have more control over, uh, the, the morals that they would be taught *-1 *t*-2 rather than in like a classroom or a day care center.	might
13854:12	uh, and maybe that's a change 0 we'll see *t*-1.	maybe
13999:36	and, uh, hopefully, we'll have other good topic maybe another call someday,	maybe
14061:67	and * a-, as expensive as they are *?* 0 * to produce *t*-1, they certainly don't want any dead airspace.	certainly
14071:47	i, wo-, i, we're certainly in agreement there.	certainly
14076:21	they're, maybe they're a little more efficient, or have more 0 * to do *t*-1 over that same time frame.	maybe
14088:20	but i don't anymore, maybe once or twice a year.	maybe
14166:87	i wondered if it would help 0 you sometimes fill in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that other people, people like myself might not pick up on *t*-1.	might
14168:50	well, i, i think, uh, 0 my background is probably what *t*-1 absolutely turned me off with sixty minutes.	probably
14194:16	and there's maybe a page of that, little brief paragraphs, unless that was one of their, the focus of their main stories.	maybe
14255:5	maybe our phone company out here will get around to, *-1 offering something like that.	maybe
14259:27	so, that is something 0 you might keep your eyes open for *t*-1,	might
14404:20	i think 0 the cowboys probably have a, a better team.	probably
14456:5	maybe i'll call you back after, after the recording is finished *-1.	maybe
14523:15	i guess 0 probably since about eighty-four, about eighty-five was when they started *-1 kind of going downhill really *t*-2,	probably
14575:7	so maybe this year mumblex.	maybe
14692:10	and that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased *t*-1.	certainly
14704:65	i mean, the thing is is that, you know, it's like you might be standing somewhere, right,	might
14774:24	of course, i mean i might be, you know, the the leading drug dealer here,	might
14815:4	might.	might
15040:7	and maybe we'll get *-1 to talk again.	maybe
15070:11	it's definitely up to the person, uh,	definitely
15122:46	or, so you're looking at the peace corps or sabbatical maybe,	maybe
15140:13	i couldn't possibly commit a year or two of my life *-1 to, to go *-2 do something.	possibly
15161:11	i'd probably catch a terrible disease and die.	probably
15172:16	i think that maybe that's why some people do it *t*-1 is, uh, * to see the other cultures or, you know and some of that.	maybe
15212:30	and the peace corps or something like that is probably useful as, as that kind of a time.	probably
15215:5	maybe a little bit in that perspective,	maybe
15225:11	i'd probably have a different perspective if i actually knew someone that *t*-1 had gone into the peace corps.	probably
15257:8	i certainly didn't mark off anything *-1 to get this one.	certainly
15275:11	oh, probably five or six.	probably
15281:20	oh, i've done maybe four or five.	maybe
15382:13	and you've probably never gardened in your life mumblex.	probably
15514:50	and they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more probably * to age, to age the material	probably
15664:12	so, it might not be as,	might
15774:21	i think 0 that's probably true, too.	probably
15795:20	i think that probably, i think 0 most companies now, as far as entry, you know, exams require that.	probably
15941:29	well, well i'm definitely for it.	definitely
15980:132	so i think 0 some place, you know, places like that, it should be like mandatory like, you know, on, on a, on a greater frequency than maybe, just, you know, paper pushers like, like i am *?*.	maybe
16095:5	maybe a recipe,	maybe
16102:9	maybe, maybe we're all set.	maybe
16102:17	maybe, maybe we're all set.	maybe
16154:10	oh, definitely.	definitely
16213:12	you probably get this, probably pretty sticky after you get done.	probably
16213:36	you probably get this, probably pretty sticky after you get done.	probably
16298:42	i mean, no matter how careful you are *t*-1 you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot.	might
16343:24	when it thickens *t*-1 the cornstarch might get a little, i don't know,	might
16352:21	you'd have *-1 to probably almost go out	probably
16435:11	it would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good.	probably
16435:31	it would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good.	probably
16486:10	and i might put it back on.	might
16493:59	after, well when it starts *-1 steaming a lot *t*-2, uh, i definitely, yeah, put it in the refrigerator,	definitely
16853:11	that'd probably be pretty interesting.	probably
16911:13	but there's probably something else that *t*-1 might make you *?*.	probably
16911:31	but there's probably something else that *t*-1 might make you *?*.	might
16917:32	but, uh, they, they might weed you out some other way.	might
17638:46	i get into that for, for a little while and maybe go out, uh, on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile,	maybe
17639:40	but then i'll get tired of *-1 doing that, and maybe start *-1 jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week.	maybe
17977:13	well, they certainly are living off our ex-, at our expense.	certainly
18215:31	and i, i certainly, i, i grew up in a smaller town in texas,	certainly
18242:16	well, we're probably fixing *-1 to run out of time pretty, soon,	probably
18344:45	we've, we've got mayb-, maybe eight to eight inches to a foot of soil,	maybe
18834:12	uh, maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things *t*-1.	maybe
19309:5	maybe they're finally waking up and saying, you know, we can't afford this.	maybe
19334:52	and, you know, i even had a thought *ich*-2 once that the whole iraqi thing might have been just a, a deal *-1 to go ahead and let us, uh, you know, expend some, some military hardware.	might
19387:38	mumblex personally i don't see as gorbachev as *-1 being maybe a threat,	maybe
19437:38	it *exp*-2's easy * to believe that they were probably more *ich*-4 forced *-3 into a pact than, uh, a volunteer or willingness * to join.	probably
19473:7	and maybe, you know, more and more people are seeing, oh, countries hopefully are seeing that that buffer isn't going *-1 to help you,	maybe
19496:11	that's probably very true.	probably
19773:8	they might as well have not even been there.	might
19856:16	and then i had probably lived the last eleven years in massachusetts	probably
19966:68	see, i had never really been into science fiction that much until, uh, somebody gave me mist of avalon probably about five or six years ago.	probably
19997:25	and, i think 0 that's probably my favorite of, of any piece of science fiction that i've ever read *t*-1.	probably
20027:44	*-2 even having read the book, and i've read that book probably three times, *-2 watching that movie, i couldn't figure out, what they were talking about *t*-1, at all.	probably
20257:16	um, we're probably one of the, the only countries in the world that *t*-1 has all the things that we have *t*-2.	probably
20350:15	i thought 0 maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there.	maybe
20471:13	so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get *t*-1 back.	definitely
20542:39	that's what we're looking at *t*-1, fifteen or maybe twenty.	maybe
21121:8	this might age me, date me here,	might
21128:21	well, see, you're probably about the same age as me because my mom watched the secret storm, and the edge of night.	probably
21302:33	i think 0 it adds a, probably adds a little bit of depth to his character.	probably
21413:7	and maybe that's what the public wants *t*-1,	maybe
21452:5	maybe it's not a good example.	maybe
21511:16	unfortunately, that's probably true.	probably
21903:18	i mean, you might have problems,	might
21984:53	i mean, it's like, if you plan a year ahead, you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know, one thousand four hundred dollars * to send your child to college, you know.	probably
22048:8	well maybe something will open up for you.	maybe
22194:84	and it seems that * the younger 0 you can get them and get them involved *-1 with programs after school *-3 *t*-2, you might keep them	might
22226:8	they might have five hundred troubled youths.	might
22274:10	the parents might be thirty years old	might
22329:10	the parents might have hostilities towards them, you know, like you're judging us,	might
22349:10	and i might see it on a, you know, a sixty minutes special.	might
22405:8	someone might grab you, mess around with you,	might
22479:109	so, i have not done, uh, much freshwater fishing oh, for, you know, lake, lake fishing for bass and so forth but, uh, maybe some what they call *t*-1 brim and those sorts of things, but nothing,	maybe
22645:10	just hoping maybe, 0 he could pull.	maybe
22692:21	so, we thought well, maybe there are some crab in here,	maybe
22756:43	i guess 0 the largest one 0 i ever caught *t*-1 was probably eight or ten inches long,	probably
22782:53	and the first thing 0 i caught *t*-1 was a sand shark, which *t*-2 was probably a foot, and a half or, uh, two feet long,	probably
22835:29	but, um, we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted *-1 to give him some medication * to sort of, you know keep him real out of it all the time	maybe
23081:8	that might be kind of tough, huh.	might
23136:20	so i figured 0 i might get me one of those because we don't always read the newspaper.	might
23216:61	but, you know, for other kind of cans, just to, it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that, don't they.	probably
23230:11	you could probably just, you know,	probably
23264:24	i'm sure 0 they're probably doing that here some.	probably
23320:11	it's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere.	probably
23467:79	well, i think, i think 0 basically we're in a lot of agreement, uh, in that i certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs, uh, some kind of legal definition.	certainly
23467:118	well, i think, i think 0 basically we're in a lot of agreement, uh, in that i certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs, uh, some kind of legal definition.	maybe
23471:32	but for anything involving that, trial by jury certainly should be mandatory.	certainly
23477:5	maybe there ought *-1 to be some kind of, of, uh, mumblex	maybe
23483:7	and maybe instead of, of, uh, * just kind of blowing it off just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do, maybe we should commit *-1 to spend a week,	maybe
23483:98	and maybe instead of, of, uh, * just kind of blowing it off just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do, maybe we should commit *-1 to spend a week,	maybe
23523:43	and although we supporting a whole segment of society called * lawyers, maybe we don't need *-1 to do that.	maybe
23530:15	you know, maybe, instead of * being so quick *-1 to sue you, uh, if you have a disagreement with someone, instead of * tying up court and time and that kind of stuff, maybe you nee-, maybe you,	maybe
23530:125	you know, maybe, instead of * being so quick *-1 to sue you, uh, if you have a disagreement with someone, instead of * tying up court and time and that kind of stuff, maybe you nee-, maybe you,	maybe
23530:149	you know, maybe, instead of * being so quick *-1 to sue you, uh, if you have a disagreement with someone, instead of * tying up court and time and that kind of stuff, maybe you nee-, maybe you,	maybe
23801:10	your parents might remember if they were here then.	might
24005:82	but if you're serving another dish with it, * say the rice dish um, well, with guys pretty healthy appetites, i'd probably go a third of a pound	probably
24012:11	i could probably go half a pound.	probably
24049:21	i thought 0 it was maybe like, you know, like five fifty or something.	maybe
24218:11	that's probably very useful.	probably
24252:17	maybe, maybe * being a tenured professor would be one thing,	maybe
24281:20	probably, you probably got everybody on you, because they were probably all going to law school.	probably
24281:50	probably, you probably got everybody on you, because they were probably all going to law school.	probably
24338:53	it's i, i think 0 it's probably more embarrassing and very painful.	probably
24379:32	and i, i think 0 probably the biggest.	probably
24421:30	i, i thought 0 maybe you might have had some experience with the, uh, r c one thirty-fives.	maybe
24421:36	i, i thought 0 maybe you might have had some experience with the, uh, r c one thirty-fives.	might
24517:8	i definitely think 0 they should be tested *-1.	definitely
24519:30	i mean because i know 0 i certainly wouldn't want *-1 to, to, uh, you know, be endangered *-2 by somebody in a company that *t*-3 accidentally dropped something on me or, or you know, because he was on drugs while he was there.	certainly
24549:14	and that's probably my question is, how, how do you know 0 it's done *-1 fairly *t*-2.	probably
24558:13	well, they might tell you 0 it's random.	might
24596:20	but i think 0 that might be a violation of someone's rights.	might
24641:99	well, does your r-, does your job require you to drive company equipment or to ap-, operate any type of machinery that *t*-1 might endanger someone?	might
24883:21	and, or maybe they're unemployed	maybe
24916:8	that might not turn around in the next, you know, fifteen, twenty years.	might
24919:10	maybe the, maybe they'll bring their good schools with them. you know,	maybe
24919:21	maybe the, maybe they'll bring their good schools with them. you know,	maybe
24929:51	they're, they're, you're most likely *-1 to do better in school.	likely
24991:5	maybe we do, we need some more catholic schools,	maybe
25092:11	it's probably not as accurate,	probably
25093:5	probably, you know, * intellectually doesn't,	probably
25140:16	but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population they don't have any college probably much at all	probably
25140:56	but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population they don't have any college probably much at all	probably
25144:101	and if we can't take it and use it easily, well, how can you put that on, like, elderly people and you know, just people that *t*-1 maybe just aren't blessed with as, as much sharpness and ment-, mental acuity *t*-2,	maybe
25336:8	that probably is a little bit under what it is *t*-1 for this time of year.	probably
25343:13	but you're probably right.	probably
25347:51	well, i like it when it's sort of a medium temperature, uh, maybe seventy-five to eighty, somewhere in there *t*-1.	maybe
25360:11	you're probably right.	probably
25398:28	it, uh, it probably was a lot warmer up high.	probably
25507:31	and, uh, i think 0 that's probably going *-1 to be one of the next investments, is * get her, get her a set of clubs	probably
25551:48	i guess, 0 the first time 0 i played golf *t*-1 has been probably about eight or ten years ago now, when i was in college *t*-2.	probably
25562:38	um, well, * have, have probably like, like a thursday night bachelor party and a friday golf day before the wedding.	probably
25690:115	but, uh, i'd like *-1 to, uh, eventually i'd like *-2 to work up, if, if my wife does get interested, and maybe get involved in a league in a, in a mixed, mixed doubles league, or something like that.	maybe
25752:20	but, she'll definitely, uh, she'll make the trip for fishing if that comes along,	definitely
26082:25	oh, my husband says 0 i might buy it,	might
26161:10	or you probably have something similar.	probably
26279:8	they might be *?*,	might
26301:8	i probably won't finish it until the end of the year	probably
26379:67	but even though i love the car 0 i've got *t*-1 now, i think 0 my next car will probably be american again because if i can at all do it, i'd like *-2 to stay american,	probably
26443:31	and i would, i probably, if i had thought 0 i, uh, wanted *-1 to pay the amount of money, i probably would have gone with, uh, uh, an accord or even a, a civic, or something comparable from nissan or toyota,	probably
26443:99	and i would, i probably, if i had thought 0 i, uh, wanted *-1 to pay the amount of money, i probably would have gone with, uh, uh, an accord or even a, a civic, or something comparable from nissan or toyota,	probably
26477:25	and i, i probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start *-1 looking around again,	probably
26477:53	and i, i probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start *-1 looking around again,	probably
26488:37	but, uh, i don't have any plans *ich*-1 for probably another two, three years of *-2 even looking, you know.	probably
26536:16	that doesn't seem likely.	likely
26616:18	i think that it probably would be a, a good program.	probably
26617:15	i think 0 probably two years is too long.	probably
26621:15	i think 0 maybe a year would be, the longest.	maybe
26627:23	you're prob-, probably right,	probably
26628:10	two years might be a little too long.	might
26650:7	or maybe * offer them, you know, some sort of an incentive * to do it. uh, you know college credit, you know, something, you know,	maybe
26671:8	they probably couldn't do anything monetary,	probably
26737:8	they might,	might
26743:64	and that's the other thing is that, you know, instead of *-1 making it mandatory, they maybe need *-1 to publicize it a little bit better. and, uh, you know, go to the schools and do programs, and tell them that we need your help, and, you know, uh, * volunteer for such and such a time,	maybe
26760:59	and, and that way, *-1 handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it.	probably
26763:8	like maybe if, if there was something 0 they could do *t*-1 in their own, own, in their own town or city, yeah, and not have *-2 to pull up roots and, you know, go somewhere half way around the world, or something.	maybe
26772:15	most of them probably wouldn't do something like that. although there are a lot of kids who *t*-1 would do it *-2 just to get away from their parents.	probably
26840:39	and you, you give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something,	maybe
26968:8	i maybe should have taken the higher grades because at least you can, if you have *-1 to *?* you can get mean with them.	maybe
27068:33	but we felt like, you know, * maybe just going ahead and * try *-3 to teaching them was bet-, trying *-2 to teach them was better than * have them taken *-1 out.	maybe
27135:25	but there, there definitely needs *-1 to be a balance somewhere.	definitely
27346:7	and maybe they were a group of mennonites or something like that.	maybe
27674:14	well, maybe, maybe that *t*-1 understands colors would know all of that stuff	maybe
27674:22	well, maybe, maybe that *t*-1 understands colors would know all of that stuff	maybe
27716:50	it kind of bled under the masking tape which, i guess, *t*-1 is probably the topic 0 we're we're really on to *t*-2 that, that the masking is,	probably
27772:10	so we probably have an in-, interesting perspective on the music on the times,	probably
27821:44	and i've developed a real love for, uh, classical music in, probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was, uh, heavy into classical type music.	probably
27857:29	i'm kind of thinking 0 that's maybe,	maybe
27876:91	uh, and my family now knows 0 if they come into my study and, uh, i happen *-1 to have had a tough day at work and maybe i'm trying *-2 to get a project done, uh, at school, uh, and i'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to downtown they know *-3 to just stay away,	maybe
27890:10	uh, probably about first grade,	probably
27944:5	maybe one of these days, i'll, you know,	maybe
27946:5	maybe one of these days i'll get around to it,	maybe
27948:7	but probably not.	probably
27983:47	if you were educated you got, you know, you might teach for a year or two before you got married *-1.	might
27997:89	there was not, there's not supposed *-1 to be any reason 0 * to use this education or this brain that you might have *t*-2 for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the bathroom floors be *t*-3 on any given day *t*-4.	might
28013:41	but but, uh, a really good day care is probably going *-1 to cost more than you're going *-2 to make at the job.	probably
28049:5	maybe if you get along	maybe
28054:8	* might have been better.	might
28139:64	because if, if i had been allowed *-1 to work, you know, maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week, i might still be working basically full time or part time, if there was, if there had been some way 0 *-3 to work it out *t*-2,	maybe
28139:97	because if, if i had been allowed *-1 to work, you know, maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week, i might still be working basically full time or part time, if there was, if there had been some way 0 *-3 to work it out *t*-2,	might
28228:12	and a man might say out loud, well, you know, i understand this	might
28239:68	most of the men don't walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that yes, you probably ought *-1 to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it.	probably
28367:108	but i think 0 if we can, if we can expand the men's roles at the same time, like you're taking care of your child, and your dad probably didn't very often	probably
28482:42	if i had a machine already installed * at home i would probably work just about every night.	probably
28817:10	and you probably do.	probably
29024:61	i mean, uh, * to add dependents is, is you know, maybe another dollar or something	maybe
29078:27	if you're in richardson you'd probably wanted *-1 to come to the, to the dallas site.	probably
29087:13	and you'd probably like the pool there.	probably
29090:8	i might do that then.	might
29227:8	we might have us a problem.	might
29246:17	but, we'll, maybe do our small part * to fix them up.	maybe
29296:44	i normally find that uh, i-, i'm probably the most, um, news hungry of my friends,	probably
29323:10	and he definitely has a very different slant on the news.	definitely
29343:22	i understand that the macneil lehrer probably doesn't.	probably
29349:16	they will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time.	maybe
29473:7	and probably more importantly, one that *t*-1 lasted short enough that, that people's interest didn't flag too badly.	probably
29571:32	and my, my fiancee takes probably six sunday papers.	probably
29586:33	um, i guess, um, 0 this is probably really a good subject for me because i really like *-1 to do, uh, hand work.	probably
29627:29	that, that would be definitely something 0 you'd want *-1 to keep *t*-2.	definitely
29694:11	i've probably seen it, though,	probably
29757:10	oh, definitely,	definitely
29823:8	you definitely don't have time.	definitely
29893:11	i'm probably going *-1 to hear about it the rest of my life.	probably
30023:56	and, uh, so we'll pay a little interest *ich*-1 this year, but maybe two dollars.	maybe
30127:76	if it were, say sixty or seventy francs a night that would mean 0 it would be about ten dollars or so, or maybe twenty dolls-,	maybe
30131:5	maybe it would be more than that.	maybe
30302:11	it's probably pretty close to what i have *t*-1, because i have the same kind of thing at work.	probably
30370:10	oh, definitely,	definitely
30371:4	definitely.	definitely
30372:60	i know 0 my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer, oh, i guess *rnr*-1, probably three years ago for christmas,	probably
30428:21	there are some definitely, some, some advantages to it.	definitely
30496:10	and they probably used *-1 to have it.	probably
30548:25	i continued *-1 working there for probably another year.	probably
30566:11	that's probably one of the problems and frustrations that it's brought *t*-1 about, because people do feel like, oh well, we can just change it.	probably
30614:19	so. anyway, maybe, you know, maybe it'll, it'll help in some way,	maybe
30614:37	so. anyway, maybe, you know, maybe it'll, it'll help in some way,	maybe
30616:24	there, there definitely even with the few disadvantages like that are far better than the alternative.	definitely
31039:36	i guess 0 they, they'll probably come out with a lot of movies, you know.	probably
31042:8	they probably do the story of someone who *t*-1 was shot *-2 down early in the war or something and how he survived *t*-3 or, or about, or about those two newsmen or whatever that *t*-4 got captured *-5.	probably
31062:26	well, i think 0 we've probably,	probably
31188:15	some of those certainly have a lot of dis-, difficulties, you know, with, uh, all sorts of things,	certainly
31208:78	are the rest of us who *t*-1 went for the big bucks, you know, staying out of, you know, where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated *-2 to spend some time *-4 teaching or something with these kids *t*-3?	maybe
31263:31	you're telling them that, hey, you might as well forget it, you know.	might
31323:13	otherwise, he might have been driving trucks or framing houses, you know, from here to eternity.	might
31362:38	that's, of course, that is certainly true,	certainly
31414:37	i agree that, that some innocent person might be victimized *-1, by a false test,	might
31419:81	for example, that one, uh, positive would not be, uh, accepted *-1 as an automatic, um, reason for whatever they might be going, *-2 to do *t*-6 if they found a positive, uh, dismissal or treatment or whatever, but that, that what it would do *t*-3 is it would trigger, perhaps, uh, one or two more stages where further tests could be ta-, uh, done *-4 *t*-5.	might
31427:38	on the other hand, um, i think 0 there's certainly some professions that *t*-1 ought *-2 to be tested *-3 because of the, of their responsibility for the public welfare, and certainly people in, uh, industries, well, the transportation industry, for spe-, uh, you know, specifically.	certainly
31427:117	on the other hand, um, i think 0 there's certainly some professions that *t*-1 ought *-2 to be tested *-3 because of the, of their responsibility for the public welfare, and certainly people in, uh, industries, well, the transportation industry, for spe-, uh, you know, specifically.	certainly
31437:179	but, um, in many, many cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs, it's not even going *-1 to effect anybody but his, uh, you know, himself and his own family, perhaps, um, depending on the kind of drug 0 he might be on *t*-2.	might
31542:211	well, the limits, uh, uh, would, i think 0 *t*-5, have *-3 to do with what i'd alluded to *t*-1 before, that there needs *-6 to be a further, um, that, that one positive on a drug test, would not constitute, uh, dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might, uh, have *t*-4 set up for those who *t*-2 genuinely have a problem.	might
31570:63	and people who *t*-1 are on medication, for example, or, um, even people who *t*-2 might be of the gay community,	might
31596:7	but certainly random testing, the fact that people know that, that they,	certainly
31739:8	you might put them in the ground just the first week of june	might
31806:42	i'm, just wrote my resume up because told 0 we might be facing layoff over at digital	might
32295:39	i guess 0 it, it, might would *?*,	might
32597:46	and i'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe i won't have, oh, i'll have less of a bug problem	maybe
32697:8	it might be handy,	might
33017:31	well, um, i think 0 it would probably depend on whether this was a formal *rnr*-1 or a informal *rnr*-1 dinner party.	probably
33031:32	but if it was a formal dinner party i would probably think of something else like, uh,	probably
33102:68	but, um, if it was more formal like if i was, you know, working environment then i would probably, um, sh-, shell'em or at least disconnect them from the head.	probably
33209:97	and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be ethnic food or um sometimes it would be um oh oh i don't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh elegant theme or you know	maybe
33215:11	sometimes it might be the candlelight	might
33216:13	and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something	might
33241:27	except that * knowing them they would probably do something ridiculous and terrible just just *-1 to uh make * sure that they didn't have *-2 to do it again	probably
33365:4	probably you have *-1 to heat it up for a good oh	probably
33686:11	that's probably the safer way	probably
33727:31	and at first after it happened i thought, maybe that's a handicap access,	maybe
33799:5	maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being.	maybe
33837:23	i've been there like, maybe a dozen times.	maybe
33867:15	i thought 0 maybe one of these days i'll drive over there and check it out.	maybe
33893:50	but he, he kind of said something *ich*-1 to me about probably not as bad as your foot,	probably
33894:25	but he just said to me, maybe you ought *-1 to try bicycling	maybe
33898:8	you probably will *?* for a while, because it's going *-1 to be real tender.	probably
33962:18	uh, the ammunition is probably so old 0 i'm afraid *-1 to use it.	probably
33981:34	and like you, my bullets to my little pistol's probably, uh, about three years old.	probably
34010:180	i think, you know, 0 one of the things that, that, that *t*-1 needs *-2 to happen is, uh, * to, to stop the impulse buyer from, uh, *-3 buying it quickly and, and, uh, maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it.	maybe
34251:83	bu-, bu-, you know, they know so, how much money *ich*-2 you make *t*-1 a week to, uh, probably your, uh,	probably
34264:23	they, they probably know everything from *ich*-2, half the time wh-, ho-, what time you go to the bathroom *t*-1.	probably
34266:8	they probably do.	probably
34331:35	i'm s-, i shouldn't probably say control.	probably
34605:5	maybe it's just the idea of my reaction to the first time.	maybe
34615:7	and maybe i just laughed so hard *ich*-1 the first time that i didn't have it,	maybe
34624:5	maybe so.	maybe
34918:7	so probably everything 0 i going *-1 to say *t*-2 is kind of dated.	probably
35060:18	none of it's probably damaging, lot of times.	probably
35149:47	if half of the time wasn't spent *-1 * watching commercials, it probably wouldn't be so bad.	probably
35418:33	and then the cadillac is, is definitely a used car	definitely
35426:21	he says 0 it'll probably be gone in a done,	probably
35427:13	and it's probably gone by now.	probably
35451:40	or do i look for a used car that *t*-1's maybe two, three years old that but that *t*-2's, you know, low mileage and in good shape.	maybe
35577:39	because one of these days i'll be getting a six seater probably too.	probably
35651:11	that's probably the best thing.	probably
35655:7	or maybe more than that, as i've learned.	maybe
35684:19	and i think, 0 maybe, as you get outside the dallas area,	maybe
35687:10	well, maybe because it's outside of dallas they are giving a little bit better prices,	maybe
35761:23	and i'm sure 0 he probably knew what *t*-1 was going on the very next day	probably
35989:32	and, and there's probably, there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent * on the bureaucracy.	probably
35989:51	and, and there's probably, there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent * on the bureaucracy.	probably
36092:49	i think that if, uh, young people had service to the country * might give them more ambition. because they learn that * serving other people is a good thing.	might
36139:32	that was a lot, that's probably the most fun 0 i had *t*-1.	probably
36480:20	maybe it, maybe it speeded up the process and all that.	maybe
36783:5	maybe in the backyard,	maybe
36784:35	but i don't see *-1 going on a camping trip probably until next summer.	probably
37032:11	that's probably more true than, a lot of people realize.	probably
37063:5	probably not enough,	probably
37127:30	this is, this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female.	probably
37129:21	i was afraid 0 we might get into an argument.	might
37133:39	well, uh, i guess uh, 0 there have been certainly a lot of changes *ich*-1 in the last couple of generations, for, uh, the roles of women	certainly
37137:30	and uh, i guess 0 the most significant probably is that so many are working now, and trying *-1 to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities, you know,	probably
37268:26	that, that's definitely true.	definitely
37401:70	eve-, every once in a while, i will keep in, in touch, with maybe, like who *t*-1's in the top five of hitting, or something like that	maybe
37503:58	but i mean if you can't do it with men on base, there's something definitely wrong, um, you know,	definitely
37530:37	and they're, uh, they're certainly intense about the cardinals	certainly
37569:23	i, i definitely do,	definitely
37580:68	but if they were, uh, playing the people that they're going *-1 to play *t*-2, then that might be pretty good indication,	might
37635:16	um, that's probably true.	probably
37668:41	well and that, i think 0 that's maybe part of it that, that the, um,	maybe
37684:95	and, uh, you know, i mean, i, i guess 0 as we get older, i-, you're probably going,	probably
37695:75	an i, i, i would, i would think 0 baseball probably feeds on a number of people that *t*-1 can go out there, you know, several times a,	probably
37753:49	and, you know, and they're being paid *-1, probably half what most people being paid *-2 *t*-3.	probably
37841:20	but, uh, i can definitely, uh, see 0 on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age *t*-1, that's going *-2 to be a definite concern.	definitely
37865:118	and, you know, that's going * to, that's going *-4 to affect the people that *t*-1 are having kids in school, of course, which *t*-2 is probably the only fair thing 0 * to do *t*-3.	probably
37869:124	and, you know, it's going *-1 to really hurt the, the middle class, uh, people, i think 0 *t*-4. because, uh, they're the ones that *t*-2 will probably have *-3 to, to carry the brunt of the load.	probably
37956:17	i, maybe i'm wrong, because i haven't, you know, been in that kind of environment for a long time,	maybe
38155:31	so. everything's changed so much 0 i probably couldn't even get a job right now.	probably
38311:8	you probably use mumblex or something like that, for your, uh, data entry stuff that you're, talking about *t*-1.	probably
38412:11	i've maybe been into the office once in the past three years, you know.	maybe
38481:22	i read quite a bit, probably don't read as much as i would like *-1 to *?*.	probably
38506:24	uh, the road less travelled was probably one of my favorites.	probably
38527:13	well, um probably the best one that i, i know of *t*-1 and i work with *t*-1 all the time is called *-2 search for significance by robert mcgee	probably
38535:11	it's probably one 0 you'd find *t*-1 in like a christian book store.	probably
38545:10	um, probably * should stay on the topic,	probably
38823:24	i'd say 0 reading is probably one of my biggest ones, because it's the type of thing that you can, you can do *t*-1 a little bit at a time, whereas,	probably
38936:23	and it was about fifteen by twenty maybe.	maybe
39022:23	but i think 0 we're probably past that now.	probably
39023:8	i probably should go *-1 buy some.	probably
39027:33	i guess 0 if i had a house i might enjoy gardening, some.	might
39066:16	and so that's probably my problem there.	probably
39084:58	and i'd, i think 0 when i was real little *t*-1 i probably had a finger in on that every time 0 he did it *t*-2 and had *-3 to be out there and watch and that type of stuff.	probably
39150:19	and we thought, well maybe when they're a little bit bigger *t*-1 then we'll,	maybe
39179:40	if we were going *-1 to get anything now it would definitely be a cat, or even a bird or a fish tank or something, you know. something small	definitely
39190:65	because, you kind of, even, even a cat, you never know when they might bite or scratch or something *t*-1.	might
39194:17	they're not as likely *-2 to *?* as a dog might *?*, i guess 0 *t*-1.	likely
39194:39	they're not as likely *-2 to *?* as a dog might *?*, i guess 0 *t*-1.	might
39202:37	and if i was a cat or dog, i'd respond probably by *-1 biting or something.	probably
39208:27	but, well, i think 0 we probably reached our time limit.	probably
39214:4	probably	probably
39558:8	we might try *-1 to, to, um, to grill some flounder or salmon steaks.	might
39571:15	and, um, definitely go with, it will have *-1 to be a rice dish lots of vegetables, * to make up for the lack of meat.	definitely
39636:11	i'll might have *-1 to visit the state book store.	might
39894:21	and, and maybe they were *?*,	maybe
39962:52	i think, i think 0 that, that probably was the difference in that game.	probably
40027:20	one of those two will probably be, um, in there,	probably
40043:17	so, uh, that might help them.	might
40145:13	well, that might have been what it was *t*-1,	might
40149:17	i, maybe i misunderstood what they meant *t*-1.	maybe
40308:48	i'm kind of had different, different ideas from what probably the majority of people have *t*-1,	probably
40493:126	and, uh, when school lets out *t*-1, i just don't, i haven't, i have no idea what i'm going *-2 to do *t*-3, because i certainly can't afford what we did *t*-4 last year which *t*-5 was,	certainly
41103:8	everybody might not like that.	might
41220:63	and then, every time 0 you wanted *-1 to go *-2 eat with somebody *t*-3, you'd probably have *-4 to go to out, *-5 eat or something.	probably
41587:34	so. it, it, uh, definitely fluctuates mainly with what i'm going *-1 to be doing *t*-2 that day and kind of what my mood is *t*-3	definitely
41591:34	and when it's raining *t*-1, i'm more likely *-2 to wear jeans	likely
41594:48	and, and when it's really cold *t*-1 i'm more likely *-2 to wear jeans or pants or sweaters, or that type of thing.	likely
41621:26	just because it's, maybe it's just because of the sexist views and everything	maybe
41674:8	because maybe they, those are not the clothes that *t*-1 are the most, uh, appealing to you, or the most, uh, complimentary to you.	maybe
41698:8	again maybe because i was at the school, there were still many teachers who *t*-2 wore mini skirts,	maybe
41802:64	and they don't allow, uh, any sweat, any sweat shirts or t shirts that *t*-1 might have vulgar, or, you know, anything like that on it,	might
41815:87	whereas, uh, sometimes when you're in the suit and feel, kind of almost stiff and you're not, you know, maybe you don't, uh, can't get as comfortable *-2 to sit down *t*-1	maybe
41863:24	i guess 0 we've talked probably long enough.	probably
42156:13	and that's maybe what you were talking about *t*-1.	maybe
42178:87	i think 0 there's been, i think 0 there's been like six or seven of them, over the last like probably eight or nine months.	probably
42219:10	god, maybe i'll take it out.	maybe
42454:11	it would probably be somewhere closer to, uh, less control because i don't see,	probably
42525:21	but, but maybe we'll prevent a few john hinckleys.	maybe
42736:85	because i started *-2 shooting, my dad started *-3 letting me shoot like a little air b b gun, when i was probably five or six years old *t*-1.	probably
43129:13	this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt, and some saint augustine.	probably
43134:30	and we're just not real into the lawn probably because we're renting, i guess 0 *t*-1, huh?	probably
43364:21	i thought gosh i'd probably have nightmares for the next six months.	probably
43504:11	i should probably go back and read the book now that i just saw the movie again not too long ago.	probably
43690:65	if i ever get the hankering *-1 to see something, i've got, i don't know, maybe about thirty or forty movies	maybe
43819:30	cause when you're touristing *t*-1, you probably don't want *-2 to take the time *-3 to go *-4 see a movie.	probably
43921:46	and primarily, i mean, i, now i'm probably going * to, going *-1 to upset you.	probably
44024:12	which *t*-1 might be a bigger problem than it would be, uh,	might
44365:15	the poverty level is certainly, uh, you know, much worse in the latin american countries.	certainly
44367:59	i think 0 it has something 0 *t*-1 to do with the poverty level because africa is certainly not a catholic, uh, country,	certainly
44397:19	or like you say, maybe communication of * knowing that, hey, up in other english colonies, or previous english colonies, everything is equal and yet down there it's not *?*,	maybe
44400:80	you know, i think 0 communication does have a lot 0 *t*-1 to do with it, you know, in education, maybe.	maybe
44409:18	i think 0 it maybe has * to do with a lo-, a lot 0 *t*-1 to do with education	maybe
44502:8	it certainly is *?*.	certainly
44578:10	oh, possibly four.	possibly
44589:30	and if that weren't so, i would certainly have one.	certainly
44595:13	well, you might want *-1 to get yourself, uh, an animal that *t*-2 doesn't require much attention. like a cat.	might
44674:43	uh, and, and, you know, some people might not believe that	might
44743:193	well, the, see the problem is 0 if, if the, if someone would have came up to me and said it's going *-1 to cost you five hundred dollars *-2 to keep your dog alive. what do you want *-1 to do *t*-2? i probably would have had second thoughts.	probably
44857:187	and i think 0 one of the good ways of * solving that is to like, everybody likes *-1 to come to a party so * have a voting party and, uh, you know, like in communities and have the issues there and then everybody go *-2 vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something.	maybe
44885:19	and ma-, maybe * let them have some mock, i mean uh, you know elections and stuff and vote for different people in their classes and start *-1 really young.	maybe
44895:10	however, probably not enough of them, uh, country wide.	probably
44944:34	and that's the reason 0 i said 0 maybe if you had something like a block party *t*-1.	maybe
44954:10	like, maybe they could give something	maybe
44996:18	and, uh, maybe if they, like you said, if they would start when little kids and start *-1 letting them vote and learn how * to vote and all *t*-3. then, uh, and the importance of it because, okay, if you don't vote for your friend over here, well your friend's not going *-2 to have a chance.	maybe
45029:14	and, uh, certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that, you know, they, they understood that the principles of the country were established *-1 so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant *t*-2	certainly
45070:14	they would understand probably by the time 0 they were in high school *t*-1,	probably
45078:125	they would put them *-4 to realize that, that they're going *-1 to have *-2 to do what someone else says *t*-5 even though they didn't vote for it. and that maybe they need *-3 to think twice about *-6 voting.	maybe
45242:59	but, um, our chows, we've had them, i'd say *rnr*-1, right around six maybe seven years	maybe
45381:18	i mean, some maybe	maybe
45499:79	i wouldn't, i wouldn't dare *-1 have a, a goldfish here because, it would probably be in a small bowl	probably
45773:63	because, * got teams like, like buffalo who *t*-1 weren't, certainly weren't a powerhouse, uh, ten years ago.	certainly
46201:13	but, maybe we, maybe we'll get your guy.	maybe
46201:24	but, maybe we, maybe we'll get your guy.	maybe
46216:22	uh, in dallas there's definitely a crime problem,	definitely
46219:37	in fact, at the moment i'm thinking of *-1 possibly moving to a new apartment	possibly
46222:8	you definitely are going *-1 to worry about the location, and, uh, you know, accessibility *ich*-3 of people * to be able *-2 to break in.	definitely
46491:17	and i guess 0 maybe that's the way 0 tokyo is *t*-1 too, or japan is *t*-1 too.	maybe
46574:68	and i think that people know that they're going *-1 to get a slap on the wrist, they might serve a little bit of time and that they'll be out on the street again.	might
46658:11	it's definitely true because,	definitely
46698:62	but they're still, they're still a lot, i think 0 *t*-1, definitely better than the american carmaker system.	definitely
46700:28	oh, i, i definitely agree with you there,, because i had, uh, uh, uh, ford t bird before i got my honda,	definitely
46718:10	well, maybe you need *-1 to unload it on somebody el-,.	maybe
46720:16	well, i'll probably hold on to it since it's still under warranty	probably
46788:16	well, that's probably influenced maybe a little bit.	probably
46788:22	well, that's probably influenced maybe a little bit.	maybe
46791:4	definitely.	definitely
46809:8	i probably, uh,	probably
46824:13	but i'm definitely going *-1 to look for something, uh, in the, you know, nice, perpor-, you know,	definitely
46857:23	anyway, um, but i'll probably, um,	probably
46883:4	maybe someday.	maybe
46960:4	definitely.	definitely
47147:15	so, that's probably a pretty nice place 0 * to go *t*-1.	probably
47172:10	and then maybe * camp another night and drive home.	maybe
47213:8	they probably just don't spend as much money as a lot of other states might *?*.	probably
47213:49	they probably just don't spend as much money as a lot of other states might *?*.	might
47233:24	you know, you really can probably count thousands of stars,	probably
47282:36	the days, get up into the high eighties, uh, maybe the nineties	maybe
47466:5	maybe it was the other new york team which *t*-1 is the yankees,	maybe
47683:8	you probably can't afford *-1 to eat if you have more than two of them.	probably
47729:8	he probably has an income of thirty-five thousand,	probably
47751:21	you're just as blessed, probably more, because if you follow this,	probably
47793:42	but, um, it's kind of a different situation because you're probably living in an apartment, right?	probably
47966:28	well, that, that certainly can happen now if	certainly
48053:32	usually, uh, my husband was seldom home for maybe forty-five minutes or so	maybe
48120:15	and we certainly, uh, we need more of that,	certainly
48216:92	well, on a scale of one to ten, uh, being *ich*-1 ten, no, kind of legislation and zero being, uh, total ban, i probably would lean more towards six or seven.	probably
48247:10	but it certainly didn't get any better.	certainly
48256:13	but you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature, uh, you know,	definitely
48284:7	and maybe they just don't report those	maybe
48296:30	um, and i don't think 0 i probably ever would *?*, um, although i would like *-1 to know how *-2 to handle one *t*-3,	probably
48301:30	um, you just never know when you might come into contact with one *t*-1.	might
48344:63	most of that's done *-1 with rifles and such. uh, though there's, you know, probably i'm sure 0 *t*-3 some sector that *t*-2 does it with handguns.	probably
48361:28	but i, i think definitely,	definitely
48368:11	i would definitely support that.	definitely
48372:123	i, i, i agree 0 the thing *ich*-2 that *t*-1 scares me, uh, though about where i would, i would wa-, definitely want some sort of legislation *t*-3	definitely
48502:105	and we use the computers a great deal for word processing, you know, because students really do seem *-1 to be freer when they write on the computer *t*-2, as you probably found out yourself,	probably
48680:26	and even for a personal computer it's probably smart * to spend that much,	probably
48762:23	um, i think 0 it might have a spelling editor on it,	might
48832:14	and that's probably the way 0 i feel *t*-4 about it is, is, uh, it kind of depends on the crime that *t*-2's committed *-3.	probably
48841:5	probably pretty similar views on it,	probably
48847:35	well, there's, there's probably two or three different types of, of views as far as the controversy goes.	probably
48892:32	and that's, that's certainly no kind of deterrent,	certainly
48898:15	and you can, probably spend, uh, a lot of time, uh, or * maybe eventually, uh, just waiting it out,	probably
48898:54	and you can, probably spend, uh, a lot of time, uh, or * maybe eventually, uh, just waiting it out,	maybe
49054:8	it might be,	might
49055:24	i would say 0 it's probably midsized for the area.	probably
49064:18	it is, uh, probably ten years old.	probably
49175:18	uh, reasonable construction would probably run you, uh, right now anywhere between, somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars.	probably
49176:7	and probably, perhaps, cheaper, depending upon the neighborhood.	probably
49231:46	like most areas that *t*-1 are built *-2, um, there were probably, like two or three styles 0 you could choose from *t*-1.	probably
49235:62	and, and, uh, that's pretty much all the houses in the area, for probably a square mile, i'd say, at least, maybe even a little bit more than that.	probably
49235:93	and, and, uh, that's pretty much all the houses in the area, for probably a square mile, i'd say, at least, maybe even a little bit more than that.	maybe
49239:11	maryland is probably one of the most expensive, places 0 * to,	probably
49313:207	on a, on a, on a, what we would, you know, what you described *t*-2 as your house and what i would describe *t*-1 as my house say, for example, in pensacola, florida, on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on, * might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes.	might
49314:21	may-, maybe, you know, maybe a little bit higher than that now,	maybe
49314:42	may-, maybe, you know, maybe a little bit higher than that now,	maybe
49331:107	uh, so, the question of whether * to buy here or move to another county, say, drive twenty more miles north, buy a condominium for approximately, uh, the same price, maybe a little lower,	maybe
49334:37	but the taxes would be, you know, perhaps, maybe one-third uh, of,	maybe
49075:47	* let's say 0 compared to maryland, that same house here would probably cost three-quarters of a million dollars	probably
49526:10	the mazda definitely did not.	definitely
49558:9	so, probably what i'll do *t*-1 again.	probably
49639:11	mine was definitely not impulse	definitely
49744:31	well, i think 0 we're on, maybe.	maybe
49814:181	but i think, uh, actually, uh, in, in *-3 trying *-1 to follow, uh, you know the cowboys over the years i think, uh, uh, 0 they used *-2 to have a, um, a philosophy for, well i don't know, probably the last twenty-five years except for about the last about five or six years uh,	probably
49908:73	spring training until you actually start *-1 going out and getting, uh, getting out against the competition everything probably looks pretty good.	probably
49960:203	but, of course, you know, the, the, the one, the griping is that if, you know, if, if washington doesn't get a, uh, a baseball team then baltimore shouldn't get a football team. which *t*-1 is probably true,	probably
50200:18	and it's certainly, and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years.	certainly
50200:34	and it's certainly, and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years.	certainly
50368:11	that's probably true,	probably
50369:11	that's probably true.	probably
50831:13	and it was definitely voluntary, too.	definitely
50865:23	and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort.	certainly
50876:11	it's probably a, a very good way 0 * to keep them off the streets and out of trouble *t*-1,	probably
50961:16	not insofar as * maybe making conversation with somebody, i suppose *t*-2, because it, you can easily be overhear-, overheard *-1	maybe
51130:26	i, i can probably go on,	probably
51135:8	i probably better *-1 let you get back to work.	probably
51230:40	i mean, the guy's twenty, twenty-five home rums, maybe thirty, eighty some r b i-s.	maybe
51390:39	i'll be, i'll be upset probably even though my prediction will be right.	probably
51841:54	i'm scared, i would be scared to death 0 my child might accidentally get out,	might
51958:32	and i'm, i'm probably a little too over protective	probably
52021:30	i haven't been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months,	probably
52026:13	but i rent probably four or five movies a week.	probably
52061:74	i, i guess 0 one of my favorite, well two of my favorite movies is probably like lethal weapon and lethal weapon two.	probably
52109:40	i, i have *-1 to say that probably the one movie that *t*-2 really threw me back the most, uh, that i was really the most in shock with *t*-3 was probably, uh, star wars.	probably
52109:119	i, i have *-1 to say that probably the one movie that *t*-2 really threw me back the most, uh, that i was really the most in shock with *t*-3 was probably, uh, star wars.	probably
52145:11	that's probably something 0 i need *-1 to see *t*-2 right now because i'm taking history in school.	probably
52149:13	so it'd probably be a good thing 0 for me to see *t*-1.	probably
52259:36	we, we actually rent, uh, probably a go-, good combination of movies with the exception of horror films.	probably
52314:16	you know students might try *-1 to do it.	might
52318:14	well that's probably true.	probably
52420:11	that's probably true,	probably
52421:11	that's probably true.	probably
52462:13	that one is definitely worth * seeing,	definitely
52595:8	we definitely have lost the judeo-christian ethic of the judicial system for sure,	definitely
52629:11	there would probably be very few exceptions to that	probably
52723:18	i feel like that might be better, if it was run *-1 on a more scriptural basis, which *t*-2 would include, you know, you know, and * expediting the penalties and just getting it over with.	might
52766:30	uh, we try *-1 to go once, maybe twice a summer. uh, we, uh, just, you know, for like a short weekend or something.	maybe
53385:73	oh, um, uh, i usually don't get *-1 to hea-, hear any of the current events probably until about the ten o'clock news.	probably
53507:15	i mean, probably * would have paid the same amount	probably
53547:24	i mean, because that would definitely look like another korea,	definitely
53738:34	i mean, that's, that might be the only thing.	might
53739:37	but, i mean, i, i definitely agree with you.	definitely
53755:8	i definitely agree.	definitely
53808:46	i saw something on the news, oh, i don't know, maybe two weeks ago.	maybe
53830:8	i definitely agree with parents.	definitely
53838:50	i mean, either way. you know, i, i definitely had *-1 to disagree with that.	definitely
53899:15	so, they're definitely going *-1 to work towards *-2 being good, you know, rather than trying *-3 to act up and be bad, you know.	definitely
53909:22	, i mean, my kids definitely get spanked *-1 when they need they need *-2 to be spanked *-3 *t*-4.	definitely
53979:18	it's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend.	maybe
54139:27	but, but it's certainly something that *t*-1 has a lot of things 0 * to talk about *t*-2.	certainly
54385:7	and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid.	maybe
54605:26	i thought 0 it was kind of maybe for kids more, than ad-,	maybe
54625:46	well if you, if you liked beetlejuice you'll probably like edward scissorhands,	probably
54626:29	if you didn't like beetlejuice you'll probably won't like edward scissorhands.	probably
54718:23	i, i might have seen part of that because the name sounds familiar although i wo-, i would remember, i think 0 *t*-1 in, with him in it.	might
54787:16	um, you've probably seen him	probably
54872:15	so, we're probably going *-1 to like rent those some time and then try *-2 to see godfather part three somewhere.	probably
54938:8	i probably saw parts of those.	probably
54951:15	and then the titles might sound familiar	might
54955:28	of the three of those, diner's probably the best.	probably
55017:20	and, uh, i was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on t v *t*-1 when the cowboys were playing the saint louis cardinals *t*-2	probably
55026:69	and i think 0 that's quite a bit of optimism *ich*-1 around here that still there's a chance that maybe, uh, these guys are right, maybe they will come through and, and do something this year.	maybe
55026:93	and i think 0 that's quite a bit of optimism *ich*-1 around here that still there's a chance that maybe, uh, these guys are right, maybe they will come through and, and do something this year.	maybe
55035:15	and you know maybe the stuff that, uh, jerry jones is talking about *t*-1 the construction and * redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting *-2 to pay off.	maybe
55035:75	and you know maybe the stuff that, uh, jerry jones is talking about *t*-1 the construction and * redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting *-2 to pay off.	maybe
55035:83	and you know maybe the stuff that, uh, jerry jones is talking about *t*-1 the construction and * redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting *-2 to pay off.	might
55095:11	he's probably like a lot of quarterbacks, uh,	probably
55115:21	i think 0 they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year,	probably
55117:11	they'll probably get everybody's hopes up and blow it toward the end.	probably
55123:44	uh, i'm figuring either one either the eagles or possibly san francisco	possibly
55289:11	there's probably five or six, which *t*-1 would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs, that *t*-2 are in positions over some of these soviet states.	probably
55317:74	if the bombs don't get you, if the bullets don't get you, then, then the nerve gas definitely will get you.	definitely
55342:4	definitely.	definitely
55445:13	but it's definitely a task.	definitely
55667:32	i guess then 0 the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you, wouldn't it *?*?	probably
55765:28	i think 0 i have gone home maybe once or twice *-1 slightly sore.	maybe
55797:18	i'm considering *-1 maybe even buying one of those too.	maybe
55863:16	it'd probably be, it'd probably be good,	probably
55863:33	it'd probably be, it'd probably be good,	probably
55881:199	but i, i felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone, or go into a military situation, that they could help the country in other ways. be it * cleaning out, uh, lots, in, in their neighborhood or, whatever kind of community or public service *t*-2 might be available.	might
55892:20	i just see that as maybe a good idea.	maybe
55958:10	uh, definitely.	definitely
55960:8	it might not be the same neighborhood, but the same city or county, because then you're, you're coming in contact with it.	might
56017:30	the adults, uh, ahead of it would probably never serve and, and to each succeeding generation.	probably
56018:8	there definitely would have *-1 to be a major p r campaign in each community, each county, uh, parish or however the state was divided *-2 up *t*-3.	definitely
56066:97	and, um, i'm pretty sure i saw, yeah, stuff *ich*-1 in ohio and indi-, indiana *ich*-2 about it and pennsylvania, maybe pennsylvania,	maybe
56096:55	and i, i'm worried that it, it might, you know, it'll, it, the same thing will happen.	might
56104:117	and if you look at history at all, you see that, you know, uh, we go from one side to the other on just about any subject, that you, one might care *-1 to bring *t*-2 up.	might
56116:19	it *exp*-1's just probably a good thing that the oil's burning and may, may, make some people realize that hey, you know, this stuff runs out.	probably
56120:19	of course, that's probably blasphemy 0 for you to say *t*-3, uh, *-2 coming from where you are *t*-1 in texas.	probably
56847:60	maybe not in a, in a deep philosophical sense, but in a selfish sense, it probably would *?*.	probably
56934:7	and certainly that's true in the overall,	certainly
56937:184	when they especially when someone, they,, they don't vote for someone because they don't like any of them and then the person gets in and they don't like him and he turns out *-1 to have been worse than her that they might have voted for *t*-2, or something like that *t*-3.	might
56996:15	well, uh, maybe they should *?*,	maybe
57037:24	maybe it should, maybe it should be *?*.	maybe
57106:83	and, there's a notion that somehow, if someone isn't as much as a government person, they're less corrupt and they're more likely *-1 to be good which *t*-2 is really strange,	likely
57415:15	i think 0 maybe it was nine ninety-nine or something.	maybe
57464:62	i haven't gotten really involved in anything, uh, extensive in car repairs in, oh, oh, probably a year or so.	probably
57559:49	i mean, though for what you could get *t*-1 for one, you might as well drive it over a cliff.	might
57568:13	and that was probably one of the most miserable things 0 i had gotten into *t*-1 in a long time.	probably
57615:22	i don't notice it, probably because i don-,	probably
57626:7	but maybe because i'm not looking for it.	maybe
57824:28	so i guess 0 i've done probably, uh, i'd say seven or eight of them.	probably
57844:5	maybe they're burnt out or,	maybe
57859:16	and so there's probably a lot of things 0 i remember *t*-1 and a lot of things that i really didn't have a clue as to what *t*-2 was happening *t*-3.	probably
57863:25	um, * looking back, like maybe some of the things that i know *t*-1 now, i, i'm not sure 0 i do believe 0 it was worth the cost in dollars and lives.	maybe
57875:28	you know, i just feel like maybe we went in *-1 to be policeman	maybe
57890:19	don't you think that maybe that's why we had it this time *t*-1?	maybe
57892:17	but i feel like maybe the american people and, and the government are aware of the things that we did *t*-1 wrong that we didn't support that, that those,	maybe
57957:58	uh, you know whether it was justified or not, i know, that *t*-1 they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause.	probably
57958:30	i, i feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing *-2 to try and help *-1 maintain the democracy over there and, and beat the communism,	maybe
58006:15	i think that maybe a lot of the arab countries that *t*-1 were so hateful towards the united states have come away with, uh, kind of a different attitude.	maybe
58010:20	uh, i think that maybe we're not their big bad enemy any more.	maybe
58278:23	except i think, that they probably just said well, we're just going *-1 to start *-2 using the things now	probably
58281:74	of course, * being part of the european community, if everybody else did it they, they were probably much more,	probably
58285:30	that's, that's probably true	probably
58316:59	but human nature being such as it is *?*, i would think 0 it would take, probably, two or three years before people co-, could completely cut the cord.	probably
58439:25	so we, we definitely have different tastes,	definitely
58929:11	you probably could *?*,	probably
58930:8	you probably could *?*,	probably
58949:23	well, uh, the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so.	definitely
59082:23	and, if i'd of probably had three or four children, i don't see how *t*-2 we could have made it, you know, without me working *t*-1.	probably
59084:32	but that's, that's probably because, you know, if you had three, you, you know, would say, if i'd of had four.	probably
59086:16	but in essence you probably would have worked out fine.	probably
59202:11	they're probably going, oh, i bet 0 she can't get pregnant	probably
59228:32	now, she says that, you know, maybe when she's thirty *t*-1 she might want a child then.	maybe
59228:55	now, she says that, you know, maybe when she's thirty *t*-1 she might want a child then.	might
59338:67	um, i guess 0 on a one, a scale of one of ten i'm probably around a two in terms of fair * restricting guns	probably
59365:70	and on top of that *-1 spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military, as a green beret, i definitely respect the power of weaponry.	definitely
59469:18	i mean, i certainly feel that if, if, we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm *t*-1	certainly
59470:17	but, uh, i certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility * to know how * do, use it safely *t*-2 as someone learns how * to drive *t*-1, if not more so.	certainly
59632:56	well as, as someone who *t*-2 would, would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander, i feel more comfortable with people having blades because, uh, you're not going *-1 to get bullets flying around *-3 killing people instantly	possibly
59647:8	they probably, need *-1 to change it somehow, uh,	probably
59649:87	we've just got too many people in there, and, uh, mumblex, are putting too many, uh, people *ich*-1 in jail that *t*-2 probably don't need *-3 to be there	probably
59701:37	and they were told *-1 that, uh, he would probably serve three, of the fifteen, and that he had three previous convictions.	probably
59736:10	the judge might know	might
59749:13	well, we definitely need a change in the system	definitely
59795:21	and, and maybe so,	maybe
59850:12	and, * maybe let the judge have a opportunity 0 * to make, a decision *t*-1.	maybe
59906:4	probably,	probably
59926:22	it was like, hey, maybe you're still allergic to the dog.	maybe
60149:33	i could see some *-1 having, maybe some of the tropical fish, that *t*-2 are really, really pretty	maybe
60272:59	it *exp*-1's not fair to a pet *ich*-2 * to have a pet here, or certainly, certainly not a dog,	certainly
60272:67	it *exp*-1's not fair to a pet *ich*-2 * to have a pet here, or certainly, certainly not a dog,	certainly
60315:37	last time 0 i was there *t*-1 was fall so probably wasn't that bad.	probably
60565:40	and there's lots and lots of companies that *t*-1 have maybe not in the de-, the defense area but manufacturing in general.	maybe
60573:124	and, and i seem rather happy about it *ich*-2 most of the time, *-3 just, just to know, what's, possibilities *t*-1 are, you know, what *t*-4 might happen.	might
60705:7	and maybe i'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if i don't get laid *-1 off between now and then.	maybe
60799:62	you know, wh-, when you consider, you know, 0 it's probably not radioactive *t*-1	probably
60853:15	it *exp*-2's probably a lot easier *ich*-4 * to detect things that *t*-1 go into the ground than it *exp*-3 is maybe *?* * to just,	probably
60853:77	it *exp*-2's probably a lot easier *ich*-4 * to detect things that *t*-1 go into the ground than it *exp*-3 is maybe *?* * to just,	maybe
61160:42	and, i would think, you know, 0 he might, i mean, he might could get hurt *-1 by a car or something.	might
61160:64	and, i would think, you know, 0 he might, i mean, he might could get hurt *-1 by a car or something.	might
61304:10	you most likely will *?*.	likely
61338:30	i, we will probably will put some things up. some posters and stuff up.	probably
61342:31	and hopefully that will help, you know, maybe around the neighborhood.	maybe
61427:19	and, i think 0 maybe he would *?* if it came real close,	maybe
61558:21	i guess 0 that's probably true.	probably
61738:29	well, actually one other thing 0 i might ought *-2 to mention *t*-1 is that they are actually getting quite cheap.	might
61741:4	definitely,	definitely
61801:5	probably the way 0 * to do it if you really wanted *-1 to buy one *t*-2 is 0 there's a magazine called * computer shopper.	probably
61810:13	and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages.	probably
61827:11	it's probably a half a dozen companies *ich*-2 around the world that *t*-1 are making those mother boards, the main computer, the circuit board.	probably
61938:8	they certainly are *?*.	certainly
61979:29	and i don't know that it *exp*-1 might do them a little bit of good * to see the world from a different perspective.	might
62033:57	i think 0 that's a good way for people to, you know, maybe get people to come back to these small towns *-3 to work by *-4 helping people that *t*-1 normally might not be able *-2 to go to college and get the type of degree 0 they want *t*-5.	maybe
62033:124	i think 0 that's a good way for people to, you know, maybe get people to come back to these small towns *-3 to work by *-4 helping people that *t*-1 normally might not be able *-2 to go to college and get the type of degree 0 they want *t*-5.	might
62100:10	but it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that *t*-4 have everything *ich*-2 given *-1 to them that they want *t*-3 to see what it's like *t*-6 if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want *t*-5 when you want it *t*-7.	definitely
62138:7	and maybe this is why this has died out *t*-1.	maybe
62198:105	down here with the peace corps we're talking about all these people that *t*-1 aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that i think 0 *t*-2 probably need help and, could be helped *-3 *t*-4.	probably
62211:7	and maybe rather than * just, require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like, um, during college, you know, * maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required *-1 to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the united states *t*-2.	maybe
62211:55	and maybe rather than * just, require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like, um, during college, you know, * maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required *-1 to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the united states *t*-2.	maybe
62211:89	and maybe rather than * just, require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like, um, during college, you know, * maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required *-1 to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the united states *t*-2.	maybe
62217:8	there probably are *?*, you know,	probably
62220:11	that's probably like	probably
62280:83	so, we're a little fa-, you know, farther removed from like dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing *t*-1.	probably
62378:29	these things won't make any sense to you probably	probably
62425:8	they probably didn't know what they were talking about *t*-1.	probably
62587:50	i think 0 this is a, i think 0 this is maybe a name brand	maybe
62588:23	and i suspect that it's probably, just a fluke, you know.	probably
62681:79	and it kind of has *-1 to start from the top and, and go clea-, or from the bottom maybe and go clear up.	maybe
62748:24	it probab-, it probably basically goes right back into the h-, home though unfortunately.	probably
62882:30	i think 0 i've been *?* two maybe three times the month of april,	maybe
63067:99	so, you know, you, not only, you know, you're not only doing something *-1 to keep yourself fit, but you're probably prolonging your life.	probably
63084:25	so i think 0 a tuesday thursday might be a little bit better.	might
63088:57	of course, i feel like once i've done it, if i'm sweaty i might as well do an extra thirty minutes, because you've already kind of shot your night.	might
63106:86	but i'm glad 0 it's not too totally cheap, because if it was too cheap i would talk myself out of *-1 going more, probably.	probably
63154:31	they make it as easy *ich*-1 as they possibly can *?* for you.	possibly
63161:11	they have probably, ooh, i'd say *rnr*-2 fifteen different, fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that *t*-1 are running,	probably
63322:32	the, uh, i think 0 maybe there's where the problem came in *t*-1, you know.	maybe
63532:15	i thought 0 maybe they would convert to, uh, metric back when they went to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit *t*-1, because what is it *t*-2 fifty-six or fifty-seven's a hundred, uh, qua-, a hundred kilometers,	maybe
63881:18	i mean, i might not have that much,	might
64131:7	but maybe that's what *t*-1 rounds it, i don't know.	maybe
64249:41	but if i were *-1 to live some place else, it certainly meets my standards.	certainly
64369:9	maybe, maybe i'm used to texas.	maybe
64369:17	maybe, maybe i'm used to texas.	maybe
64561:35	because baltimore will play more, uh, what *t*-1 might be considered *-2 m-, a little bit more progressive?	might
64582:167	if, you know, like when the doors movie came out *t*-1, you know, doors was really on the radio *ich*-3 there, you know. where, you know, you'd hear was-, one or two of their more famous songs, maybe top forty in baltimore *t*-2,	maybe
64859:36	the n-, the next time, uh, probably a year and a half from now, we're going *-1 to try *-2 to build.	probably
64946:29	and the, the housing market probably still going *-1 to even go lower.	probably
65116:20	i pro-, probably should *?*.	probably
65247:36	well, i mean 0 he's doing all right, probably.	probably
65285:14	so you're probably, uh, a baltimore fan *ich*-1, right, an oriole fan?	probably
65537:21	and it's takes us maybe, uh, we-, well, thirty-five to forty minutes *-1 to get there from plano, which *t*-2 is not too bad at all.	maybe
65600:7	so maybe i will *?*.	maybe
65675:30	they think 0 they need *-1 to, maybe have, uh, you know, private, you know, business, private enterprise come in.	maybe
65787:53	but, uh, you know, i think, 0 uh, they, maybe they need *-2 to, uh, help *-3 promote that more. give incentives like, uh, if they do bring somebody on, they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is *t*-1, you know, for them to train people, you know, stuff like that.	maybe
66002:25	because we never know when we might, you know, get laid *-3 off or something *t*-4.	might
66014:51	and i think 0 they're getting ready *-2 to, to probably sell us *ich*-1 out, our division.	probably
66034:23	it, it certainly is *?*.	certainly
66118:8	you might even find 0 somebody's been reporting on you	might
66120:41	you know, you, i mean you might think 0 you're paying something on time	might
66228:32	so that's, that's probably the worst thing 0 i've ever had *t*-1 happen with a credit card.	probably
66310:109	um, i think if they, if they started *-1 executing them on a regular basis, uh, that i think 0 it might make a difference.	might
66366:13	well at least maybe the guy 0 they cross *t*-1 next time is going *-2 to *?*.	maybe
66518:30	well the thing 0 i'd be most likely *-1 to attach the death penalty to *t*-2 is the violence.	likely
66527:26	and the people 0 i'd most likely want *-1 to sentence *t*-2 to death are the people that *t*-3 just show a really low regard for human life.	likely
66973:59	i, uh, ride bicycles,, uh, fifteen, twenty miles, i don't know, maybe three times, maybe four times a week.	maybe
66973:69	i, uh, ride bicycles,, uh, fifteen, twenty miles, i don't know, maybe three times, maybe four times a week.	maybe
67062:44	so i began a program couple, i don't know probably three or four weeks ago	probably
67151:15	i mean, maybe it's because of the winters. uh, or maybe just because, you know, there's, there's a lot more flat lands, you know, out in the west.	maybe
67151:44	i mean, maybe it's because of the winters. uh, or maybe just because, you know, there's, there's a lot more flat lands, you know, out in the west.	maybe
67216:30	i've, i've definitely noticed 0 it's had a good effect on my pulse rate, my resting pulse.	definitely
67427:28	and i felt, felt probably worse for them than, than for me because, oh gosh they, the, uh, this fellow's wife who *t*-1 was, uh, watching the dog, pro-, she, i think 0 *t*-2 she loved that dog more than i did	probably
67597:21	and up here the water's probably about forty degrees right now.	probably
67798:9	maybe, maybe if i went back and took a sociology class now they'd say 0 it is a deterrent.	maybe
67798:17	maybe, maybe if i went back and took a sociology class now they'd say 0 it is a deterrent.	maybe
67895:21	i think 0 i'd probably do it	probably
67932:15	but i want, maybe	maybe
67949:7	and maybe, now, i don't remember if this *ich*-3 is texas or not, that *t*-1 has something about 0 all drug dealers can be sentenced *-2 to the death sentence.	maybe
68001:33	i, i think 0 it certainly should be one of the options.	certainly
68030:15	and the youngest is probably twenty-seven, twenty-eight.	probably
68305:21	but, uh, more than likely the people that *t*-1 are on the, the jury know what they're doing *t*-2.	likely
68375:8	i definitely feel like we need *-1 to keep it at least unanimous because, uh, you know, there's the classic sort of * to kill a mockingbird kind of story where you get, you know, jury which *t*-2 can have all kinds of prejudices and things that, a judge at least officially isn't supposed *-3 to have *t*-4. though, of course they can *?*, too *t*-5.	definitely
68474:28	i guess 0 it's just that maybe people are, you know, upset at court, you know.	maybe
68668:31	we're going *-1 to get down, probably down norfork sometime this summer, *-1 just to see why, catch a football game actually.	probably
68734:26	and that's enough for, uh, probably another twenty years.	probably
68784:30	we've been *?* two or three times and probably go back again this winter.	probably
69011:21	i was thinking 0 i might be minor league	might
69087:27	i guess 0 if i did, maybe i would *?*	maybe
69096:13	but that would probably bother me *-4 to wake up one day and find out halfway through the day that you're going *-1 to be drug tested *-2 and you didn't know about it.	probably
69220:13	and that's probably the biggest problem 0 there is *t*-1.	probably
69551:10	uh, maybe,	maybe
69558:4	probably.	probably
69569:34	and ha-, then all of your family probably has not met your husband.	probably
69623:37	well, um, i think 0 we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes.	probably
69637:7	and maybe i'll talk to you again.	maybe
69860:64	and the water in medina lake and that area was really going down, that they were considering that they might have *-1 to do water rationing	might
70163:32	so that's, that's maybe not so typical,	maybe
70188:21	i mean, i got probably the biggest,	probably
70301:34	but, uh, since that's over with now, maybe i can, i can get this yard in shape.	maybe
70354:11	you could probably do that.	probably
70357:39	i've talked about *-1 adding at least one more room and definitely adding another bath on.	definitely
70617:112	well, i found, uh, that, in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget *t*-6 was not where we were concerned *-5 *t*-2, but where maybe our friends *ich*-1 were concerned *-4 and our relatives and parents *t*-3.	maybe
70750:32	well, i'm sure that, uh, probably every person in this country would agree with you on that. because everybody has a different idea of where the money should go *t*-1.	probably
70774:251	why i, i'm, i'm a little concerned about *t*-2 today is that this, uh, rather, uh, quick and, and easy, i don't know, i shouldn't say easy, rather quick victory in the, in, in the, uh, mideast, uh, uh, over the, uh, iraqis, uh, might lead us into, uh, a false sense *ich*-1 of security that we can do that against any other foe.	might
71208:5	maybe this climate is a little better.	maybe
71448:8	i probably couldn't do that because of my knee.	probably
71582:38	and we had about, when i was there *t*-1, maybe thirteen hundred people.	maybe
71647:41	i'd be afraid,, afraid 0 i probably forgot how * to ride a bike *t*-1, you know.	probably
71814:37	i'm, i guess 0 i probably put on about ten, nine or ten pounds, since i stopped *-2 playing, which *t*-1 was about four years ago.	probably
71967:67	but realistically that's, i'm, i'm realizing 0 that's probably not going *-1 to be possible, um, for middle-class people to be able *-2 to live just on one income.	probably
72057:5	maybe that's contributed *-1 to a lot of the problems that we see *t*-2 all the time,	maybe
72123:105	i guess unless, unless there's a, a major swing in the change of what *t*-1's important to people, you know, probably keep * going downhill.	probably
72356:5	maybe i have a problem.	maybe
72767:9	maybe not, maybe they're not really concerned about *-1 getting paid	maybe
72767:19	maybe not, maybe they're not really concerned about *-1 getting paid	maybe
72891:78	um, years ago, well, th-, i had my visa card through this bank in oklahoma city for, oh, probably fifteen years,	probably
72999:13	well, we certainly found that to be true.	certainly
73049:76	so, um, i can see where someone, you know, in a position like that, in a live-in capacity, would definitely be the way 0 * to go *t*-1 if you're, you're lucky enough *-3 to have the financial mumblex 0 * to be able *-2 to do that *t*-4 *t*-5.	definitely
73085:13	well, it certainly is *?*. uh,	certainly
73127:41	it's a matter *ich*-2 not necessarily, uh, that she *ich*-3 might want *-1 to stay home or he, as well,	might
73176:18	i think 0 that might be part of the problem with some people. you know,	might
73247:60	i guess 0 you find out that you're a much stronger person than you thought *?*, maybe.	maybe
73442:58	you know, uh, as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job 0 * to do *t*-1.	definitely
73451:7	and maybe that has a lot 0 * to do *t*-1 with it.	maybe
73454:23	i, i definitely think 0 that has gotten a lot worse,	definitely
73610:11	i've probably seen him around.	probably
73704:19	* catch them next year probably.	probably
73717:16	well my kids are probably needing me to go	probably
73873:114	i think 0 the other thing is that, uh, we have taken some rather drastic turns in our, in our education and the way 0 we approach things *t*-1 as of maybe starting back when, when i'm number one, you know, and, uh, uh, uh, * worrying about self and not, uh, seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family *t*-2.	maybe
73952:93	uh, you know, with farming being so mechanized, uh, people working on the family farm which *t*-1 was a traditional american way that becomes less and less likely,	likely
73986:8	it certainly is *?*.	certainly
74141:14	well i think probably that *t*-1 we've just about.	probably
74163:8	i certainly do.	certainly
74257:23	but i believe that there's definitely a basic perception and image problem with the fact of * even being a teacher.	definitely
74300:17	maybe not the four years definitely.	definitely
74312:15	i thought that maybe something.	maybe
74315:67	at least what i used *-2 to observe *t*-3 in student teaching, was that some college kid who *t*-1 might not be all that bright * to begin with, was thrown *-7 into a class room with a teacher who *t*-4 was harried and overworked and, uh, had too many kids 0 * to handle *t*-5 and too many things 0 * to do *t*-6 and too many interruptions * to pay much attention to the student teacher.	might
74397:13	well, * definitely is a national problem if, that they need *-1 to address *t*-2.	definitely
74404:17	and i hope 0 maybe we're going *-1 to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid *-2 to it with, uh, reagan's, uh, new education secretary and, uh, you know, trying * to do some, uh, trying *-3 to produce some new programs anyway.	maybe
74459:17	we kind of need maybe one more room.	maybe
74765:19	your husband probably knows.	probably
74767:8	he probably knows,	probably
74861:8	you might as well *?*	might
74947:119	and, i can very clearly remember 0 ten years ago i was just beginning *-1 to explore *-2 computerizing my office and, and trying *-1 to find out what kinds of computers *t*-3 might be useful	might
74963:111	i, i've seen that just in the last, uh, even five years *ich*-2 how much they've in-, uh, increased in use *t*-1. or probably eight years,	probably
74992:12	well, very possibly.	possibly
74994:10	uh, certainly in the last thirty i would say 0 *t*-1 there have been significant changes. even, even the change from black and white to color television.	certainly
75061:11	that's certainly, a difference.	certainly
75155:79	you think 0 that's caused a lot of pressure *ich*-1 on, like younger kids today, * to make choices that they probably shouldn't have *-2 to make *t*-3?	probably
75173:57	in my day, we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected 0 *t*-1 might be, sleeping with their boyfriends.	might
75180:12	but, they certainly didn't expect everybody to *?*	certainly
75185:10	and i certainly know from *-1 talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays.	certainly
75198:8	i certainly wouldn't have been able *-1 to twenty years ago tell you what, uh, my kids were likely *-2 to be like *t*-3.	certainly
75198:66	i certainly wouldn't have been able *-1 to twenty years ago tell you what, uh, my kids were likely *-2 to be like *t*-3.	likely
75267:10	uh, probably the biggest thing 0 we've got *t*-1 going now is the robberies	probably
75268:13	and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have *t*-1.	probably
75275:13	but i'd probably say 0 that's roughly right.	probably
75277:79	but i, i think 0 with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff i'd say 0 probably the police department would claim 0 the number one crimes, crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution, uh, and sale of drugs.	probably
75277:125	but i, i think 0 with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff i'd say 0 probably the police department would claim 0 the number one crimes, crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution, uh, and sale of drugs.	probably
75280:17	prob-, probably right, if you look at it from that stand point.	probably
75316:33	our major crimes in our immediate town, uh, is probably robberies, house robberies	probably
75345:59	uh, i would say 0 the majority of it's happening during the day, uh, between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon.	probably
75363:38	uh, so, uh, i would say 0 that's probably their prime motivation.	probably
75390:28	i think 0 they could, uh, definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use *t*-1.	definitely
75424:23	that would be, certainly be a deterrent.	certainly
75492:16	well, you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something, right, and try *-1 to get money from him	probably
75594:61	and that, that's a deterrent, too. if you think 0 the home owner might be armed, right, and awake	might
75602:38	that's, i mean that's certainly a possibility in, in,	certainly
75616:25	uh, i would say 0 probably eighty percent of them that *t*-1 are caught *-2, they're from places like up in oklahoma, and louisiana, arkansas, you know, across the, the border.	probably
75712:16	and, as you probably heard from the, in the dallas and texas area period the housing market is just unreal.	probably
75726:10	well, maybe you can, uh, make that one charming and, and make a little bit money, uh,	maybe
75796:41	for instance, one thing that i did *t*-1 that *t*-2 might even be a good suggestion for you uh, was something 0 i did *t*-3 on the outside.	might
75986:11	that's probably, because they had, you know	probably
76012:86	if they have problems with, uh, sand bugs of some kind i think 0 *t*-3 all 0 they need *t*-1 to do *t*-4 is probably *-2 put some insecticide down in there on a, oh, a fairly regular basis, for a while anyway.	probably
76077:13	it might, it might do it,	might
76077:24	it might, it might do it,	might
76083:25	i think, uh, 0 you probably just need *-1 to make * sure that it dries, very, very careful-, uh, well, before she lets her cats out, or something, like that.	probably
76103:44	of everything that i did *t*-1, i guess 0 i enjoyed probably *-2 wallpapering the most	probably
76145:63	they seem *-1 to be burdening the school system more and more with problems, any problems that a child might have *t*-2, whether it's actually a school related thing or not	might
76158:64	it's gotten way beyond * teaching, uh, you know, teaching classes and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like, oh, were kind of traditionally the school's roles.	maybe
76192:8	whether maybe through a commitment of the p t a, uh, and the parents being informed *-2 better, that in fact that the problems that *t*-1 are nationwide are problems, um, of society, and that, that the school can only do so much on it.	maybe
76265:42	and then you throw in kids that *t*-1 are not motivated, maybe bright,	maybe
76352:14	what could they possibly be thinking *t*-1.	possibly
76665:33	uh, the, the call was probably for her.	probably
76689:33	well, the sport 0 i like *t*-1 best probably is basketball.	probably
76690:30	but, uh, i guess 0 i'm probably better at softball.	probably
76754:7	or maybe this evening anyway.	maybe
77003:116	um, from the people 0 i've talked to *t*-1, i don't know if i should bring this into it, but, um, a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers that *t*-3 are more, um, where they could manage their own schedule and, uh, they could spend more time with their kids *t*-2	probably
77032:21	and, and maybe after we decide *-1 to have kids i, i might find a job that *t*-2 has flexible hours.	maybe
77032:65	and, and maybe after we decide *-1 to have kids i, i might find a job that *t*-2 has flexible hours.	might
77085:16	unfortunately, that's probably true.	probably
77166:24	i think that, uh, probably ninety percent of the, of the, um parents out there are, are probably working parents.	probably
77166:86	i think that, uh, probably ninety percent of the, of the, um parents out there are, are probably working parents.	probably
77425:7	and certainly not to the extent 0 i did with my mother *t*-1.	certainly
77651:70	we, um, as i said, *-1 living in an area of washington, d c. we definitely see this,	definitely
77984:11	well they might be car pooling too.	might
77993:44	but, uh, now my daughter ha-, they have probably been carpooling together, in fact,	probably
78225:14	then that's probably one of the reasons 0 our,	probably
78249:66	i think 0 the, the minimum age for diving is, is probably, legal anyway, would be probably about sixteen.	probably
78249:90	i think 0 the, the minimum age for diving is, is probably, legal anyway, would be probably about sixteen.	probably
78254:29	eleven or twelve, i would think *t*-1, probably	probably
78255:9	but, maybe fifteen even.	maybe
78292:79	i guess 0 my favorite vacation idea would be * to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep *t*-1 maybe, you know, like a, a small camper.	maybe
78298:7	but maybe a pickup with the back on,	maybe
78339:23	and i would like *-1 to maybe not take great long trips, but, but have your home base, where your home is *t*-2 and then just travel out for, like, maybe, oh, a month, maybe go,	maybe
78339:110	and i would like *-1 to maybe not take great long trips, but, but have your home base, where your home is *t*-2 and then just travel out for, like, maybe, oh, a month, maybe go,	maybe
78339:127	and i would like *-1 to maybe not take great long trips, but, but have your home base, where your home is *t*-2 and then just travel out for, like, maybe, oh, a month, maybe go,	maybe
78386:82	i i think 0 right, right now while my husband and i don't have any kids we'll probably take as many vacations as we can *?* * doing things like scuba diving and, and adventurous types of things,	probably
78786:24	if i did understand politics i probably would vote more,	probably
78874:34	and if they don't say yes or no, then maybe somebody *ich*-1 will vote for them that *t*-2 wouldn't have *?* if they had come down on the wrong side.	maybe
78985:25	uh, i've been recycling for maybe about two years now and, at ano-, ano-, another public facility where they have, you know, recycling of glass, uh, aluminum and paper *t*-1.	maybe
79104:13	uh, now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they can't use *t*-1,	maybe
79159:83	i think, i think * helping us be more enthu-, enthusiastic about it, helping us maybe, maybe using the money for something special that *t*-1 would be like * paying off the national debt.	maybe
79159:91	i think, i think * helping us be more enthu-, enthusiastic about it, helping us maybe, maybe using the money for something special that *t*-1 would be like * paying off the national debt.	maybe
79316:21	quite a long time, uh, probably five or six years	probably
79438:57	and he said, uh, a booster, uh, every year or two, i mean, maybe every six months or, or something like that	maybe
79456:38	like i think 0 german shepherds *ich*-1 do it, and probably large dogs.	probably
79530:10	oh, definitely.	definitely
79558:15	i think 0 maybe we have *?*,	maybe
79564:10	oh, definitely.	definitely
79585:26	and i think 0 it's been probably about five and a half minutes or something.	probably
79623:10	and * probably just got home.	probably
79652:60	but my husband had been ma-, in fact, he's been, probably has made a few more calls than i have *?* because i tend *-1 to not make them around dinner time,	probably
79663:8	well maybe i'll get you next time.	maybe
79709:31	i use them mostly for big things, like maybe, sometimes, uh, tuition if it's, you know, if i'm short, *-2 to go ahead and get it and then try *-1 to get it saved *-3 back as quick as i can *?*.	maybe
79816:14	even before it probably wasn't *?*, though, because you didn't get anywhere near as much as what it, you didn't get *-3 to claim anywhere near what you ended up *-2 paying *t*-1.	probably
80239:16	it's probably, i would think 0 it would be hard on your, your legs and your joints and stuff.	probably
80268:10	at least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could *?*	maybe
80320:24	and i'm thinking about * maybe sponge painting them. either that or * maybe rag rolling. to give it kind of a country look.	maybe
80320:48	and i'm thinking about * maybe sponge painting them. either that or * maybe rag rolling. to give it kind of a country look.	maybe
80380:11	because you might find that it's beyond, uh, what you're willing *-2 to put *t*-1 into it. although i think 0 it could turn out really nice.	might
80457:24	if it's paper it will probably shred.	probably
80459:48	um, in one bathroom it's, um, it's probably paper, uh,	probably
80480:121	well i, i've also been *-4 thinking about, after * looking at all these magazines, um, these design magazines and stuff, i'm thinking about maybe *-1 painting the bedroom walls too, in a color that *t*-2 will kind of, um, tie in our, um, our, um, our, uh, comforter, with a color that *t*-3's kind of a, um, burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design.	maybe
80488:20	i don't know if maybe i'm biting off more than i can chew *?*.	maybe
80494:16	well the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting.	probably
80568:24	well if i were closer i might *?*.	might
80606:65	and i, i feel that the, the only legitimate paper, although it might sound, a little elitist is the new york times.	might
80753:33	they ju-, they really are probably the worse papers 0 i've ever read *t*-1.	probably
81047:11	i've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times.	probably
81186:19	because we saw it, probably, four or five months ago.	probably
81443:26	well i, i certainly hope so.	certainly
81458:11	ours is probably the closest to it.	probably
81469:42	the only thing about mine, um, i think 0 there's probably about, oh,	probably
81472:43	but they're spaced *-1 out, oh i'd say *ich*-2 maybe three, on a two block period.	maybe
81517:5	maybe someday when i feel really ambitious and an-, get angry *t*-2 i'll start *-1 poking holes up there,	maybe
81521:96	ninety, i would say 0 about, oh, about ninety-five percent, no i guess 0 may-, probably a hundred percent of them all are mostly brick, uh, with some wood.	probably
81547:17	so you're just as likely *-1 to fl-, wake up and discover 0 you're in two inches of water.	likely
81703:15	i mean, maybe, one snow.	maybe
81908:11	it's probably a lot worse now.	probably
81973:9	so, maybe that's part of the reason 0 it's not so bad down here *t*-1.	maybe
82671:55	well, i, i've been, uh, i have probably had more time than you have *?* 0 * to think about this subject *t*-1,	probably
82690:16	uh, we're probably making a comparison against, uh, some european and, uh, and, uh, uh, s-s-say, newer republics that, uh, that *t*-1 have very high percentages.	probably
82708:49	my solution to that is that we hold it on sundays. as do probably sixty to seventy percent of the european countries now.	probably
82785:8	well maybe that is another factor, the motivational factor.	maybe
82786:15	the motivational factor is probably...	probably
82948:7	and maybe he will *?*.	maybe
83015:30	so, if you really computed it, they probably	probably
83092:142	uh, i think that the judges should be left *-1 to do most of the sentencing, simply because, uh, there is always, uh, there is, there is always a jury that *t*-2 might be swayed *-3, uh, by the moment, uh, * to either to be too lenient or too vengeful, i guess 0 *t*-5.	might
83119:18	you know, that might be it.	might
83120:33	i mean, they, they certainly,	certainly
83144:8	you might be right about that.	might
83254:25	but there, there definitely is, uh, uh, you know, to me the, one of the worst things that *t*-1 could ever happen, uh, from what i read and see and understand *t*-2.	definitely
83315:59	i mean, just because you feel like he was being kicked on, which he certainly was *t*-1, you know.	certainly
83345:5	maybe when you are there in the r-, in the courtroom yourself and you are sitting there and you have got *-1 to make a judgment on somebody *t*-2.	maybe
83347:7	or maybe the evidence was not as sensational as the media presented it *?*.	maybe
83352:8	that might be it.	might
83426:8	they probably built that in so they could make money.	probably
83509:26	i've only taken, uh, maybe two trips that *t*-1 were about four hours long dow-, uh, down to shreveport.	maybe
83567:27	and, uh, i've done it maybe twelve times.	maybe
83583:30	i, i figured 0 maybe i'd get one or two years out of it,	maybe
83598:26	i think 0 those old cars might, might be a pretty good bet because you,	might
83598:34	i think 0 those old cars might, might be a pretty good bet because you,	might
83680:55	i mean, it, it was pro-, probably was up to your shoulder in, in thistles.	probably
83688:19	and i have since then probably ripped out half of what he has done *t*-1 because it has always been incorrectly planted *-2	probably
83692:130	and so i am kind of at this point getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going *-1 to do *t*-2 is 0 we are just going *-3 to struggle through the rest of this year, probably through the fall too. and, uh, rip up, rip out all the rest of these junipers or anything that *t*-4 requires, uh, more care than i am willing * to give the kids *t*-5 and replace it with hollies.	probably
83809:11	i have probably planted, oh, around here, um, maybe six hundred bulbs.	probably
83809:38	i have probably planted, oh, around here, um, maybe six hundred bulbs.	maybe
83814:15	i have probably have done hyacinths.	probably
83995:60	because i have got a flower, i have got, i have probably got, do, do, do, do, i do not know how many square feet it is *t*-1, a big circular driveway.	probably
84149:18	that is, uh, probably enough * to see.	probably
84333:10	oh, definitely.	definitely
84339:14	i think so definitely.	definitely
84545:10	and i probably got more nasty than i should have *?*.	probably
84713:11	that is probably one of the most bizarre 0 i have heard of *t*-1.	probably
84743:106	and we've always, uh, oh tried *-1 to take our children and no-, now at this age our grandchildren to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able *-3 to *?* *t*-2.	might
84768:8	it certainly does, because, uh, you know, the things in the books seem so dead to the kids, you know, unless they've actually been there or whatever,	certainly
84933:26	and, and, we certainly turned into an air conditioned society.	certainly
85011:5	certainly we don't even need a, need a research anymore.	certainly
85168:42	well, i, i, d-, definitely advance that.	definitely
85453:87	this is called *-1 the, the, the country, you know, with only, you know, maybe twenty miles total from d c, twenty-five from the city.	maybe
85579:31	i mean, you know, we can maybe help them a little bit, prompt them,	maybe
85584:21	and, and maybe this is too general,	maybe
85596:58	i, i guess 0, you know, i'd like you to maybe express something here.	maybe
85619:13	the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there	certainly
85634:17	and i think 0 maybe it's at a whole different level of them trying *-1 to cooperate and get along.	maybe
85810:17	so i assume that probably the total cove-, cost is probably, three fifty to four hundred.	probably
85810:44	so i assume that probably the total cove-, cost is probably, three fifty to four hundred.	probably
85813:11	they're probably picking up about half of it.	probably
85823:198	or one of, whatever the type name is *t*-1, h m o, uh, where the, uh, where you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest *t*-3. if you tried *-2 to buy something like that, i'm prob-, it would probably be five or six hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something.	probably
86169:41	and you also get in *-2 to see things that you might not get into *t*-1 if you were alone, uh,	might
86215:29	if you don't like wildlife it's probably not of interest.	probably
86329:5	maybe it was about a thousand dollars, maybe a little bit less, i don't really remember, for ten days including all my meals, a guide, a car, the airfare	maybe
86329:28	maybe it was about a thousand dollars, maybe a little bit less, i don't really remember, for ten days including all my meals, a guide, a car, the airfare	maybe
86589:11	it would definitely be gun control.	definitely
86657:22	one of these days my grandkids probably.	probably
86716:15	and, i was probably about twelve at the time,	probably
86824:50	i am not even, i am not even convinced *-3 that maybe things like football, hockey and, th-, th-, the, you know, the, and even baseball games now where the, everything is settled *-2 with a fight *t*-1.	maybe
87405:56	you know, the bourgeoisie was, was, was definitely out of, uh, style, then.	definitely
87481:13	and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly.	probably
87606:99	so i'm no-, i'm, uh, think that the, we really ought *-1 to seriously consider what an income tax might do *t*-2 that, uh, for texas	might
87635:74	and, and * realizing that that, that, that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to, uh, *-1 to go for that, because we supported the,	might
87657:21	that would provide, uh, possibly some relief there * to utilize some of the property taxes for other things *t*-2, see.	possibly
87687:105	but all the various taxing authorities that *t*-1 come through, i think 0 the one tax 0 i resent *t*-4 the most though is the additional sales tax for dart which *t*-2 is probably never going *-3 to be in existence in my lifetime.	probably
87780:21	i think 0 that will probably do it,	probably
87845:10	but you might not be so you know, so encouraging, of susan sarandon and then gena davis when they do it *t*-1.	might
87862:127	because that, that just reminds me of, you know, like back in school and, you know, the girlfriends just taking off for a day or something. just getting in trouble and probably not that much trouble	probably
87951:11	that's probably the last movie 0 i saw *t*-1. um, dances with wolves,	probably
87957:40	um, a couple years ago, i guess, well, maybe ten years ago i, i had read * bury my heart at wounded knee	maybe
87994:10	so there possibly were because you know 0 you always have conflict in the world.	possibly
88082:26	maybe i-, well, maybe that was, um,	maybe
88135:73	um, i rented a good movie, um, called * cinema paradeso which *t*-1 is an italian movie which *t*-3 is probably the best movie 0 i've seen *t*-2 ever.	probably
88205:21	i'm guessing 0 you probably do.	probably
88355:11	that's probably where you've used it *t*-1.	probably
88428:24	although i think 0 we've probably been talking at least ten minutes	probably
88510:28	well, those are skills that she certainly w-, is going *-1 to need *t*-2 early on	certainly
88851:21	there were a hundred schools, probably there all competing for the same kids.	probably
88886:51	but, uh, it seemed like there were quite a few kids that *t*-1 were definitely interested in *-2 going there.	definitely
88922:32	well you know i think 0 richardson is probably you know one of the places that *t*-1 would definitely	probably
88922:67	well you know i think 0 richardson is probably you know one of the places that *t*-1 would definitely	definitely
89266:12	and someday, maybe, we might even own it,	maybe
89266:20	and someday, maybe, we might even own it,	might
89286:30	before that we lived in garland, uh, probably about, you know, four blocks away.	probably
89300:13	it could not possibly have gone any lower	possibly
89321:9	but, maybe not in your area,	maybe
89427:29	so, i think 0 the high end is definitely, you know somewhere there.	definitely
89441:10	now, maybe, you know, that's pretty close to what it would have sold for *t*-1, uh, * brand new,	maybe
89547:103	and, uh, the idea of * ever owning anything that *t*-1 has four thousand square feet in it, for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars, which *t*-2 is probably about what their equity *ich*-6 is *t*-3, that they got *t*-4 out of *-5 selling their house.	probably
89568:18	he has no insulation, probably.	probably
89634:107	and, and, uh, my father bought this, uh, my stepfather bought this *-1 thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care *t*-2	might
89756:13	and he was definitely,	definitely
89946:77	and even, and even then he, he had a very good case for the fact 0 they probably just got lost *-1 and they ditched in the water.	probably
89948:20	and, uh, it's probably, you know, real close to what, you know, everyone is thinking *t*-1, now that, they just got turned *-2 around and could not find their way back.	probably
90017:71	and she had, before it actually got big, she sent me this book *-1 saying, you might like this,	might
90187:18	or is this something that maybe * learning phonetics,	maybe
90351:18	i know 0 steven probably would not be accepted *-1 because he has a learning disability and, into a private school. and, um, which *t*-3 is, which *t*-2 is too bad.	probably
90388:117	the, in fact, they've had cases *ich*-1 in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten, which *t*-2 means 0 they probably won't get into the top elementary and, and high school *t*-3,	probably
90445:8	we certainly didn't carpool and run the way 0 i do *t*-1.	certainly
90636:44	is that just family's lack of priority, anymore, maybe	maybe
90771:10	so you probably could give some great advice.	probably
90828:30	i think 0 that's more important *ich*-1 probably than even the career vocation, because most people change.	probably
90836:168	i, i think 0 i'd, i'd advise a parent *-1 to send a kid to a school *ich*-2, though, that *t*-3 has a number of different types of programs, you know, that, uh, some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer *t*-1,	might
90862:38	i, i think 0 most employers would probably rather *ich*-1 hire, you know, a, a three six in, um, in history, uh, * to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration.	probably
90913:52	and i think 0 the kids are a little bit more challenged, because their parents are probably college educated, where at the public school, i don't think 0 as many parents are public, are, are college educated,	probably
90933:22	you know, a particular institution might be better for my area	might
90940:66	yet, like, say, you know, the university of small town in arkansas or something, might have some top specialists in my area.	might
90947:108	yet, if i go to u of i or c m u or, you know, some, you know, any big name school, my quality of education might not be that much better,	might
91243:63	i read a book that i have, should have read *t*-1 when i was probably in high school *t*-2.	probably
91421:25	and they just went from generation, probably to generation, just with these, with these all passing it from one to the other.	probably
91449:50	um, and i'm supposed *-1 to decide whether i think 0 this man might be a worthy person 0 *t*-2 to be a, you know, in that position on the board	might
91480:21	i think 0 that's probably a, sort of a thing 0 * to do *t*-1 in small colleges,	probably
91596:13	well, it might be a good time for you to be-, to, to start a tradition.	might
91687:46	well, we try *-1 to stay away from those things which *t*-2 might have, uh, salmonella in them.	might
91861:66	we had, uh, the first reunion, or the first, you know, major reunion was probably six or seven years ago.	probably
91865:31	and then the second reunion, people who *t*-1 maybe, you know, had sacrificed things * to come to the first one thought, oh, well, it's not that big a thing this year,	maybe
91907:10	so you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot?	probably
91957:13	so that's probably my favorite place when i have *-1 to go somewhere on a vacation *t*-2.	probably
92053:11	i'm probably going back there *-1 to work, for a year.	probably
92058:87	well, i had a friend that, uh, *t*-1 visited england not, well, i think 0 it's been *ich*-2 probably two years now,	probably
92307:40	it looks like, it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things. where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show *t*-1.	might
92388:10	and robots probably.	probably
92491:17	and i guess 0 maybe there are some parts of that,	maybe
92598:5	maybe you saw in the paper this morning that, um, they've had some problems with, the recycling on plastic,	maybe
92638:16	i was probably, this was probably,	probably
92638:30	i was probably, this was probably,	probably
92746:7	so maybe we don't realize it in our lifetime,	maybe
92971:27	i wonder if, you know, maybe i need *-1 to bring that to someone's attention, you know,	maybe
93101:10	and we probably take one of each every year.	probably
93240:26	we, we'd probably go.	probably
93377:27	huh. well, may, maybe now 0 things are calming down again. that will happen.	maybe
93425:17	not every morning, it probably averages about two days a week	probably
93487:36	so, i'm thirty-two years old which *t*-1 is probably different than yourself	probably
93563:52	so, running, i, i'm at that point which you probably get to *t*-1 after about six months of dedicated running where you don't feel your muscles any more *t*-2	probably
93687:32	well, may-, you know, maybe not.	maybe
93755:108	well, i, i, i guess 0 if i was having a dinner party i, depending on the number of people, i might cook a, like a brisket or a roast or a, maybe a chicken dish	might
93755:159	well, i, i, i guess 0 if i was having a dinner party i, depending on the number of people, i might cook a, like a brisket or a roast or a, maybe a chicken dish	maybe
93759:33	and, um, i guess 0 i usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a, a potato dish,	probably
93942:60	i guess 0 they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant *t*-1 maybe.	maybe
93974:15	i thought 0 maybe that was the trick.	maybe
93976:8	that probably helps, too.	probably
94039:26	well, i guess 0 that's probably all 0 we need *-1 to do *t*-2 for tonight.	probably
94059:17	probably, probably the only family recipe that we, we make *t*-1 and it's really for special occasions is cheese cake,	probably
94064:11	it's probably fairly typical,	probably
94167:30	well, i guess, um, 0 ours probably isn't that big.	probably
94436:99	and, uh uh, i think that that part of that showing up now, you know, with, with things because kids i think have probably less respect than for, for people than in, in other things, than we may have seen in the past, uh,	probably
94471:89	you look at the schools like that where you've got a lot of kids who *t*-1 are basically, uh, that *t*-2 might be more well to-, well off, you know, going to a private catholic school or whatever *t*-3, uh,	might
94492:14	and, uh, maybe they pick up on that.	maybe
94496:27	and then from the other aspect, um, maybe the, uh, school itself has, has, has more emphasis on, uh, *-1 trying *-2 to do a good job because the classes may be smaller, uh,	maybe
94622:232	* seeing the children in the school the way 0 i do *t*-1, i, i mean, i see the ones that, we can always tell the ones that *t*-2 have not been around children at all when they come in as three year olds *t*-6 as opposed to the ones that *t*-3 have been in the program, that *t*-4 started at twelve months maybe, and were were even in there one day a week which *t*-5 is all 0 our school provides *t*-7 for the, you know for the under three year olds	maybe
94678:12	that *t*-1 maybe,	maybe
94682:13	that *t*-2 maybe have another salary in their family that, where they can do that *t*-1,	maybe
94985:16	three eight six twenty-five c maybe	maybe
95177:16	well, it's probably the granddaddy of most, uh, data base management systems.	probably
95200:7	but certainly comparable.	certainly
95273:13	i mean maybe it's, uh,	maybe
95307:28	and that, i think, is even probably more widely *ich*-2 abused *-1 by, you know, the masses than, than drugs, so * to speak.	probably
95406:40	and i guess 0 you'd report that to a supervisor, maybe anonymously or something because i, i would feel very uncomfortable *-1 working with someone 0 i knew 0 *t*-2 was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol,	maybe
95534:10	and i probably re-, rebelled against it.	probably
95537:8	i probably should have kept one.	probably
95559:13	and i will probably ke-, start *-1 keeping a little better, track of it.	probably
95577:29	so, i think 0 it *exp*-1 is probably better * to have some sort of a, a, at least a record	probably
95635:105	i guess 0 it would have been, i will take that back, it must have been in the forties, because they had been married, uh, probably fifteen years at the time.	probably
95729:25	and, i think 0 that is probably what *t*-1 happened in our house	probably
95748:39	if it had not been for my wife, i would have probably been in debtor's prison, if we had one.	probably
95934:30	as far as, maybe, maybe as the summer heat comes along i would sort of like *-1 going somewhere where it's not so hot *t*-2. and being able *-3 to be outside, enjoy outsor-, outside activities,	maybe
95934:38	as far as, maybe, maybe as the summer heat comes along i would sort of like *-1 going somewhere where it's not so hot *t*-2. and being able *-3 to be outside, enjoy outsor-, outside activities,	maybe
96108:48	it will take, uh, a day and a half * to get there, probably.	probably
96152:30	so, anyway, so maybe, maybe within a year, we will see how that falls *t*-1.	maybe
96152:38	so, anyway, so maybe, maybe within a year, we will see how that falls *t*-1.	maybe
96156:47	we will head for, we will head for florida, maybe in somewhat of an off season, instead of summer.	maybe
96164:16	well, that's probably ne-, all 0 we need *-1 to do *t*-2 today.	probably
96306:10	oh, definitely,	definitely
96307:4	definitely.	definitely
96383:12	so, she definitely entering into, uh, a male profession.	definitely
96419:68	but, uh, that is one area where it, that i can see 0 *t*-1 might change, but i really doubt 0 *t*-1 will change.	might
96428:5	probably not.	probably
96573:10	but i probably talked to seven or eight people.	probably
96660:11	we are certainly not *?*,	certainly
97180:29	uh, and, and i might,	might
97196:17	but, uh, i might start *-1 to go crazy with it too.	might
97234:55	maybe if i needed *-1 to work part time, like four hours a day, i might do that, cause like, you should get enough stimulation from you the rest of the time.	might
97243:54	and if not, the infant is going *-1 to lay in the crib all day, and maybe have a mobile *ich*-2 above it 0 * to play with *t*-3.	maybe
97310:13	and i will probably be going back to work around january, whereas she will be about, eight or nine months old.	probably
97324:10	so you might have a real problem with that.	might
97360:85	it would, if they were where i could not get my hands on them *t*-1, i am afraid 0 i would probably go crazy.	probably
97376:28	well, if i work part time that might be doable.	might
97407:22	and, you know, * maybe do some free lance type work at home.	maybe
97426:20	and so, uh, she might be able *-1 to do it a couple of hours a day	might
97427:22	and we cou-, might even be able *-1 to do it on a trade off basis. that i watch, their baby when they want *-2 to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever *t*-4, or if she wants an afternoon off. even if she wants an afternoon 0 * just to work. uh, and not be bothered *t*-5,	might
97441:8	we might be able *-1 to exchange that way.	might
97473:13	and it's probably my fault, because i do not have a real schedule now.	probably
97743:16	i think 0 probably is as enlightened as anyone can be *?* at this particular stage in their life time.	probably
97881:29	i, i'm guessing probably an hour and forty-five minutes, maybe.	probably
97881:47	i, i'm guessing probably an hour and forty-five minutes, maybe.	maybe
98150:16	well, i've certainly enjoyed *-1 talking with you.	certainly
98178:11	there are certainly parts of town 0 i would not want *-1 to live in *t*-2.	certainly
98236:42	uh, well, if we have one murder a year that's probably as many,	probably
98256:18	i think 0 they definitely have more problems that, uh, in, in the area.	definitely
98303:37	i think 0 they, the drug culture definitely has, uh, is one of the main problems.	definitely
98326:11	it would certainly be an interesting test	certainly
98345:16	i mean they probably became weakened physically *ich*-1 and other things to the point that their life expectancy was real short *t*-2,	probably
98361:31	i, uh, i would certainly like *-1 to see a real test of, of * making drugs real cheap * to see if when you make them available *t*-2 people then don't use them.	certainly
98518:47	uh, but then when you quantify things *t*-3 and that might also hold criminal trials for how many years *t*-1 is appropriate, uh, that they might leave it to somebody else who, uh, *t*-2 has expertise in that.	might
98518:97	uh, but then when you quantify things *t*-3 and that might also hold criminal trials for how many years *t*-1 is appropriate, uh, that they might leave it to somebody else who, uh, *t*-2 has expertise in that.	might
98540:37	and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three.	might
98559:22	i mean, it *exp*-4 might be more important for them * to put a sen-, sen-, sentencing *ich*-5 *ich*-2 down that *t*-1 was, uh, longer, you know, that didn't fit, the punishment didn't fit the crime *t*-3.	might
98568:147	the only thing 0 i worry about *t*-1 sometimes is if, if you get somebody *ich*-5 *ich*-6 in there that, that *t*-2 has a name, that *t*-3 is the defendant and, you know, sometimes, might have more pull, which *t*-4 that does happen.	might
98633:17	uh, such like, maybe in murder they get *-1 to choose whether it's, uh, premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees.	maybe
98710:32	so i'll be, i'll probably be wearing slacks as often as i do because i'm, i'm, if i'm going *-1 to be down on the floor *-2 messing with them, i'm not going *-3 to wear nylons and, you know nice nylons and dresses.	probably
98712:71	well, what i wear *t*-1 sometimes depends on, on how cold i think 0 the school might be *t*-2 or what room i might be in *t*-3 since i'm a sub, and have different rooms 0 * to go to *t*-4. and always carry a sweater.	might
98712:92	well, what i wear *t*-1 sometimes depends on, on how cold i think 0 the school might be *t*-2 or what room i might be in *t*-3 since i'm a sub, and have different rooms 0 * to go to *t*-4. and always carry a sweater.	might
98745:65	and, and in the winter, you know, i just add a, maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than i do in the summer. and add a heavier jacket or, you know, wear jackets more *ich*-1 in the winter than i do in the summer.	maybe
98762:10	and one might be a hat day where you have *-1 to come up with some sort of hat *t*-2.	might
98769:57	but because i sort of stick to several schools, uh, i'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and, and might, might remember *-1 to do it.	might
98769:94	but because i sort of stick to several schools, uh, i'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and, and might, might remember *-1 to do it.	might
98769:99	but because i sort of stick to several schools, uh, i'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and, and might, might remember *-1 to do it.	might
98774:53	and then many schools on a particular day during, uh, i guess football season, maybe all year long, they wear the school colors for, uh, game day which,	maybe
98783:8	it might be thursday for the high schools	might
98813:29	i think 0 the elementary school teachers, or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than, than some of the high school teachers, i think.	maybe
98832:52	and they'll just wear your common, ordinary, you know, whatever you might might say *t*-2,	might
98832:58	and they'll just wear your common, ordinary, you know, whatever you might might say *t*-2,	might
98843:23	and so you try *-1 to maybe follow those if you know 0 you're going there,	maybe
98860:24	some of those male coaches, that might really,	might
98908:20	i think, 0 really probably, they could, they could, uh, really,	probably
98927:8	it certainly makes it *exp*-1 easier * to dress.	certainly
98934:20	well, it *exp*-2's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run, i think, that you don't have *-1 to be concerned about your wardrobe.	certainly
99066:59	and, uh, one thing that i did *t*-1 this summer, which i thought 0 *t*-2 might benefit both my daughters is, 0 my youngest daughter got involved *-3 in band,	might
99087:22	uh, my parents, uh, certainly didn't push but wanted me to look in the south	certainly
99088:52	and because i had been in a small school, they suggested that i probably, i,	probably
99093:23	and so they suggested that i might want a smaller school because i was used to a lot of one-on-one uh, or small group situations.	might
99095:10	oh, definitely.	definitely
99132:40	uh, and really his, his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand.	probably
99147:10	and i definitely felt like i was a number.	definitely
99161:31	well, th-, that's certainly,	certainly
99226:30	well, the weather has been, certainly has been hot	certainly
99245:10	but it certainly, uh,	certainly
99301:8	it might rain on your little parade.	might
99325:8	you probably know where that is *t*-1 because i know where pontiac is *t*-2,	probably
99392:20	you know, like maybe a mile, two long.	maybe
99408:13	so it's probably out in that direction,	probably
99409:29	but that's the only one 0 i probably could name *t*-1 after all these years	probably
99427:27	i was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from, from the city limits	maybe
99480:39	so but, uh, you know, we probably did some ice skating on it,	probably
99681:30	and i was thinking, you know 0 maybe i'd help *-1 supplement it, you know when they turned them in *t*-2	maybe
99770:20	proba-, we probably will *?*.	probably
99798:48	and, uh, when you read that *t*-1 you think, well gee, maybe it is a big deal, you know.	maybe
99955:9	and, probably the first question would be whether you've ever had *-1 to go through that process.	probably
100061:7	or probably in college station there wasn't a whole lot of choice.	probably
100166:19	in fact, that's probably what *t*-1's going *-2 to happen with my husband's mother.	probably
100167:43	she's going *-1 to endanger herself before she'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision.	probably
100271:17	so we thought 0 maybe we could get them to move a little closer here.	maybe
100319:25	and and it would certainly help the country, too, uh.	certainly
100326:21	i think 0 that's probably like, uh, quite a few things that, that the kids, uh, maybe not so much nowadays but used *-1 to go through *t*-2, you know,	probably
100326:77	i think 0 that's probably like, uh, quite a few things that, that the kids, uh, maybe not so much nowadays but used *-1 to go through *t*-2, you know,	maybe
100348:11	that's probably true. you know	probably
100352:63	but even, even through those groups, do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used *-1 to *?*?	maybe
100363:21	i think 0 that's probably true.	probably
100367:21	i think 0 it's probably more true *ich*-1 *ich*-2, still in the, in the smaller communities then in the larger cities.	probably
100411:11	and maybe, uh, maybe this would be a way 0 * to get that feeling back *t*-1. um, if we've lost some of that	maybe
100411:24	and maybe, uh, maybe this would be a way 0 * to get that feeling back *t*-1. um, if we've lost some of that	maybe
100413:5	maybe that's a way,	maybe
100414:50	if, if young people had *-1 to do it um, maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things 0 i always thought 0 *t*-2 was a wonderful part of our country. um, is * helping others.	maybe
100446:31	you know, i think 0 this is certainly a possible way, um, 0 * to handle it *t*-1	certainly
100466:11	that's probably true.	probably
100467:11	that's probably true.	probably
100710:8	it certainly is *?*.	certainly
101608:39	and, and, you know, basically it certainly a l-, low calorie, you know, good thing except then you put your mayonnaise in there and spoil the whole thing.	certainly
101715:26	well, i think 0 we've probably talked long enough	probably
101764:8	i definitely,	definitely
101858:121	and, i, i think that if they didn't *?* that, and it became more of the standard * not to *?* that, uh, i don't know maybe companies would start *-1 paying men more so that their wives could stay home. you know? and have a more solid, uh, foundation for the kids.	maybe
101868:46	like you said, i mean, there's, they might be saving money,	might
101898:9	or, maybe there's a small need for money	maybe
101963:7	and maybe part of that is * educating parents better.	maybe
102041:17	and, uh, we probably go out one to two times a week.	probably
102153:17	but we've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons, and the other half through the, through the newspaper reviews.	probably
102260:11	i would probably like that.	probably
102354:13	but i go maybe once every couple of months.	maybe
102616:27	my parents took me when i was probably somewhere between ashley and jamie's age *t*-1.	probably
103056:74	i think, uh, 0 air isn't as bad *ich*-1 0 it once was *?*, from the cars, because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area.	certainly
103172:63	it's just, you know, a possible solution in the future, i think 0 *t*-1, * maybe to help in some ways.	maybe
103192:80	i, i think, 0 with * solving some of the energy, future energy problems, we'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well.	probably
103284:15	you know, maybe there is *?*,	maybe
103466:7	and maybe that's why, one of the reasons why crime has gone up *t*-1, because it's not so scary anymore.	maybe
103511:115	but i, i really think that in, in terms of like this, i'd, i think that it, it might not be such a bad thing. because, i don't know that anybody, w-, in-, i don't know that anybody would feel good, you know, like if you let someone like that loose in your community.	might
103515:10	well, maybe if they could, uh, if they had more money or more, more resources 0 * to work more on rehabilitation *t*-1,	maybe
103525:10	uh, probably the favorite instrument would be, uh, the violin.	probably
103535:171	i guess 0 i enjoy, i enjoy jazz, * listening to jazz sometime although i don't feel like i have a good, g-, good understanding of it, or a good, a good feel for maybe what *t*-1's good jazz and what *t*-2's not,	maybe
103884:10	well, maybe they don't.	maybe
104004:31	they'd be, i don't know, maybe ten ounce or six ounce or ten ounce. sort of a small size, sort of a small size	maybe
104030:7	but certainly we were doing things the way 0 we think 0 we should do them now *t*-1.	certainly
104073:13	but it's certainly usable material.	certainly
104093:52	but, uh, you know, the last movies that i've seen *t*-1 were probably on video.	probably
104208:15	i guess 0 maybe it would have been better if we'd have been at the theater as opposed to, uh, * just at the house watching it with, with no one else around.	maybe
104295:18	i thought 0 that might be kind of fun 0 * to do *t*-1.	might
104364:64	--ing seems *-1 to be a, a topic that *t*-2's going *-3 to probably take about a generation *ich*-5 *-4 to, uh, catch on, it seems 0 *t*-6, or maybe a generation to two.	probably
104364:123	--ing seems *-1 to be a, a topic that *t*-2's going *-3 to probably take about a generation *ich*-5 *-4 to, uh, catch on, it seems 0 *t*-6, or maybe a generation to two.	maybe
104402:29	i read in the paper this week where maybe,	maybe
104404:15	i guess 0 maybe this week someone may start *-1 getting them if the truck that *t*-2 picks them up is outfitted *-3 in time.	maybe
104408:51	but, it, it should be starting, i would stay probably in the next month if, if everything goes that,	probably
104480:44	i, i think 0 kids don't appreciate, maybe the value of money, that it's so little that they don't care,	maybe
104489:41	the nickels, the dimes or what, i suppose 0 it might be quarters, fifty cent pieces in these days, that they would get *t*-1, they, the kids just don't seem *-2 to, to care that, that much about a small amount of money.	might
104497:40	so i would say 0 in the last three years, we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before.	probably
104511:63	since we've had the crusher all summer, we, i guess 0 we just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't ta-,	maybe
104512:102	oh, i think 0 the kids, when we were on vacation *t*-1, they said 0 they did take them to a, a recycling place, probably at one of the li-,	probably
104550:33	i find that, uh, about two years is probably my max on * subscribing to one in particular	probably
104581:30	and if something caught my eye, then i might read something,	might
104624:38	i can see that it will be a very long time, probably, before i subscribe to any magazines at home.	probably
104687:25	all right, i guess 0 we might as well end our conversation at this point.	might
104738:78	well, i, i kind of, i thought, well, that, that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing.	might
104794:109	but, we have such an affluent a-, society, society that i wonder if, if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a, a cure for just about everything.	might
104814:8	they certainly do well for those who *t*-1 go to the symphony orchestra and all that,	certainly
104848:5	probably just for our own safety when we're traveling and things *t*-2 that would be something 0 i'd like *-1 to know that *t*-3's going on.	probably
104953:45	because a lot of people, * seems like *t*-2, would probably obviously are trying *-1 to hide that uh, from their employer and friends and family and things	probably
105045:13	and it was maybe fifteen, twenty acres	maybe
105078:33	i'd kind of like, someday, *-1 to maybe end up on a pair of skis that, that *t*-2 doesn't have a, uh, well, what they call *t*-3 trick skis.	maybe
105096:5	maybe someday i'll, i'll get back to that as, after the kids are up and grown and the monies *ich*-2 are there 0 * to get away for times on end, weekend or something *t*-1.	maybe
105184:33	it, well, and that's probably,	probably
105207:44	uh, so, well, if you're working, then you're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go *t*-1.	probably
105261:63	i would have *-1 to say 0 we both end up *-2 going to las vegas, uh, probably once every maybe year and a half.	probably
105261:73	i would have *-1 to say 0 we both end up *-2 going to las vegas, uh, probably once every maybe year and a half.	maybe
105287:23	so we are thinking that we might go to las vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip.	might
105288:111	uh, when we normally go that way *t*-1, we like *-2 to go to california at the same time, because we really don't get out there as often as you could *?* probably from texas.	probably
105332:31	i would, i think probably not a, a brand new car,	probably
105333:7	but maybe something like a nissan sentra. or something like that, uh,	maybe
105365:34	i think 0 that's something 0 we might want *t*-1, too, is some kind of standard transmission *ich*-2 at least rather than automatic.	might
105370:11	we'll probably have *-1 to look for another second car sometime	probably
105372:22	s-, but probably real cheap, too.	probably
105382:25	prob-, well probably, probably that would be a good idea,	probably
105382:36	prob-, well probably, probably that would be a good idea,	probably
105418:35	but, uh, i feel that it's probably pre-, it's pretty good if, if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs.	probably
105444:64	and i think 0 just the idea that you know that you may be tested *-1 might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you're,	might
105454:35	is that how they do it at t i *t*-1 maybe.	maybe
105478:100	and it, it *exp*-1 is possible that, you know, that they can't do as good a job, uh, as they might do.	might
105602:65	i just, i didn't think 0 it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period	probably
105626:8	theirs might not run a thousand dollars.	might
105630:10	well, maybe they run,	maybe
105634:7	or maybe it's under a health type program that *t*-1 it it, it would catch a lot of things.	maybe
105755:32	and i'm about, uh, fifteen miles, probably, from downtown cleveland, something like that.	probably
105809:13	and you'll probably really, uh, re-, regain your enthusiasm for it once you get into a, a class again.	probably
106414:33	and, and then i'd have probably rolled it on.	probably
106422:24	well, the first time it'd probably would have taken me forever,	probably
106455:46	so now i feel like if i ever buy a house, i can probably paint, if nothing else.	probably
106457:21	i think 0 i could probably do it uh,	probably
106617:70	and we intend *-1 to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years, or next year probably.	probably
106697:28	i, i couldn't probably be bothered *-1 *-1 doing that every month,	probably
106749:91	and we're going *-1 to go ahead and try *-4 to just live on what we earn *t*-2 instead of *-5 guessing ahead of what we probably will have *t*-3 next month.	probably
106761:27	uh, there was a time when maybe we didn't take all of them off *t*-1,	maybe
106788:34	but i can't see that it would work for probably the majority of people.	probably
106792:36	you ma-, you probably have a little extra than you have *-1 to have *?*, *-2 to,	probably
106857:19	and you enjoyed it better probably.	probably
106877:21	i think 0 you're probably much ahead of me there	probably
106993:82	and, uh, they're, they're actually going *-1 to extend it, i think, one of these days maybe to apartment complexes	maybe
107084:13	and sometimes you might have two or three.	might
107264:10	well, maybe they didn't mention it because it's just kind of a fact of life around here.	maybe
107268:8	they probably just take it for granted then.	probably
107341:23	and i think 0 we'll probably experience some of your weather although i think 0 they have more humidity.	probably
107368:42	but, uh, and with children, um, you probably don't have time *ich*-2 anyhow 0 * to, to get into it *t*-1.	probably
107439:38	and i have often wondered if, if maybe that would help the situation.	maybe
107444:36	well, can you come up with anything else that maybe we could do *t*-1 to these people?	maybe
107454:54	um, one thing that i-, that i think probably one of the reasons that people don't vote more *t*-1 is because they don't know the candidates.	probably
107521:133	and sometimes it *exp*-1's nice * to be able * to go ahead of time and vote because, you know, if you're going *-2 to be tied up that day, uh, * campaigning or whatever it might be. um, 0 that kind of, just kind of takes that load off, you know,	might
107669:7	and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever *t*-1, i don't know what they're going *-2 to do *t*-3.	maybe
107678:45	so if my parents do need *-1 to live with someone, it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers *ich*-3 around and everything 0 * to care for *t*-2. you know,	probably
107733:7	and maybe they should *?*, you know because we're all going *-1 to get old someday.	maybe
107909:11	so you probably have a job 0 you need *-1 to get to *t*-2 pretty soon.	probably
107943:51	so, i'm going *-1 to be dressing just in casual slacks and t-shirts, probably not blue jeans, but little bit short of that, just, just tennis shoes and play clothes.	probably
107945:22	well, around there you can probably wear, uh, t-shirts and other things,	probably
108040:21	and she would not have even probably owned a pair of tennis shoes after she got out of high school,	probably
108163:47	i mean, if you want *-1 to go all time favorite show, probably one of them was little house on the prairie	probably
108228:10	uh, probably the pirates,	probably
108276:5	maybe they'll make it,	maybe
108313:71	like the wonder years, i, i mean, it's kind of risque stuff for, maybe for teenagers,	maybe
108484:57	you can't understand what they're saying *t*-1 on some of those songs which *t*-2 probably is just as well on some of them, too.	probably
108493:27	but i, i definitely, i really enjoy the fifties *rnr*-2, the sixties *rnr*-2 and a lot, some of the seventies *rnr*-2 rock and roll	definitely
108505:32	you know if it's informal i'd probably choose something, i mean, just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill because that's a lot of fun, especially this time of year where it's so nice out *t*-1.	probably
108515:29	um, if it was formal i'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something.	probably
108517:13	but i'd probably go with lasagna, a green salad, and garlic bread.	probably
108600:7	and probably some yogurt was in there.	probably
108688:10	well, maybe a little more leisure time 0 * to do it *t*-1.	maybe
108694:16	that's probably, that's true,	probably
108731:16	talk to you later maybe.	maybe
108829:43	so i think 0 that would be one thing 0 i would definitely consider *t*-1 * try *-6 to find a school within the state that, um, i liked *t*-3 well enough *-2 to attend.	definitely
108843:42	so depending on what your major is *t*-1, or medical, you might want *-2 to atteck-, some, um, attend somewhere like tech	might
108932:26	and, uh, something that *t*-1 might play a part is the size of the college.	might
108974:37	but i guess 0 some of the other smaller colleges might, might be a lot different.	might
108974:45	but i guess 0 some of the other smaller colleges might, might be a lot different.	might
108985:13	and i would definitely get my money's worth,	definitely
109234:18	we've been here probably two and a half years,	probably
109343:66	oh, when we first were, were here *t*-1, it was like we'd take maybe a, oh, a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full,	maybe
109343:103	oh, when we first were, were here *t*-1, it was like we'd take maybe a, oh, a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full,	maybe
109397:21	but, may, maybe they'll beat me and, and do the city wide first.	maybe
109435:7	and maybe we'll get on line again.	maybe
109717:27	it was redone *-1 at the time probably when earth tones were in *t*-2	probably
109797:26	but it does sound like it's definitely growing.	definitely
109825:41	we, at the time we thought 0 we might buy a mobile home,	might
109882:37	but i guess 0 more than anything i think 0 maybe people were just kind of wanting *-1 to have the choice of what they could do *t*-2, you know	maybe
109985:25	i can see where that would definitely hinder the problem *t*-1,	definitely
109986:4	definitely.	definitely
110042:17	and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds	probably
110080:35	we've, uh, we thought probably 0 our neighborhood in houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of, um, the family that *t*-1 had them and, and bred them.	probably
110208:15	um, but she might have some contacts here,	might
110258:111	but *-1 not being a teacher, as you are *?*, you know, i, i was not quite as sympathetic as, you know, as i probably would have been *?* if, if kay were a teacher or something.	probably
110289:51	you know, in those areas i really, you know, do believe that maybe we should clean up our, you know house.	maybe
110316:11	i'd probably feel the same way if i had *-2 to do that.	probably
110422:87	then, i think, you know, 0 if if it came, push came to shove, i'd probably be drug tested *-1 you know,	probably
110447:93	if it, if it's if it was true there, i'm sure it's true with just about probably to some degree every school 0 there is *t*-1	probably
110458:4	certainly not,	certainly
110459:4	certainly not,	certainly
110716:22	and i thought, that's probably a good idea because you really	probably
110763:15	i think 0 maybe we've given our teachers a almost impossible job.	maybe
111390:25	so there, there might be,	might
111477:10	so that might be why i look for inexpensive places *t*-1 just because we're eating out probably five nights a week maybe.	might
111477:58	so that might be why i look for inexpensive places *t*-1 just because we're eating out probably five nights a week maybe.	probably
111477:70	so that might be why i look for inexpensive places *t*-1 just because we're eating out probably five nights a week maybe.	maybe
111520:5	maybe we avoided wendy's the last few years because our daughter worked there	maybe
111584:11	he'd probably just like *-1 to stay home.	probably
111772:7	and possibly not, well,	possibly
111773:15	i guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt *-1, you know,	maybe
111774:31	if they release them two hours later, he probably doesn't deserve the death penalty,	probably
111923:22	but that's probably, i mean that's a good, that's a good sign.	probably
112039:21	you know, it would probably take my whole paycheck * just to go in and have one meal up there	probably
112320:32	and it's, it's certainly not at all common,	certainly
112472:59	but i was thinking, oh, my gosh, if they had very many babies, they couldn't possibly get them all out.	possibly
112487:11	that's certainly something 0 we hope 0 *t*-1 never happens.	certainly
112527:17	those are the, probably the bestes-, the best group 0 * to have *t*-1.	probably
112628:23	um, i need *-1 to definitely take a vacation where all, all 0 i do *t*-2 is * rest *t*-3.	definitely
112629:36	and i guess 0 *-2 to do that i'd probably have *-1 to take it at home.	probably
112674:8	you might be like i am *?*.	might
112806:79	and, uh, you know, i think 0 if i had, if i had the money, i would probably go to europe every year.	probably
112903:10	or i probably wouldn't have been there.	probably
112933:35	and if you want *-1 to see them, you might just as well enjoy football.	might
112970:13	but you'll probably always have a soft spot in your heart *ich*-1 though for for denver.	probably
113073:4	definitely.	definitely
113220:189	i think 0 if card cards were as, as stringent as say a, a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have *-1 to, you know, be able *-2 to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills *t*-4, we probably wouldn't have the problems 0 we have *t*-3.	probably
113327:21	i think 0 that would probably, uh, be very possible,	probably
113339:74	and in light of these, uh, hearings 0 we've all been sitting through *t*-1 the last two weeks, we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed.	definitely
113347:67	and the other thing is, uh, besides that 0 i think, uh, 0 two things that * very definitely need * looking at *t*-1, one is foreign aid.	definitely
113427:5	maybe if they ever get to the point	maybe
113433:122	if they were *-1 to take half of what they spend *t*-3 on that and put it on some economic, you know, inter-, intergovernmental or inter united states like programs that one really might *?*.	might
113477:11	we've probably been on long enough.	probably
113482:23	but i think 0 that will probably do it	probably
113572:5	maybe it should be, uh, well, it should be given *-1, you know, i, i won't say *rnr*-2 sparingly,	maybe
113619:67	and at that point you know i, i really think 0 there needs *-1 to be maybe a shorter appeal process.	maybe
113667:23	i think 0 the facts would probably back it up	probably
113696:11	or maybe, maybe theirs is, in fact, one year of military service for everyone.	maybe
113696:19	or maybe, maybe theirs is, in fact, one year of military service for everyone.	maybe
113762:10	maybe the, maybe it cou-, uh,	maybe
113762:21	maybe the, maybe it cou-, uh,	maybe
113809:21	and, and maybe that's why we have so many people in society who *t*-1 are not, uh, not really happy *t*-2, you know.	maybe
113823:40	but i-, it, it certainly seems to me that, that, uh, uh, things in, in the last twenty-three years, uh, things hav-, have definitely gone towards, uh, very much the concentration on self and, and loss of, loss of perspective in terms,	certainly
113823:151	but i-, it, it certainly seems to me that, that, uh, uh, things in, in the last twenty-three years, uh, things hav-, have definitely gone towards, uh, very much the concentration on self and, and loss of, loss of perspective in terms,	definitely
113968:106	that's, and i think 0 that's pretty crazy, because i mean those students who *t*-1 were in america when that was happening *t*-2 are almost certainly going *-3 to be in trouble if they go back,	certainly
113973:17	so it *exp*-1's certainly in our best selfish interest * to keep them here if we can *?*.	certainly
114175:8	* might as well buy me a new car for that.	might
114342:25	and i think that, that is probably the most aggravating.	probably
114396:33	well, that, yeah, that might,	might
114462:95	so i, i find myself being a l-, a bit abrupt and a little bit ruder than than i might normally be *?*	might
114553:53	and, you know, this isn't, you know, prob-, most likely not to, going * to be used *-1 against you,	likely
114626:7	but probably if i didn't have access to one all the time at work, i'd want one at home.	probably
114830:47	but they, uh, try *-1 to get as many people as they possibly can *?* to contribute to this	possibly
114842:13	well, i probably do because i've,	probably
114852:10	so i probably do.	probably
114869:8	i probably went through richardson, then.	probably
114871:8	you probably did.	probably
114980:35	i, i read one, like maybe once a year.	maybe
115105:4	definitely.	definitely
115161:16	and see that's probably all, all 0 i saw *t*-1.	probably
115181:9	and, maybe now that that's over they'll, they'll come out of it	maybe
115205:25	but, i think 0 chicago will probably with the n b a again.	probably
115213:11	they'll probably be pretty good.	probably
115225:11	it will certainly be different.	certainly
115268:8	we definitely will *?*.	definitely
115458:7	but maybe next year.	maybe
115490:21	sometimes i think 0 that might not be a bad idea.	might
115511:4	probably,	probably
115512:4	probably.	probably
115679:72	and, i'd say, well, i'm going *-1 to leave the boat out, because, uh, we'll probably do this again tomorrow.	probably
115702:11	it's probably the prettiest lake in the state of texas.	probably
115944:141	i think 0 *-1 living in richardson, we're kind of spoiled because i think 0 we get, we come closer to *-2 getting our money's worth as far as the city is concerned, i think than probably any, any city in the country.	probably
116140:10	but you definitely need *-1 to go to hawaii.	definitely
116141:6	very definitely.	definitely
116211:9	probably, maybe the rejuvenating cream is the only other thing 0 i would use *t*-1.	probably
116211:17	probably, maybe the rejuvenating cream is the only other thing 0 i would use *t*-1.	maybe
116281:8	you probably ski very well in utah.	probably
116436:15	i mean, certainly, you know, you can't just turn them loose in the middle of dallas,	certainly
116463:10	well, maybe that's the answer to crime is * getting more prosecution.	maybe
116491:79	well, i can see, you know, especially if you heard screams from a house or something, * not going over there maybe, because, you know, it could be dangerous,	maybe
116492:7	but certainly i can't understand * not calling the police.	certainly
116500:7	and probably one of the best things 0 we could do *t*-1 for crime is *-2 to participate ourselves in its prevention.	probably
116525:10	well, maybe this thing with, with the child at school, maybe that will make people think a bit more and, you know, take some steps *-1 to, to correct it.	maybe
116525:51	well, maybe this thing with, with the child at school, maybe that will make people think a bit more and, you know, take some steps *-1 to, to correct it.	maybe
116784:21	and we thought, well, maybe they work from, for dallas,	maybe
116956:38	at times i keep *-1 thinking, though, 0 that might be kind of nice.	might
117143:22	but since that happened, i certainly have *?*.	certainly
117210:28	and i think 0 they're probably, i think 0 it probably does these things or sur-, supposedly pretty good.	probably
117210:49	and i think 0 they're probably, i think 0 it probably does these things or sur-, supposedly pretty good.	probably
117235:15	i would gather probably from drugs.	probably
117487:20	and i think 0 we probably will *?* soon as the boys get a little bit older.	probably
117980:9	it probably slipped *-1 loose, didn't it?	probably
118200:29	but it's been that way for the last probably ten years.	probably
118317:66	and, um, i think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems.	maybe
118384:13	so this is probably a real hard subject for you.	probably
118542:39	i think i think 0 years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals, you know wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood.	maybe
118580:30	but now, you know, you wouldn't probably read about it here in texas	probably
118703:29	that, and, you know, maybe it's, maybe it *exp*-1's tough for a big powerful nation * to deal with, with, uh, countries like that that *t*-2 depend on us so much without *, you know, just telling them, running their country for them	maybe
118703:43	that, and, you know, maybe it's, maybe it *exp*-1's tough for a big powerful nation * to deal with, with, uh, countries like that that *t*-2 depend on us so much without *, you know, just telling them, running their country for them	maybe
118736:9	maybe i, maybe it's, you know, 0 i'm reflecting how i feel *t*-1 about it,	maybe
118736:20	maybe i, maybe it's, you know, 0 i'm reflecting how i feel *t*-1 about it,	maybe
118882:11	i'll probably always have a place here in richardson or dallas.	probably
118960:7	but maybe some day they can get closer,	maybe
119139:5	maybe i can learn something.	maybe
119195:27	uh, there's a lake like maybe two or three miles from here,	maybe
119218:23	i think 0 the lakes are probably different *ich*-1 in michigan than they are in texas.	probably
119273:16	they are *?*, definitely	definitely
119284:49	they can, they're, they're certainly ugly.	certainly
119288:11	it was probably four inches in diameter or something like that you know.	probably
119297:29	and it was so big, that it might not would have hurt us, but we sure felt like it was hurting us, *-1 just being there, you know.	might
119306:22	i think that, uh, probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else.	probably
119344:10	oh, definitely.	definitely
119372:83	i mean, i, i have a friend who, if she likes something, isn't sure what size somebody might need *t*-1, *t*-2 will buy it in every color and size and, you know, take everything back again.	might
119528:20	and i think 0 that certainly makes a difference from, back from the time when somebody handcrafted something *t*-1 and, you know, had some pride in it *t*-1.	certainly
119617:21	i think 0 it's definitely time for a change,	definitely
119640:75	and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel *t*-1, i think, uh, 0 *t*-2 we might have a, a lot better, a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed *-3.	might
119676:28	but, uh, unfortunately for him, but maybe fortunately for us, his health is not great,	maybe
119687:36	not as well as i would like *-1 to *?* probably	probably
119843:150	but, uh, it's, one of the reasons 0 the u s wasn't so, you know, didn't do more than they did *?* at the time *t*-1 because they weren't all that excited about him, although he's probably better than a lot of them,	probably
119873:60	but then again, so many people you got *-1 to understand only catch it once a day, maybe	maybe
119885:38	well, you know, i think 0 it probably could be, it always could be better,	probably
120176:9	and, maybe some day.	maybe
120446:47	we went fairly early in the season for this area, which *t*-1 is probably april is when we went *t*-2,	probably
120962:39	i mean, right now we're getting taxed *-1 probably, probably around thirty-five percent, or more.	probably
120962:49	i mean, right now we're getting taxed *-1 probably, probably around thirty-five percent, or more.	probably
120973:13	but there's probably at least about twenty-five to, to thirty cents of different taxes on, on our gas.	probably
121070:38	it's a plant that we've had *t*-1 for probably twenty-five years that these were cuttings off of *t*-2, you know.	probably
121281:59	i've, i'm sure 0 i watched it for more than that probably.	probably
121355:53	oh, see i, i, i watch it maybe twice a month,	maybe
121496:31	if i was having a dinner party i would probably, um, have some, um, some, uh, um, some fruit 0 * to start with *t*-1 with some apples sliced * up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and, um, probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some, uh, uh, salsa and chips *ich*-2 around and peanuts.	probably
121496:137	if i was having a dinner party i would probably, um, have some, um, some, uh, um, some fruit 0 * to start with *t*-1 with some apples sliced * up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and, um, probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some, uh, uh, salsa and chips *ich*-2 around and peanuts.	maybe
121496:168	if i was having a dinner party i would probably, um, have some, um, some, uh, um, some fruit 0 * to start with *t*-1 with some apples sliced * up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and, um, probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some, uh, uh, salsa and chips *ich*-2 around and peanuts.	probably
121496:173	if i was having a dinner party i would probably, um, have some, um, some, uh, um, some fruit 0 * to start with *t*-1 with some apples sliced * up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and, um, probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some, uh, uh, salsa and chips *ich*-2 around and peanuts.	maybe
121496:188	if i was having a dinner party i would probably, um, have some, um, some, uh, um, some fruit 0 * to start with *t*-1 with some apples sliced * up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and, um, probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some, uh, uh, salsa and chips *ich*-2 around and peanuts.	maybe
121498:23	so. um, i would have maybe, um,	maybe
121499:37	say if it was like greek night or something um, maybe, um, on the barbecue we'd put, uh, cubes of lamb or i guess lamb used * for greek. and, um, like a shish kabob, and, um, mushrooms and tomatoes and onions	maybe
121514:10	um, maybe some rolls and, um, i guess *t*-1 some, uh, some rice or something like that.	maybe
121688:5	maybe like four chicken breasts,	maybe
121695:46	and you take, um, s-, little bit, maybe two tablespoons of butter and a fr-, in a big frying pan. and chop up some onion and put in oregano and salt,	maybe
121763:21	they know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years.	probably
121835:31	but, uh, repeat, uh, crimes uh, maybe not the, the more mild ones but, you know, a more severe ones especially on, on armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people, and not just taking the money but beating them half to death *t*-1.	maybe
121934:21	so your privacy is invaded *-1 probably by other members of the family.	probably
121959:43	* try *-1 to remember *-2 to respect their privacy, and maybe they will respect yours	maybe
121986:37	i would get in the bathroom and lock the door so maybe they couldn't hear me,	maybe
122084:30	so when i first moved here *t*-1 i probably did consider that an invasion of privacy	probably
122104:21	i think 0 they would probably have *-1 to pull into my drive before it bothered me.	probably
122108:10	so that probably wouldn't bother me.	probably
122166:10	well, maybe you, uh, you have seen dances with wolves.	maybe
122302:10	oh, definitely.	definitely
122339:13	uh, that might be a lot 0 *t*-1 to do with it.	might
122408:36	i mean they do that now and they could probably lose their job.	probably
122451:9	where maybe a physics professor,	maybe
122460:32	e-, e-, maybe they should sit back and, and kind of, uh, decide on where the money's best spent *-1 *t*-2.	maybe
122465:7	and maybe they should be a little more, uh, uh, concerned with *-1 paying the right people *-2 to teach and, and be, uh, satisfied with maybe a little older school.	maybe
122465:102	and maybe they should be a little more, uh, uh, concerned with *-1 paying the right people *-2 to teach and, and be, uh, satisfied with maybe a little older school.	maybe
122474:29	and the other schools were built *-1 back in maybe the fifties or early sixties	maybe
122485:13	and it's probably fifty, sixty years old or, or better	probably
122528:11	it's probably up there to twenty now if i mumblex * to start again.	probably
122604:21	i'd say 0 we probably have within fifteen miles, twenty golf communities built * around courses that *t*-1 are pretty well designed and then of course, pine hurst	probably
122664:15	it's been probably five years since we've had any measurable snowfall.	probably
122722:13	but i'm probably getting a little too old for that.	probably
122724:65	well, i know if they make the advances that they have been making *t*-1, that, uh, maybe age will no longer, age or even physical, uh, abilities may not be, uh, a barrier anymore.	maybe
122775:15	i know 0 maybe some of the big things that, uh, uh,	maybe
122776:16	concentrated foods for one maybe	maybe
122887:8	you probably wouldn't have a pretty good list.	probably
122900:13	um, there certainly have been ideas surfaced *, uh, recently, uh, matter of fact repeatedly by many people	certainly
122974:28	oh, i, i definitely would *?*.	definitely
123237:23	he's he definitely, uh, is one of the best i think 0 *t*-1.	definitely
123342:20	but i think 0 it might be them.	might
123347:16	i would *?*, definitely.	definitely
123448:27	i mean, that's occurred *-1 certainly at times in the past,	certainly
123733:17	uh, i guess probably going on twenty years now.	probably
123810:7	and maybe we'll meet up again some time.	maybe
123883:8	it certainly is *?*.	certainly
123907:39	so in, in your area then there's probably a lot of, um, career type people that *t*-1 have those type homes	probably
123911:4	definitely.	definitely
123914:53	and, um, the area that we're settled *-1 in *t*-2 is, um, definitely young, young families with, with kids.	definitely
123951:13	uh, we definitely have a lot of trees here.	definitely
123973:46	and if you didn't do anything about it, then they *ich*-1'd probably the leaves just blow away.	probably
124005:71	i, i know that the amount of, or how far your dollar goes *t*-1 probably more than anything has, has greatly changed.	probably
124018:21	and even though the son was probably more successful, you know, higher up in the, the management ladder uh, his, he was actually making less money when you co-, when you go by costs of living *t*-1.	probably
124047:43	well, i, i know 0 gas prices have definitely jumped, uh, from, uh,	definitely
124104:4	definitely.	definitely
124152:5	maybe some day	maybe
124153:8	i probably won't be alive *-1 to see it,	probably
124154:10	but prices might go down lot more.	might
124236:29	but it was int-, it certainly was an exciting series, anyway.	certainly
124295:60	and he said 0 he's been saying one more, and it's been two and three, might be two and three more.	might
124321:36	but, he's, uh, he certainly is a good example, uh, for the kids.	certainly
124379:45	well, i think 0 it's, it's probably a combination of things.	probably
124386:42	and i think 0 that's, that's probably hurting us a little bit.	probably
124455:11	it'd probably be difficult anyway.	probably
124490:35	but that, that sounds like that might help *-1 solve that problem even on you know, old, old, uh, older stoves that *t*-2 don't have any kind of e p a requirements on them.	might
124494:8	that might help a little bit, especially in some places.	might
124512:20	and in the summer time we probably get yours.	probably
124582:13	but it's probably going *-1 to take me longer, because i didn't decide *-2 to major in that until, uh, about a year and a half after i was already in school,	probably
124731:69	even if you don't have your major decided on *, * have an idea what you think 0 you might want *t*-1, you know,	might
124935:33	and. and, then, uh, maybe we'll talk again.	maybe
124987:21	i guess the seville, probably or.	probably
125098:23	we've driven them for about probably twenty years.	probably
125225:49	if we're going *-1 to have national health insurance, which *t*-2 seems likely, it's necessarily going *-3 to involve more taxes.	likely
125270:47	i think 0 japan, i think 0 japan is probably about equal to ours	probably
125325:29	but i, i certainly, certainly have the feeling 0 i've been given *-1 topics different from the ones that i mentioned *t*-2 before.	certainly
125325:37	but i, i certainly, certainly have the feeling 0 i've been given *-1 topics different from the ones that i mentioned *t*-2 before.	certainly
125395:35	so, um, that's something that i'm probably going *-1 to be looking at *t*-2 maybe in the future.	probably
125395:60	so, um, that's something that i'm probably going *-1 to be looking at *t*-2 maybe in the future.	maybe
125479:22	and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day,	maybe
125485:16	you would want, maybe, your child to have their own sheets all the time, and not have another child use that bed you know.	maybe
125510:42	but, um, i figure, you know, 0 i'd probably start *-2 asking around at church because i know 0 they have a limit as to how old they can be *t*-1 before they, you know, before you can bring them in.	probably
125586:10	but then maybe he'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run.	maybe
125669:17	uh, more than likely, it's going *-1 to be a chrysler.	likely
125969:46	when *-2 teeing off *t*-1 i-, i'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground	probably
125991:56	well, it, it, it usually takes me about probably two, two or three *-1 to get it there	probably
125994:15	uh, uh, maybe one or two putts.	maybe
126023:15	your shitty golf is probably the best golf 0 i've ever seen *t*-1.	probably
126092:36	and, uh, especially with, with possibly children around.	possibly
126274:18	i think 0 it might be good for them.	might
126278:27	but as a mother of two daughters i might be afraid of where they were sent *-1 *t*-2.	might
126286:35	because if they do good work in america they'll probably be sent *-1 to a ghetto.	probably
126301:15	i think 0 maybe it's, it should stay on a voluntary basis.	maybe
126303:11	it will probably never happen	probably
126312:26	well it, it probably won't *?*.	probably
126330:8	it might be a real eye opener, you know.	might
126342:8	i probably lived in one of those when i was a little girl *t*-1.	probably
126377:59	i'm just sitting at home and, and, uh, doing laundry today and certainly not up,	certainly
126413:8	patty might *?*.	might
126477:26	i don't know if they could possibly teach a machine *-1 to recognize all the different accents.	possibly
126538:8	she might *?*.	might
126630:19	we've seen that movie probably six times in the last six months.	probably
126822:9	but, probably once a month or so, there was some reason that i would have *-1 to put on a suit *t*-2. for a customer presentation or something.	probably
127030:18	uh, so there were probably really fight *-1 to keep it in if they could *?*.	probably
127104:20	i think 0 maybe they, uh, maybe they contributed to it.	maybe
127104:36	i think 0 maybe they, uh, maybe they contributed to it.	maybe
127166:45	but she's, uh, n-, you know, probably more popular *ich*-1 out of the state than she is *?* here, although she did manage *-2 to win.	probably
127527:31	so that's why i thought 0 i might be interested in it *t*-1,	might
127543:36	since i've been getting the journal, like maybe, maybe i'll read two, maybe three,	maybe
127543:44	since i've been getting the journal, like maybe, maybe i'll read two, maybe three,	maybe
127543:64	since i've been getting the journal, like maybe, maybe i'll read two, maybe three,	maybe
127657:47	if i'm home on mondays, then i, i definitely watch her.	definitely
127668:16	well, he's probably playing himself.	probably
127723:14	well, maybe, maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime.	maybe
127723:22	well, maybe, maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime.	maybe
127833:24	gosh, you never will, *?* probably.	probably
128005:43	and that takes about, really about, maybe about thirteen minutes, uh in the morning.	maybe
128069:82	and during the summer, i'll do, you know, at least seventy-five miles a week and when i really was doing it *t*-1 maybe a hundred and fifty,	maybe
128365:60	if, if they chose a college in a different part of the country that maybe the, they were unused to their, that, the way 0 *t*-1 they run things *t*-2,	maybe
128373:41	i'm thinking what, what problems my children might have *t*-1 in that, uh,	might
128388:41	if they're used to the northern weather then the southern weather they might kind of feel like they need *-1 to go out and play all the time, not be in *-2 studying. if you're in florida or california.	might
128413:10	and also maybe then the parents could pay a third	maybe
128414:10	and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is *t*-1.	maybe
128424:33	i mean, we still have, definitely can put away the money for college now.	definitely
128430:13	my son is certainly not persuaded *-1 of that.	certainly
128528:50	uh, except that the rumor is, is that they still might *?*,	might
128682:16	uh, it's definitely a lot better. a lot more realistic really.	definitely
128792:11	durham has probably got the worst.	probably
128854:45	i, i'm, i'm probably the, one of the youngest people that *t*-1 live over here.	probably
128884:69	one, one thing that *t*-2 effects us is 0 we have apartments that *t*-1 are probably about a half mile away	probably
129051:46	it's got *-1 to be like, it's probably fifty, fifty-five, maybe.	probably
129051:58	it's got *-1 to be like, it's probably fifty, fifty-five, maybe.	maybe
129183:8	you might know her.	might
129186:42	i think 0 she graduated around then, too, though, eighty-seven probably,	probably
129241:11	they are probably still in deliberations on it.	probably
129518:32	steamed she-, uh, shellfish with maybe herbs.	maybe
129591:12	so, we might have some cocktails *ich*-1 ahead of time and maybe some, uh, some dip, uh, some cheese.	might
129591:39	so, we might have some cocktails *ich*-1 ahead of time and maybe some, uh, some dip, uh, some cheese.	maybe
129612:68	but that's, i guess 0 when you talk about dinner party *t*-2, that's probably not, uh, that's more for like when friends come over *t*-1.	probably
129670:56	um, and he's not interested in *-1 letting his twenty-one year old daughter experiment with it probably.	probably
129875:27	but i think 0 the city one could possibly look into that or something.	possibly
130177:23	i, i certainly wouldn't want *-1 to be the executioner,	certainly
130201:17	so, i'll more likely get a car for economic reasons.	likely
130208:7	so probably a economic size car or, uh,	probably
130384:36	but if i were *-1 to get a sports car, maybe white or red.	maybe
130480:33	it's, it will be probably the most exciting place 0 i'll ever get *-1 to go *t*-2.	probably
130586:10	so that might be fun.	might
130714:8	you probably get charged *-1 like a nickel or something like that.	probably
130764:15	well, shoot, maybe what we ought *-1 to do *t*-2 is *-1 start *-3 sending unsmashed, uh, pepsi cans and whatever up there.	maybe
130789:74	but if it's going *-1 to cost you *-2 to take care of the environment, they're not quite as, uh likely *-3 to do it as if, uh, if you get something back for it. you know.	likely
130791:6	as likely * to do it.	likely
130809:36	if it costs them something, then they're not as likely *-1 to use it.	likely
130890:8	you probably have enjoyed *-1 getting away from the snow.	probably
130925:23	i, i probably do know,	probably
130948:59	so, uh my particular area, the homes run anywhere from about sixty-five, eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million.	probably
130974:47	i mean, we've got houses two streets away that *t*-1 are probably around seventy, eighty thousand	probably
131049:13	and this was definitely not a fix up special,	definitely
131087:13	and that's probably going *-1 to increase. you know.	probably
131122:8	it definitely has changed.	definitely
131192:21	i think that we're probably going *-1 to see a lot more companies, uh, run * by females.	probably
131208:7	and probably, uh, we'll see more females in political roles.	probably
131220:42	and, uh, so i think 0 we're probably going *-1 to see more of that in the future.	probably
131225:21	i think 0 that's probably good.	probably
131230:14	and, uh, maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners	maybe
131271:13	and they're probably,	probably
131303:17	and some ways, it might be kind of scary.	might
131529:13	well, i certainly hope so.	certainly
131749:8	i probably need *-1 to take some, some more lessons, uh, more current and, uh, and practice more often.	probably
131755:21	i think 0 i'm probably the same way.	probably
131982:4	definitely.	definitely
132138:22	that wasn't alive for but maybe two years.	maybe
132170:13	and there's probably some truth to that.	probably
132425:103	but, you know by the time 0 i get over the gym and, and go for my class and shower and get back to work *t*-1, it is probably two hours or more	probably
132511:33	and it's, it's probably about a hundred and fifty dollars a year. which *t*-1 is bad.	probably
132533:24	but he decided that, uh, maybe, uh, you know,	maybe
132543:16	well, that's probably the next year's agenda.	probably
132554:53	and i, i, i think 0 that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now.	probably
132575:60	and where people that make, you know, two hundred, three hundred thousand dollars a year *t*-3, certainly a portion of that, they aren't going *-4 to be paying taxes on *t*-5, you know.	certainly
132608:17	you, maybe you buy that, you know,	maybe
132629:70	one of the best things 0 i heard *t*-1 on taxes * to stimulate the economy, someone, brilliant deductor, probably lloyd bentsen, said that all, you know, if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be, you know, spending more money *-2 using their credit cards.	probably
132629:145	one of the best things 0 i heard *t*-1 on taxes * to stimulate the economy, someone, brilliant deductor, probably lloyd bentsen, said that all, you know, if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be, you know, spending more money *-2 using their credit cards.	probably
132637:137	but if you look on all interest things, not just credit cards, but on your cars and, you know, a-, any kind of interest that you're paying *t*-1, from a personal point of view, that might make certain sense in * stimulating consumer purchasers.	might
132709:8	you probably,	probably
132737:15	this wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds	probably
132887:30	or would i, would i probably actually buy *?*.	probably
132912:10	but i maybe would buy a b m w. uh, or, or even a volvo.	maybe
133020:13	i would probably, if i were *-1 to buy a car mys-, you know, with the constraints of real money i probably would, would go with something like, you know, like a honda accord.	probably
133020:88	i would probably, if i were *-1 to buy a car mys-, you know, with the constraints of real money i probably would, would go with something like, you know, like a honda accord.	probably
133106:13	um, i probably wouldn't *?*, just because i already have one	probably
133231:11	it's probably, um,	probably
133233:5	maybe a little smaller.	maybe
133244:15	i thought 0 maybe it was you.	maybe
133248:8	i certainly have some ideas since i'm studying it now in college.	certainly
133283:11	something is definitely wrong.	definitely
133294:20	so, um, that's definitely a problem.	definitely
133340:34	and, uh, you know, where our kids might be in a great school *t*-1, we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who *t*-2 are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read, you know.	might
133375:10	so i probably can't *?*.	probably
133419:21	i think 0 it'll probably be as difficult.	probably
133422:21	um, well, i'm certainly in favor of aids research,	certainly
133423:17	and i think 0 probably the government could spend a bit more money *ich*-1 on it than it does.	probably
133478:135	i don't, i think 0 it *exp*-1's very strange that the media hasn't, um, questioned him more strongly to, about gay sex or intravenous drugs or anything like that, as they probably would *?* for a lot of other people.	probably
133482:66	um, well, not, not really, though i mean, i think 0 he's probably doing the right thing for a man in his position,	probably
133512:22	i guess 0 you might, might not *?*.	might
133512:30	i guess 0 you might, might not *?*.	might
133558:67	um, short term, i don't think 0 anything's going *-1 to be done *-2 about it or probably should be done *-1 about it.	probably
133581:277	um, i'm not really, uh, sure that i even understand why the administration is proposing, for instance, tax reductions *t*-1, because it seems to me that if, if, if they're talking about * reducing, uh, the tax that *t*-4 needs *-2 to be paid *-5, or the tax that *t*-3's currently being paid *-6, then that can't, it seems to me 0 it can't possibly, you know, help with the, the deficit picture.	possibly
133607:11	it's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is *t*-1.	probably
133651:64	i think that, i think that, that i agree with you certainly in the second situation,	certainly
133702:30	once you get it done, then you probably won't have that problem again.	probably
133769:28	well, um, well probably the last thing 0 i did *t*-1 was, uh, * paint and wallpaper kids room	probably
133784:17	and i wonder if maybe i should have used a gloss.	maybe
133794:17	but i think 0 maybe, uh,	maybe
134199:10	well, certainly some of the top end ones.	certainly
134230:33	up, up there, maybe, maybe you guys don't have as, uh, big a problem with air pollution as many, do you?	maybe
134230:41	up, up there, maybe, maybe you guys don't have as, uh, big a problem with air pollution as many, do you?	maybe
134283:5	probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have *-1 to po-, post warnings *ich*-2 now, you know, as far as health concerns.	probably
134311:15	and all wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of, uh, bike trails for recreational use of any of the states.	probably
134334:5	maybe to you and i who *t*-1 have grown up in some in, uh, uh, some more beautiful parts of the country, uh, i think that, that, uh, we become a little more aware *ich*-2, uh, rather quickly of, of what *t*-3's happening with air pollution and how, uh, how horrible it really is *t*-4.	maybe
134392:89	but, i, um, tend to all the, planting the annuals and, and the spraying and, um, *-1 taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in, you know, throughout that season, and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and, um, any kind of decorating for the holidays, you know,	maybe
134392:130	but, i, um, tend to all the, planting the annuals and, and the spraying and, um, *-1 taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in, you know, throughout that season, and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and, um, any kind of decorating for the holidays, you know,	maybe
134484:5	maybe one of these days i'll have *-1 to get out there and mow,	maybe
134632:11	it's definitely new frontier stuff.	definitely
134751:56	it's, it's, it's something *ich*-1 definitely that, uh, you know,	definitely
134782:14	it's still probably going,	probably
134786:43	but the economy the way 0 it is *t*-1 all over, they probably cut back on on that, because it's not,	probably
134868:101	and, uh, right now we're in a, uh, i guess 0 it's *rnr*-2 either a zero lot line or a garden home. which you might call it *t*-1.	might
135182:26	well, i'm sure 0 you probably are *?*.	probably
135258:17	well, they're probably easier than * keeping dogs, though, aren't they *?*.	probably
135267:10	and you probably have *-1 to clean out the tank too.	probably
135298:50	and so you'd have *-1 to start all over *-2 to build that up probably.	probably
135368:16	well, they're probably hardy, harder 0 * to take care of *t*-1	probably
135465:13	we might, right. we might decide what *t*-1's proper and what *t*-2 isn't *?*,	might
135465:29	we might, right. we might decide what *t*-1's proper and what *t*-2 isn't *?*,	might
135672:8	i probably have missed the last few since i've been back in school.	probably
135716:16	so she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers,	possibly
135754:7	and maybe that turns people off,	maybe
135823:40	so you, you, you probably go everywhere and have all sorts of weather.	probably
136170:10	and i maybe watched it for a week	maybe
136286:27	it snowed a little bit, um, probably about four days ago	probably
136382:35	um, i've, i've probably talked maybe to five people.	probably
136382:41	um, i've, i've probably talked maybe to five people.	maybe
136422:28	we've been getting quite a bit, maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around san antonio,	maybe
136432:14	but you're probably, what, about halfway across the state from san antonio, though, aren't you *?*?	probably
136603:50	well, the previous owner had a major problem with it, because, uh, oh probably a variety of things.	probably
136633:11	they're probably at an age where they don't want *-1 to spend any time with their parents *t*-2.	probably
136676:19	so i really do spend probably more time *ich*-1 with him than, than most, you know.	probably
136911:33	um, the furthest 0 i drove *t*-1 was probably texas,	probably
137037:18	well, and you can probably,	probably
137039:13	so you have probably a lot of green, and lot of real pretty things.	probably
137129:5	maybe those type of products sh-, should be for older kids.	maybe
137139:7	but maybe they are *?*.	maybe
137291:32	and you're trying *-1 to think oh, maybe i'll need this.	maybe
137305:8	you probably got your worth out of it anyway.	probably
137317:13	well, you probably are real careful of the brands 0 you buy *t*-1	probably
137318:47	and the, when you do buy things *t*-1, you probably watch what kind of, type of mumblex.	probably
137436:54	but that's my first trip back in, oh, goodness, um, um, thirty years maybe.	maybe
137540:10	uh, probably the, the last one that i went to california *t*-1	probably
137655:18	uh, football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world.	probably
137844:22	or somebody that *t*-1's maybe got a cadillac or lincoln and lexus dealership, uh	maybe
137906:36	this is a, uh, uh, probably suspension tied * into the brakes.	probably
137925:13	mississippi probably doesn't, mississippi probably doesn't have *-1 to worry too much.	probably
137925:29	mississippi probably doesn't, mississippi probably doesn't have *-1 to worry too much.	probably
137946:24	and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter 0 they'd seen *t*-1 in twenty years,	probably
138039:15	the lincoln ride is certainly good, too,	certainly
138062:111	but, uh, i think 0 they're, big city public schools by definition are having a, a tough time right now just from, uh, probably from budget cuts and, and everything else going on.	probably
138093:13	so it's maybe a hundred per grade.	maybe
138205:15	so life is not maybe as simple as it was *?* at one time,	maybe
138249:17	so i think that maybe that's effected it to some degree.	maybe
138254:18	i think 0 that probably does have, have something 0 *t*-1 to do with it,	probably
138393:31	whereas if you're ripping wood, you're probably better off with a, a table saw.	probably
138503:13	so that was probably my own fault that she didn't,	probably
138551:7	and maybe that was,	maybe
138640:47	but, i think 0 for * taking kids to a, probably people that *t*-1 take them to, uh, preschools and day-cares full time, oh, they would, i don't know, probably just feel a different,	probably
138640:125	but, i think 0 for * taking kids to a, probably people that *t*-1 take them to, uh, preschools and day-cares full time, oh, they would, i don't know, probably just feel a different,	probably
138681:91	i think 0 it's a trend that *t*-3's, that *t*-4's, that *t*-1's, uh, probably may go nationwide eventually because i think 0 national health is something that we all need *t*-2.	probably
138774:87	and i feel very strongly about, uh, children, and, uh, developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year. where we certainly proved that we're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who *t*-1 need it most *t*-2.	certainly
139054:37	and other than that, you know, it would be maybe october and then in the spring	maybe
139140:44	but, uh, it's, uh, it's definitely different.	definitely
139243:85	you don't think about that as a career, a normal career, uh, when you're thinking of things that people might be doing *t*-1 *t*-2.	might
139292:8	you probably do a lot of that with scout scouting.	probably
139438:14	i was just probably three or four years,	probably
139633:99	now i've done it with, where you put, you cook the ri-, well, i guess 0 you probably could do it same way, but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup, and put a little bit of white wine in it *t*-1.	probably
139732:7	or maybe it's only half hour.	maybe
139962:27	um, you know, uh, maybe three hundred, four hundred feet elevation, uh, type variations from the valleys up to the hills, the hilltops.	maybe
140057:7	and probably a good, uh, student teacher ratio and things.	probably
140073:31	uh, well, um, first off we'd probably wind up with a, a cat or maybe a puppy.	probably
140073:66	uh, well, um, first off we'd probably wind up with a, a cat or maybe a puppy.	maybe
140186:60	one year down in florida on a vacation, for father's day, my kids, years ago, maybe, uh, ten years ago, go, bought me a skunk from a exotic pet shop.	maybe
140458:8	it certainly is frightening.	certainly
140494:10	so i certainly hope 0 you have a nice new year.	certainly
140638:30	it's, it's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood,	certainly
140652:100	it, it, it, it does, it, it seems about, oh, probably average.	probably
140705:11	it's definitely not one of the, the smaller ones,	definitely
140884:30	have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside *t*-1?	maybe
140959:15	you know, maybe you nee-, you can get it signed *-1 up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes.	maybe
141103:68	and, uh, my husband and i will go out to dinner and come home and, um, probably not too late.	probably
141183:24	i think 0 in plano and maybe this area in texas, there's a lot of community activities that parents could join in *t*-1 with their kids.	maybe
141245:143	i, i personally feel that it *exp*-1 is extremely important * to be with your own child, um, for the, at least for the first two years of their lives. i mean, if you, can possibly swing it	possibly
141341:43	and so we have *-1 to plan anywhere from six, well really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone, can uh, start their, uh, vacation time.	probably
141419:10	well, maybe this year you can find a more central location.	maybe
141454:30	well, uh, uh, i guess 0 probably the last one 0 i went to *t*-1 i met so many people that i had not seen *t*-2 in probably ten, over ten years.	probably
141454:95	well, uh, uh, i guess 0 probably the last one 0 i went to *t*-1 i met so many people that i had not seen *t*-2 in probably ten, over ten years.	probably
141481:27	well, i think 0 that is probably why our is probably so interesting *t*-1 is cause we don't have them that often	probably
141481:41	well, i think 0 that is probably why our is probably so interesting *t*-1 is cause we don't have them that often	probably
141541:17	maybe, maybe you will get lucky and get a girl this time.	maybe
141583:7	but maybe that riding place that *t*-2 is north of town that she goes to *t*-1.	maybe
141633:11	well you probably know a peace group that, uh, that they are advanced type. that they are special, well, uh, classes for peace classes.	probably
141946:8	we certainly get enough coverage.	certainly
142100:18	i think 0 that might be true.	might
142175:17	but my golf clubs will probably rust before i get *-1 to use them again	probably
142177:13	and it is probably going *-1 to be six to eight years before they go to college.	probably
142188:16	well, they would probably never make it then	probably
142252:17	i put mine in probably in november.	probably
142279:19	but they make it through probably winter and spring.	probably
142413:23	like i said, we are probably as far as you can get from the seven eleven and still be in texas.	probably
142628:69	i think 0 i am going *-1 to put something like a brown on it, on the outside. and maybe, a little deeper brown *ich*-2 in the entry way or something so it will stand out a little.	maybe
142673:65	but and the only thing 0 i would consider * doing, a professional, maybe doing that,	maybe
142735:34	oh, i think 0 that is what we might have *-1 to do *t*-2 with this chimney,	might
142745:10	shoot, maybe a hundred and fifty.	maybe
142812:23	but i think 0 i will probably just do it, in a roller.	probably
142874:22	they're the ones that probably *t*-1 are paying the highest.	probably
142923:78	as far as the rangers are concerned *-1, i think, i think 0 they need some, definitely need some pitching.	definitely
142972:10	but howse might be a different, uh, situation,	might
142973:23	and i think 0 you're probably right, that they, that they need some, you know, some changes in, uh, pitching coach, maybe	probably
142973:108	and i think 0 you're probably right, that they, that they need some, you know, some changes in, uh, pitching coach, maybe	maybe
143026:32	but, um, i guess 0 my favorite is probably switzerland and ireland.	probably
143233:30	main-, mainly probably because you want *-1 to see everything.	probably
143402:11	i'm probably older than you,	probably
143408:41	so i can board up their rooms, and look forward to retirement maybe.	maybe
143415:45	so, we're looking forward to *-1 retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to florida or somewhere. closer, closer to our families.	maybe
143456:23	you need very minimum four and probably five.	probably
143505:63	lot of people will buy, in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or the, or do something.	maybe
143535:138	there's, uh, * seems like there's more constraints more things that she thinks about *t*-1. you know, openness, uh, the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that i would probably gloss over *t*-2 and, maybe even ignore *t*-2, you know.	probably
143535:156	there's, uh, * seems like there's more constraints more things that she thinks about *t*-1. you know, openness, uh, the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that i would probably gloss over *t*-2 and, maybe even ignore *t*-2, you know.	maybe
143540:10	why, certainly.	certainly
143698:20	well, well, uh, maybe it was the area 0 i was in *t*-1,	maybe
143737:26	i, i could probably pay them off any month if i wanted *-1 to *?*.	probably
143883:30	but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back.	probably
143920:39	i just figure 0 with the visa and american express, i probably have an,	probably
143937:8	i probably wouldn't be able *-1 to use them.	probably
143946:21	and i do use dillard's probably as, more than any of the other department stores.	probably
143984:47	well, as far as i'm concerned and it's probably apt that your call's at this time because we just got through *-2 watching, uh, reasonable doubts. which *t*-1 had a, you know, capital case in it.	probably
144309:18	i was thinking 0 maybe david robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing.	maybe
144315:42	i mean, of course, * drafting a franchise like him certainly,	certainly
144352:91	and i think i think 0 jordan and the, and the bulls have *-1 to be, uh, considered *-2 the likely favorites.	likely
144406:71	i think 0 they're doing the, is as much research as they can possibly do *?*, you know.	possibly
144417:11	i'm definitely not aware of how much.	definitely
144440:99	uh, if, if we were talking about the money, uh, i'd just have *-1 to say 0 what they're spending *t*-2 is probably enough, simply because i don't know that much about it. you know.	probably
144483:11	it's definitely not *?*.	definitely
144525:27	and, uh, i mean, it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry.	certainly
144597:33	i mean, i, i definitely think that it's the drug problem that *t*-1 needs *-2 to be addressed *-3,	definitely
144675:10	but it probably takes a lot.	probably
144932:8	you probably, uh, more up on this subject than i am *?*,	probably
145018:17	so, they certainly, uh, they certainly deserve it all the way.	certainly
145018:33	so, they certainly, uh, they certainly deserve it all the way.	certainly
145063:18	you know, she certainly did her part in * help *-1 getting me establishing in my business	certainly
145165:10	uh, probably. uh,	probably
145166:99	actually spring semester a year from now he's going *-1 to have *-2 to be in child care f-, uh, five days a week more than likely. uh, depending on how my class schedule runs *t*-3	likely
145220:18	they've been here probably thirty, forty years.	probably
145462:44	but i can, i can under-, certainly understand where,	certainly
145469:19	the thing that *t*-1 probably helps me most *-2 doing that is really, you know, uh, not so much discipline,	probably
145569:8	i might,	might
145579:13	um, i might try that because i, i have one card that i've had *t*-1 for about, uh, i don't know, nine or ten years.	might
145751:54	i'm, i'm quite a bit, i'm probably a lot older than you are *?*.	probably
145754:10	well, maybe, uh, they just moved away and then sort of lost contact.	maybe
145903:45	and the way 0 medical expenses are *t*-4 i think 0 that's probably one of the biggest benefits * to ha-, 0 you need *-2 to have *t*-3.	probably
145993:8	plus probably an additional six months through the, the worker's stuff that they have *t*-1 at, at, uh, through the company	probably
146239:24	i think 0 gluing alone, certainly if you wash it any amount of time, it tends *-1 to kind of come loose at the edges.	certainly
146432:14	i like colombo probably the best of any of those mystery things.	probably
146512:8	we might as well *?*.	might
146643:13	well, i definitely think that we need *-1 to start *-2 recycling.	definitely
146936:12	it *exp*-1 might kill you * to go up and, walk up to the door	might
146997:16	of course, you probably wear coats a lot.	probably
147023:27	we have a few days 0 you might wear a coat, winter coat, *t*-1 you know,	might
147116:24	i think 0 the automobile *ich*-2 definitely is an area and any, any industry that *t*-1 burns, you know,	definitely
147159:33	i think 0 something *ich*-2 too that you probably see *t*-3 in older states, all we, we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces *t*-1.	probably
147385:13	what she probably would do *t*-1 is * disburse the money to me	probably
147728:23	uh, i think 0 it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody *t*-1.	probably
147728:31	uh, i think 0 it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody *t*-1.	likely
147733:33	but, uh, other than that i think 0 maybe it just depends on how you define honesty *t*-1.	maybe
147755:31	and personally i feel 0 it's probably, there's probably some of each.	probably
147755:45	and personally i feel 0 it's probably, there's probably some of each.	probably
147759:17	but i think 0 maybe a lot of them, um,	maybe
147772:19	the president of general motors probably has the same,	probably
147911:47	well, i have *-1 to say 0 my favorite type of music would probably be, uh, classical music.	probably
147968:30	so, i'd say, 0 vivaldi is probably my favorite, uh, composer.	probably
147974:23	uh, he's, uh, definitely one of the, one of the top of that era.	definitely
148143:6	more likely *-1 to see those at a ski show or something,	likely
148353:97	i, uh, i don't think 0 i've ever met a type of music 0 i don't like *t*-1 except for, uh, maybe, you know, heavy metal and that.	maybe
148387:57	but i, i like *-1 to listen to, uh, what you might call *t*-2 pop, easy listening country western, jazz uh, classical, um,	might
148424:8	you might try that.	might
148428:22	most, most likely i would be listen to, uh, jazz or classical music.	likely
148712:37	oh, well that's that'ud probably give you a smoother finish, wouldn't it *?*?	probably
148843:11	you're probably a veteran at this.	probably
149042:11	i'm probably eventually going *-1 to get a three eighty-six.	probably
149219:15	i think 0 probably when i get system seven *t*-1 i may have *-2 to do that and, and get another, possibly another hard disk.	probably
149219:91	i think 0 probably when i get system seven *t*-1 i may have *-2 to do that and, and get another, possibly another hard disk.	possibly
149402:10	oh, definitely.	definitely
149480:18	um, he's probably, oh, a good two years old, big, old, fat and sassy tabby.	probably
149665:45	it's on, i think 0 *t*-1, two or three nights for maybe an hour or two	maybe
149771:79	especially the democratic candidates don't seem *-1 to be coming up with much that *t*-2 really sparks my interest as far as yeah, maybe that could do something 0 *t*-3 to affect our budget at this point.	maybe
149982:8	and probably, um, they need *-1 to try *-2 to increase community involvement, that sort of thing, i think 0 *t*-3 mumblex.	probably
149984:8	i probably agree with that.	probably
149998:11	that's probably true.	probably
150002:43	i'd say 0 it's, it's probably in the top, top ten in terms of crime.	probably
150109:7	so maybe that counts.	maybe
150153:15	well, you're probably luckier than.	probably
150236:29	i didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than,	probably
150517:76	i would think that that type of employment, you're, you're, one day you might be really tuned in and the next day, oh, a little luke warm or something	might
150551:11	those are probably the two main things 0 i like *-1 to do *t*-2.	probably
150560:93	um, in, in, in the winter, you, typically it's, it's probably too cold * to go out and do things like tennis.	probably
150680:35	i, i think 0 my ankles probably are my main weak point.	probably
150806:33	and so um, i get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then, um, * talking with people and just hearing what *t*-1's going on. mumblex.	probably
150857:108	you, you just can't get a full picture of, you know their message unless you have time 0 * to sit down and r-, and probably read something on it *t*-1.	probably
150925:79	if they reported every, if they reported every violent crime in atlanta it would take, it would probably take the whole news hour.	probably
150984:15	i guess 0 maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who *t*-1 is very unreasonable in some way, that, uh, you, uh, would have a problem, uh, you know, that you wouldn't convict someone who *t*-2 maybe should be convicted *-4.	maybe
150984:155	i guess 0 maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who *t*-1 is very unreasonable in some way, that, uh, you, uh, would have a problem, uh, you know, that you wouldn't convict someone who *t*-2 maybe should be convicted *-4.	maybe
151065:91	uh, one, one thing that i, i think 0 *t*-1 is, um, you know, maybe is a problem is, uh, i, i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now,	maybe
151066:17	but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well.	maybe
151107:82	the one thing 0 i sometimes wonder about *t*-1, um, in civil cases is, uh, whether, especially sort of in, uh, maybe like pro-, product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, um, sort of a very technical decision 0 *t*-2 to be made *-3 sometimes *t*-4	maybe
151208:106	and then, it was always exciting when we got called *-1 *-4 to, to, to go *t*-2, because then we thought 0 we might be able *-3 to do something else besides, uh, * just sit in the jury room.	might
151247:14	because you'd probably be, uh, too puritanical	probably
151251:11	that was probably it,	probably
151255:19	although in my case i might have been more, uh, sympathetic with the person who *t*-1 got caught *-2,	might
151468:18	all right, it's probably the same thing.	probably
151758:23	it's about two hundred people, maybe.	maybe
151763:22	um, the, probably the biggest challenge was * getting a place where everyone, you know, could eat comfortably and, and everything *t*-1, uh.	probably
151767:15	i guess 0 probably the most helpful thing was that, um, for the rent, we rented like a, a rescue squad building or something like that.	probably
151815:11	she looks probably like she's in her early sixties	probably
151916:8	i might as well *?*.	might
152278:47	uh, so the, uh, the benefits, uh, probably the main thing 0 i like *t*-1 about the benefits is the, uh, the, uh, very generous vacation time and sick time.	probably
152298:8	you maybe get two or three a year.	maybe
152354:23	i think 0 health care is probably the, the most pressing uh, the pressing one,	probably
152472:23	and i suppose 0 that's maybe a disadvantage of * being in a larger institution, perhaps somewhat even with the business, uh.	maybe
152498:57	uh, so i, i think 0 there it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in, uh, institutions are slower * to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses, we need *-1 to cut back, that's what we do *t*-2.	probably
152558:12	that's maybe the majority of the importance, i guess 0 *t*-1.	maybe
152575:15	i think 0 probably in a small,	probably
152578:8	you probably have a better team, uh, cooperation, or team playing, atmosphere.	probably
152647:11	that's definitely a problem.	definitely
152676:35	i, guess 0 i, i definitely agree with you,	definitely
152919:117	i mean it *exp*-3 doesn't seem right that somebody that *t*-1 makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that *t*-2 makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes.	might
153037:35	i think, you know 0 the probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers	probably
153060:24	also i have found that newspapers probably aren't as bad as television mumblex.	probably
153425:16	i'd probably, i'd probably say about a five.	probably
153425:30	i'd probably, i'd probably say about a five.	probably
153427:22	that's where i would probably be *t*-1.	probably
153454:197	uh, you know, i mean, the problem though, you know, they, if the, since the united states had this, you know, pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that i think, you know, 0 if you were introduced, you know, any controls, it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already.	probably
153480:36	if i get one, i think 0 i will probably, you know, get something.	probably
153481:8	i probably wouldn't get a hand gun.	probably
153482:11	i would probably get like a shotgun.	probably
153500:11	they are probably going *-1 to miss the person	probably
153596:24	that's, uh, sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what i have *t*-1.	probably
153661:18	i just have a maybe a targeted amount that i will save for *t*-1.	maybe
153663:5	probably within a year i would like *-1 to buy a new car.	probably
153672:16	uh, cars are definitely something that you have *-1 to figure *t*-2 into your budget. not only for * buying them, but for * keeping them on the road too.	definitely
153714:42	but if you are rolling it over every three years, it *exp*-1 might be advantageous * to do that.	might
153787:24	* coming from texas you're probably,	probably
153790:16	but gun control is probably frowned on *-2 quite a bit down there i would think 0 *t*-1.	probably
153957:49	i guess, i guess 0 some forms of guns should probably be controlled *-1	probably
153984:18	you know, you might do the same thing.	might
154198:8	you probably,	probably
154199:36	if you just watched it during the gulf war, that probably wouldn't wouldn't tell you much.	probably
154291:28	we found that, uh, it's definitely helped, uh, * get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses.	definitely
154500:51	so you have never heard of like the christian music that i listen to *t*-1 probably.	probably
154905:17	i only do it probably two or three times a week.	probably
154931:10	or they might play tennis	might
155020:13	well, it might not *?*.	might
155106:10	well, maybe it isn't in utah.	maybe
155220:46	but, uh, we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people *t*-1.	might
155221:8	we certainly have a fair number of people that *t*-1 are on welfa-, welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing.	certainly
155300:24	* find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way 0 we will be able *-1 to, uh, do it *t*-2.	probably
155358:13	uh, * probably need *-2 to try *-1 to get back on the topic	probably
155760:8	oh definitely it's,	definitely
155897:36	like they send me to conferences for instance, but probably not as much as i'd like *?*	probably
155907:19	you have what you might call *t*-1 knowledge power	might
155997:7	but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in *-2 trying *-1 to catch up.	maybe
156005:12	uh, but maybe * standardizing on, on a, a four year term for congress senate and the, the presidency and then, uh, staggering them so that you don't,	maybe
156042:20	you know, it might only be two hour drive from here,	might
156118:31	but i've always considered automobiles to be, probably the, the prime contributor.	probably
156120:23	but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that.	probably
156122:22	oh, d-, definitely.	definitely
156169:48	i think 0 that's a, that's a contributor definitely.	definitely
156250:11	denver's definitely	definitely
156270:40	i mean, it, it definitely it's not at a level comparable to los angeles or denver	definitely
156300:16	well, i would probably be a junkie or s-, watch c n n a lot,	probably
156350:88	but, uh, and when you read a lot of this stuff *t*-1, the, the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so,	definitely
156393:34	uh, i guess 0 a year ago you're probably watching c n n a lot,	probably
156698:11	that's probably true * considering,	probably
156720:8	quicker maybe,	maybe
156726:97	if, if the person who *t*-1's going *-2 to commit the crime knew that they were going *-3 to be punished *-4 severely, possibly capital punishment,	possibly
156756:16	um, that's probably true,	probably
156812:16	well, that's probably true.	probably
156841:5	certainly capital punishment isn't going *-1 to solve a lot of problems	certainly
156864:49	uh, premeditated murder. crimes of that nature, i think 0 *t*-1 should definitely,	definitely
156891:34	i think 0 we need, we definitely need more of it, definitely.	definitely
156891:55	i think 0 we need, we definitely need more of it, definitely.	definitely
156922:66	i mean, still, you know, since it's dormant for such a long time, there's still probably a lot of people, you know, before the tests ever really came out who *t*-1 are, who *t*-2 are draining a lot of money right now. you know,	probably
157007:11	i would probably agree with that.	probably
157057:27	uh, and, you know, it certainly doesn't seem *-1 to be a deterrent. uh, for one thing because it's used *-4 so infrequently and for another thing because i honestly don't think 0 the people that *t*-2 are committing the c-, crimes that *t*-3 would be eligible, you know, really care.	certainly
157088:89	but, but the other side to that is, 0 if you put him in prison for life, there's a chance that he might do things in prison, or, you know, and somehow redeem himself.	might
157098:96	there are cases where, you know, twenty, thirty years after the fact of * getting evidence, especially as new technology *ich*-2 comes along that *t*-1 might prove their innocence, then, oops, i'm sorry *t*-3,	might
157136:63	w-, w-, we're going *-1 to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something.	probably
157161:63	you know, a, a, a sixty-two year old guy is less likely * to be put *-1 on death row from what i've seen *t*-2.	likely
157168:65	, i mean, obviously, if someone of mine who *t*-1 has close died, i'd probably feel differently,	probably
157320:140	uh, i think 0 i'd like *-1 to get, uh, b m w or if i go the german route, which i'm kind of leaning towards *t*-2 right now, but, uh, or maybe a, hon-, i mean, a, a acura legend.	maybe
157328:25	a lexus, uh, s c three hundred maybe. something on that order.	maybe
157443:58	uh, i think, well, 0 something on the order of a three series, it's probably different.	probably
157571:10	but you probably pay more *ich*-1 percentage wise in other taxes.	probably
157857:30	i'll, i'll probably have about, two, two and a half years left *.	probably
157977:21	i wonder if i could possibly take it on call waiting.	possibly
158276:47	like * say 0 some young kids or something like that that *t*-1 might be inclined more towards a life of crime, had *-2 to sit and watch and, and see a guy burn or, or, you know, something or shot *-3 by a firing squad or something like that.	might
158586:51	i, i, i think 0 that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and p h d's and all that kind of thing and, you know, know all the technical stuff,	probably
158639:8	you probably heard where, you know, where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back *-1 to control yourself *t*-2.	probably
158665:40	i think, i think 0 there's definitely been some changes, um,	definitely
158666:68	and i think you know, 0 the, the, um, end of the soviet union will definitely have its effect on, on the situation.	definitely
158793:98	um, you know, over, over the, uh, over, over what, what *t*-1 probably won't accomplish him, accomplish much for him politically.	probably
159024:12	well maybe, maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that *t*-1's, mumblex come *-3 rolling towards, whatever it's rolling toward *t*-2 *t*-4.	maybe
159024:20	well maybe, maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that *t*-1's, mumblex come *-3 rolling towards, whatever it's rolling toward *t*-2 *t*-4.	maybe
159051:7	or maybe it was on the radi-,	maybe
159123:27	and i think that, um, they might, you know, pay for that. pay for the classes and stuff	might
159139:13	so that will probably help out.	probably
159169:13	but it would definitely be something 0 * to look into *t*-1 once i get my own.	definitely
159266:17	and i think 0 maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous, you know, like millions and millions of dollars.	maybe
159307:15	i think 0 maybe you look at, uh, the age of the person and their station in life and, and, uh, how much longer *ich*-2 they have *t*-1 of work years that they would have *-3 to put up, you know, with, with that *t*-4.	maybe
159308:13	i mean maybe you don't award an eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year old *t*-1.	maybe
159317:34	and that can be part of continuing education *ich*-1, maybe for judges.	maybe
159422:5	maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know 0 *t*-1 is hurting people out there	maybe
159442:25	but i, i certainly wouldn't want *-1 to send my parent unless it was an absolute last re-, resort.	certainly
159657:33	i think 0 i, i might like *-1 dancing to it	might
159840:39	and, and, you know, he's probably about fifty-three years old now,	probably
160007:11	it's probably a long time.	probably
160410:5	probably mumblex at all.	probably
160631:8	they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened	might
160636:24	uh, but most of my news probably comes from newsweek	probably
160645:23	well, actually, it's, probably isn't less broad,	probably
160685:48	i, you know, they, they certainly have a very similar, uh, charter at least in my mind.	certainly
160719:28	uh, it, we might also be helped *-1, though, because it, it *exp*-2 will be easier * to do business over there, too.	might
160722:4	definitely.	definitely
160828:15	which *t*-1 is probably pretty nice,	probably
160911:95	well, i, i mean, i think 0 there's some people, there, y-, certainly are some things where you need infrastructure *t*-1	certainly
161145:16	schnauzers, in particular probably.	probably
161163:40	that's, that's, maybe that's, there's, uh, some credence in that statement.	maybe
161192:8	they might,	might
161312:23	but i think 0 it was probably a, an individual ferret thing, because it was f-, it was a fairly wild ferret.	probably
161409:18	in other words, they probably would not work, may not, en-, may end up *-1 not working at all d-, in the twenties.	probably
162083:104	uh, well, i, i think 0 the people that *t*-2 run, yeah, that *t*-1 run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical, you know.	probably
162249:15	i guess 0 probably the factors 0 we'd use *t*-1 *-2 to compare are a little different because i look for, you know, size and safety, and then mileage.	probably
162320:66	so, i guess 0 you'd have *-1 to say, 0 if i was looking, i would definitely be looking for a foreign car.	definitely
162754:7	so maybe it's the law that *t*-1 wrong in their eyes	maybe
162805:35	and they tend *-1 to view the younger fellows as more likely * to hand down a guilty verdict.	likely
162822:57	but, there, too, there are also cases in which i feel 0 a majority rule might be acceptable *t*-1, particularly, i think in civil cases.	might
162867:10	oh, certainly not,	certainly
162868:4	certainly not.	certainly
162878:8	they probably have a limit now,	probably
162896:8	you might try, uh,	might
162909:10	but it might not *?*.	might
163216:58	well, you know, uh, * talking about the lawyers, you know what *t*-1 might very well do, uh, cause a, uh, a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that, is * to set the fees for cases.	might
163221:124	now, if he comes in and says, you know, i'll repair your, your v c r, or somebody else's v c r, for a hundred dollars, gets in there, maybe it's a blown fuse,	maybe
163225:9	so, maybe if we did that with the lawyers, so that, you know, whether it's a murder case or a, you know, a civil, uh, somebody suing somebody else, you get x dollars for that case	maybe
163353:9	so, maybe that's one thing 0 they can do *t*-1.	maybe
163675:13	well, that might be the difference.	might
163706:10	but there definitely is, is a problem with,	definitely
163746:23	it, it definitely is *?*.	definitely
163818:14	you know, definitely.	definitely
163819:79	uh, so, anything new 0 you like *t*-1 *ich*-3 *ich*-4 coming out now, other than folk music, some 0 i might know of *t*-2.	might
163870:58	late, late sixties, early seventies, they were they were definitely pushing a message.	definitely
163985:10	so you definitely get *-1 to try before you buy.	definitely
163989:11	that's definitely	definitely
164006:11	that's probably not true only for atlanta, but for just about anywhere.	probably
164013:18	what *t*-1's more likely *-2 to occur is, uh, robbery of, uh, you know, * knocking over a, a small store or a car theft, you know, it, things of that nature.	likely
164154:58	but, uh, realistically with, uh, the need * to take the kids to school, * probably have *-1 to have something that, uh, *t*-2 wouldn't wined up *-3 putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat *t*-4.	probably
164161:45	well, i think 0 the next car 0 we get *t*-1 will probably be a,	probably
164169:27	so i think 0 the four door is probably a major requirement	probably
164182:23	and i think 0 that's probably a little over kill for this day and age.	probably
164212:57	and i figure 0 if it's so bad that i need a four wheel drive, i probably ought *-1 to be home anyway.	probably
164255:132	so, i know 0 if we were, if we had kids still at home, we're in our fifties now, but, if we had kids still at home, we'd certainly have *-1 to seriously consider a van just for their functional value.	certainly
164273:58	uh, again, like you, if conditions are, are that bad, i probably don't want *-1 to be driving anyway.	probably
164282:15	oh, boy, probably, uh, robberies, people stealing from each other.	probably
164309:21	well, actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor,	probably
164415:10	and society probably, too.	probably
164445:57	but, i, y-, y-, you might be able *-1 to, uh, stop people, you know,	might
164469:23	they could p-, probably do it again.	probably
164490:60	and they don't think that, uh, stop and think and say, well, maybe i shouldn't do this, uh, because, uh, i might get the gas chamber or something like that.	maybe
164490:98	and they don't think that, uh, stop and think and say, well, maybe i shouldn't do this, uh, because, uh, i might get the gas chamber or something like that.	might
164645:31	there's a lot of folks *ich*-2 *ich*-5, probably, that *t*-1 are in prison that, uh, that *t*-4 aren't really a danger to society, huh,	probably
164654:5	probably more of them then the other way around.	probably
164669:24	so i can assume that you probably watch the t v news.	probably
165004:35	and, uh, one of the things that *t*-1 probably would have been better if, is if the entire county had had, had just one school system.	probably
165043:12	and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is *t*-1. you know,	might
165112:74	and i think 0 the difference for me was that my parents were, you know, they were definitely, they were always there,	definitely
165149:13	and it was probably made *-1 in china by slaves.	probably
165168:11	it's probably a japanese *rnr*-1 or a burmese *rnr*-1 company owning and hiring people in the u s.	probably
165175:91	they were talking about cars, uh, the car issue just came out. and about how, yeah, you'd like *-1 to buy an american car maybe *t*-2	maybe
165226:17	may-, maybe they're getting better,	maybe
165227:5	maybe they're starting *-1 to get a clue.	maybe
165231:8	it probably won't start *-1 really showing up until ninety-four or so.	probably
165235:46	technology that *t*-1 comes in right now is, is probably not going *-2 to be imple-, implemented *-3 until, you know, quite a few years down the road.	probably
165253:14	or, uh, maybe i say, well, you know, you paid five hundred bucks for this program,	maybe
165315:29	they issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with floppy drive.	possibly
165381:7	or maybe it *exp*-1 was thirty dollars * to do it	maybe
165409:24	i'm, you might say 0 i'm, uh, uh, good back yard mechanic	might
165432:122	and then if you go and like, just about any point, any you know point in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil, the oil is you might say, uh, a white golden brown.	might
165482:16	and, uh, probably about four months ago the water pump decided *-1 to go out.	probably
165813:70	actually that's kind of the type of car that i, i'm thinking about 0 we might get *t*-1.	might
165891:56	and that's kind of, that's, that's probably one thing 0 i'd look at *t*-1.	probably
166030:35	and the majority of the incentive in * recycling bottles probably, * believe it or not, is just * to get the extra nickel at the, uh, the store and not, uh,	probably
166067:23	th-, there definitely has *-1 to be a motivation factor	definitely
166161:13	so there's maybe a five year gap between us.	maybe
166205:15	i think 0 maybe those people *ich*-4 that *t*-1 really do need *-2 to work, both parents, *-3 just to survive.	maybe
166239:50	and then, sometimes i, i often, uh, find that maybe there's so many different things available to us. yo-, a microwave, a v c r, a answering machine a, you know, a special, a dishwasher, uh, a refrigerator and some of those items, um, for the, for the, uh,	maybe
166286:10	and i certainly see how much *ich*-2 i pay *t*-1 in real estate taxes every year.	certainly
166372:163	i think that, that if, if there is a problem with the school system, uh, from, it *exp*-4's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well, uh, paid. that perhaps that might be one area that, that *t*-2 could be improved *-3.	might
166418:54	but, uh, i guess 0 if i have, uh, my druthers, i'd probably go for the seattle seahawks.	probably
166445:44	* to be honest with you, i, i probably watch, uh, college a little bit more than i do pro.	probably
166480:8	you probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then.	probably
166504:41	well, i can see, i can see definitely how you get into that *t*-1.	definitely
166617:30	there's an element there's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere.	definitely
166625:11	rugby is definitely big in college because it's something 0 a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do *t*-1.	definitely
166973:13	uh, i certainly can't argue with that.	certainly
167003:22	and i suppose 0 an elitist might say, well, you really want someone who *t*-1 is well educated *-2 to be able *-3 to, to winnow the facts from the, from the prejudice.	might
167090:37	well, if it's a second offense, the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense, because obviously, the rehabilitation process did not work the first time.	certainly
167120:28	de-, devil's advocate possibly,	possibly
167186:140	if, if i'm a computer consulting firm and i see these, this great deal on forty-six mother boards, uh, from, from say utah. um, i, i might buy the mother boards from utah but then still have *-1 to pay pennsylvania sales tax.	might
167243:76	oh, well, i guess, 0 if i, if it was someone in my family, i'd probably feel that way.	probably
167248:46	but, but i feel like if i did, i probably would feel that way.	probably
167280:38	and so, uh, the likelihood that, you know, maybe expected, expected murders by him is, is, uh, integrated *-1 over the income of the people, uh, that he murders *t*-3 is maybe, you know, a loss of, who *t*-4 knows, eight hundred thousand dollars.	maybe
167280:141	and so, uh, the likelihood that, you know, maybe expected, expected murders by him is, is, uh, integrated *-1 over the income of the people, uh, that he murders *t*-3 is maybe, you know, a loss of, who *t*-4 knows, eight hundred thousand dollars.	maybe
167308:50	of course, a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get *?*, i think 0 *t*-1, in terms of psychological impact.	possibly
167373:23	and it's preconstructed *-2 you might say 0 *t*-1.	might
167434:117	it was sort of just, you know, uh, * gets your, get his, you know, my bro-, my brother and well, maybe, you know, my cousin's coming over today *-1 to help us do that kind of thing. so that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic sometimes.	maybe
167464:30	it's sort of like a farm, you might say 0 *t*-1.	might
167631:37	we take, oh, one big vacation a year and then maybe, you know, three small vacations.	maybe
167872:78	i mean, in the, in those places where, uh, like the economy is really bad *t*-1, they might, you know, be more tempted *-2 to, to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the, you know, money *-3 to put food on the table and stuff like that. more than they would *?*, you know, in areas where they	might
167885:14	now i think maybe 0 it's started *-1 changing in the past few years because, uh, they have of these, uh, sort of mandatory, --tory tests if 0 you have *-2 to take *t*-3 before you get a diploma.	maybe
167889:33	but, uh, but, uh, certainly before that, there were people that, you know, *t*-1 would graduate from high school and could barely read.	certainly
167894:89	i, i, i mean i just can't even picture how that could happen. you know, except maybe to someone who *t*-1's, you know, really badly learning, uh, disabled or something *t*-2.	maybe
167918:46	and i think 0 that's almost a bigger factor, than anything else probably.	probably
167929:138	i think 0 it *exp*-2'd be interesting * to, you know, to spend a couple of days * just looking around an inner city school. uh, you know, sort, sort of maybe from elementary through, uh, high school. you know, just sort of * to get a feel for what it's like *t*-1.	maybe
168035:12	i think probably due to, uh, a lot of students going back and forth to school.	probably
168284:93	it's like well you know, if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink, you know, like a couple of twelve packs, maybe, over the weekend it's going *-1 to be hard pressed * to p-, *-1 to put all your recyclables in that one place, you know.	maybe
168296:12	that's definitely one thing 0 they could do *t*-1 *-2 to make it easier is * to just, you know.	definitely
168298:64	* have them do a little bit of the sorting. you know. and, and maybe come up with a better system.	maybe
168400:63	and, uh, our family income, at this point, is comfortable. upper middle class i guess 0 you might say 0 *t*-1.	might
168543:22	but, um, uh *, maybe slowly changing my opinion.	maybe
168557:23	she, she probably would agree more with you	probably
168577:8	i certainly don't, uh, advocate * turning people like that loose.	certainly
168626:12	the european countries certainly, uh, none of them have capital punishment	certainly
168643:8	you might be right.	might
168687:49	what what's *t*-1 making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of * punishing?	might
168721:27	that ki-, the kids maybe on the average get, uh, something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents.	maybe
168727:34	i don't quite understand it, although i think probably 0 the, the worst thing that *t*-1's happening in the world, at least the modern world today, is television.	probably
168867:13	oh, i probably spend an hour or two.	probably
169039:33	i, i think 0 that might be talking, referring to, uh, something, kind of, uh, alternative to the draft, you know.	might
169056:8	that probably is not what *t*-1 was comprehended *-2.	probably
169125:47	and it was, uh, you know, it was definitely a projection of u s power on the other side of the globe,	definitely
169459:74	if you were deeply involved in it, then you immediately realize that what they print *t*-1 is stuff that you probably knew *t*-5 already and the stuff that you want *t*-2 they're not printing *t*-4 because the average person doesn't need or want *-3 to know that much.	probably
169548:5	probably the best things 0 * to do *t*-1 is, is * tie them with a rope and throw them in the water	probably
169578:38	and i, i think 0 that's probably all right in that they, you know, maybe know what the, the norm *ich*-2 is *t*-1 for a particular thing.	probably
169578:67	and i, i think 0 that's probably all right in that they, you know, maybe know what the, the norm *ich*-2 is *t*-1 for a particular thing.	maybe
169588:30	possibly though on, uh, capital cases like maybe the death penalty	maybe
169598:7	but maybe, uh,	maybe
169681:8	well maybe not.	maybe
169716:26	that, that's probably an expensive trial.	probably
169730:11	it's probably like thirty, forty thousand dollars a day you know, worth of all the free for all.	probably
169898:50	you know, so as a patient, i feel 0 well, yeah, we probably should be protected *-1.	probably
169922:7	but maybe you shouldn't be held *-1 responsible for something 0 you did *t*-2 several years ago.	maybe
169945:10	so that probably wouldn't be too good either.	probably
169955:171	but if you had, if you had, uh, parents say or, or, or th-, grandparents, whatever it is *t*-1, uh, who *t*-2 were ready, who, who you thought 0 *t*-3 might benefit from a nursing home, what do you think 0 you would look for *t*-4?	might
170007:181	but again, um, it must be depressing for the people who, who *t*-1 are, who *t*-2 are just e-, e-, essentially not able *-3 to take care of themselves in their own house but, but, certainly, uh, certainly have ar-, ar-, are, have retained all of their, uh, mental skills and so on.	certainly
170007:194	but again, um, it must be depressing for the people who, who *t*-1 are, who *t*-2 are just e-, e-, essentially not able *-3 to take care of themselves in their own house but, but, certainly, uh, certainly have ar-, ar-, are, have retained all of their, uh, mental skills and so on.	certainly
170023:26	and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person's needs is really because this person is just, you know, is just in a state where they don't really need what they think 0 they need *t*-1 *t*-2, you know.	maybe
170052:17	there's nothing, maybe a picture or two that *t*-1 belongs to that person	maybe
170114:12	uh, so maybe we should start with you.	maybe
170186:8	i certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever.	certainly
170214:39	someday, if i were *-1 to get remarried *-2 i might want *-3 to buy a house which *t*-4 requires lots of money which i don't have *t*-5	might
170242:65	but for me, i only do that every week or, without even, i mean, maybe once a month.	maybe
170280:55	the area 0 i work in *t*-1, it, it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so.	maybe
170292:48	well, i, i work for, uh, *ich*-1 actually probably similar kind of place.	probably
170312:257	uh, while i was sitting here *-1 waiting while they tried *-2 to find somebody 0 for me to talk to *t*-3, *-1 trying *-8 to think of what, uh, uh, what things *ich*-5 *t*-4 were important, uh, besides salary and a, and a job. i guess, uh, mumblex list 0 i had scribbled *t*-6 down was the people 0 you worked with *t*-7 and maybe the, uh, the challenge of the work and, uh the working conditions, things like that.	maybe
170322:15	well those and probably the security aspect of it.	probably
170360:35	i don't see how one or two people, maybe more one or two, but, you know, a number of people can, can be the downfall of com-, a company situation *t*-1.	maybe
170517:7	and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that.	maybe
170519:31	you know, i think 0 that's probably true.	probably
170576:60	i think 0 a, a, more than one child, probably three children is probably the ideal to me	probably
170576:71	i think 0 a, a, more than one child, probably three children is probably the ideal to me	probably
170578:10	i most certainly couldn't educate three.	certainly
170761:17	uh, more than likely.	likely
170763:53	* apparently just, uh, re-, re-, uh, probably filled the, the brake fluid up	probably
170766:16	that was it, probably.	probably
170872:23	well a lot of it's probably *-1 to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help.	probably
170881:11	that's probably a large factor.	probably
170938:15	and you probably, if it were you, you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place 0 for you to live *t*-1 based on lowest price.	probably
170938:41	and you probably, if it were you, you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place 0 for you to live *t*-1 based on lowest price.	probably
170948:8	well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is * to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth * continuing *t*-1.	maybe
171007:85	i suppose, uh, 0 if you're, if there is a psychology department or an education department around, you might find you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another,	might
171007:97	i suppose, uh, 0 if you're, if there is a psychology department or an education department around, you might find you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another,	might
171247:11	you're probably right.	probably
171359:15	i think 0 maybe th-, a judge is a better judge of that	maybe
171367:5	maybe i'm too, too, uh, uh, conservative when it comes to that *t*-1.	maybe
171379:190	but people who *t*-4 d-, don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like *t*-1 and what the options are *t*-2, * to ask them *-3 to decide for one case, on one person, based on what they see *t*-5, i think 0 that is maybe, uh, a little bit naive.	maybe
171406:26	but, the thing is too, 0 maybe they need more of a, i don't know, more of a expert types to, to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick, you know, joe blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever an-, and call them in.	maybe
171483:32	but that's, that's probably the worst.	probably
171551:8	they might work on that, you know.	might
171586:32	and you know, no matter how crabby you might be *t*-1 over the phone, they are very understanding	might
171616:44	uh, and i only update that, oh i don't know, maybe once every quarter or so. every three months. just, basically when the statements come in *t*-1. you know. *-2 just to see whether or not we're falling, you know, getting ahead, falling behind or staying even or what.	maybe
171680:10	but they probably won't *?* because next week the kids have school vacation.	probably
171738:22	but at the present stage, you probably are even more *ich*-1 in the market for a, a budgetary thing than, than most people probably ar-, might be *?*. in terms of * keeping, keeping score of input and output.	probably
171738:95	but at the present stage, you probably are even more *ich*-1 in the market for a, a budgetary thing than, than most people probably ar-, might be *?*. in terms of * keeping, keeping score of input and output.	probably
171738:110	but at the present stage, you probably are even more *ich*-1 in the market for a, a budgetary thing than, than most people probably ar-, might be *?*. in terms of * keeping, keeping score of input and output.	might
171911:8	we might *?*.	might
171916:8	you probably know,	probably
172074:5	maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who *t*-1 come back again and again.	maybe
172094:33	and if they're judged *-1 guilty * would probably be in a better pri-, position 0 * to give an appropriate, uh, sentencing *t*-2.	probably
172179:149	but i think 0 most lawyers do a pretty good job of * making that evident to, to clients unless they feel 0 they can, you know, tweak a jury into per-, *-1 giving a different sentence or possibly, if it's a civil case, giving higher, uh, you know, awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the, the award.	possibly
172202:51	well, uh, in the case of, civil, uh, things, i think maybe the, the use of the jury is very, often to the lawyer's advantage	maybe
172210:45	i mean there are cases where they could be settled *-1, maybe out of court a little more efficiently *t*-2.	maybe
172296:70	and i have really resisted the impulse *-1 to get one for the home. uh, up until, i guess, maybe about a year and a half ago,	maybe
172374:21	emil is, probably pulls down a third a-, of all my time.	probably
172490:52	but, uh, i'm afraid 0 i'm, i'm probably in the minority.	probably
172534:74	well and i still think that, * having lived in europe for awhile, you know, difference in living conditions are certainly well worth, uh, what we pay *t*-1 for it.	certainly
172557:10	uh, probably m-, less so *ich*-1 now than it was *?* ten years ago or whatever	probably
172584:26	that, that's probably a little tougher on you.	probably
172651:56	* belonging to a group is the, * belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection 0 you can have *t*-1 after you,	probably
172682:7	or maybe they don't.	maybe
172861:14	and, uh, probably a good woman,	probably
172945:95	at thirty-three hundred dollars or thirty-five hundred dollars 0 i'm paying *t*-1 in taxes, why i, i could go down to bulverde and probably rent a, rent a house for that, right?	probably
172962:20	but, uh, there's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer *t*-1.	certainly
172996:20	so. well, it's certainly, uh, uh,	certainly
173088:8	we might go again on a, on a van.	might
173089:26	we, we could probably do with a, a, something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time.	probably
173105:32	and, uh, th-, it certainly had that.	certainly
173225:56	i, i mean, the only thing 0 i think 0 i might get *t*-1, a new car or, not necessarily a new car but, a, another car,	might
173336:46	uh, i was told *-1 by her preschool teacher that she thought 0 maybe she was to immature for kindergarten	maybe
173364:30	i, we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now.	maybe
173585:47	i think 0 capital punishment, uh, uh, was or probably stringent enough	probably
173590:115	do, do you feel as though there should be, uh, more, uh, was or, or more, uh, you might say transgressions that *t*-1 would be enforceable by, uh, by, uh, uh, capital punishment?	might
173600:99	uh, the laws exist and mumblex are frequently upheld *-3 in, in, uh, in appeals court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find *t*-2.	maybe
173671:137	of course, if he's fallen in love with drugs and there isn't anything but * getting stoned or high is, is the only thing in life that *t*-1 seems *-2 to be meaningful, then maybe there is no hope.	maybe
173677:55	uh, well i guess 0 i, i guess 0 i'm probably a little more to, toward the other direction.	probably
173707:18	i mean, prohibition certainly didn't last.	certainly
173744:228	but i, i, i, i think that, that the, that, you know, the, *-1 being in law enforcement, you know, th-, th-, th-, they, i, i probably have a kind of a draconian, philistine attitude toward it.	probably
174157:36	and, you know, the younger kids, uh, or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another.	maybe
174201:11	well i definitely think, like 0 decisions have *-1 to be unanimous.	definitely
174205:21	i think 0 that's probably a good thing.	probably
174207:11	it's probably the safest thing.	probably
174233:4	definitely	definitely
174397:42	but, uh, that friend of mine's telling me that i might have *-1 to go in for, uh, as a witness.	might
174502:138	if some, if it *exp*-1 were possible * to market some, uh, form of, uh, space technology, you know, * to, uh, uh, to make it equitable, it might severely help the economy, you know, in the, in the, uh, respect that, you know, there's endless amounts of research 0 *t*-2 to be done *-3. endless amounts of resources and and whatnot,	might
174566:17	but the same money could probably be far better spent on, uh, uh, lunar bases and solar power satellite research and, you know, so forth.	probably
174621:34	well, i think 0 first degree murder, uh, probably warrants it.	probably
174718:118	and you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system, you know. because they figure well, you know, sure i, i get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something.	maybe
174720:52	if i, if i elicit good behavior i'm out in maybe five or ten.	maybe
174743:5	maybe mumblex,	maybe
174889:126	and i guess 0 the only drawback *ich*-2 0 i can see *t*-1 to, to drug testing is in, 0 in case you are on some sort of medication that *t*-3 might give some, uh, sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem.	might
174899:25	and that, that definitely happens, you know.	definitely
174964:8	you probably wondered, huh.	probably
174974:8	they probably give you a chance *-1 to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance *-2 to go through it.	probably
174974:41	they probably give you a chance *-1 to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance *-2 to go through it.	maybe
175030:53	and, uh, you know, that's the kind of thing that *t*-1 would definitely come up, you know.	definitely
175036:36	is it *exp*-1 formal policy that they said 0 they might test?	might
175144:13	and that's certainly is a lot of students 0 for one person to deal with *t*-1 on an every day basis.	certainly
175224:38	uh, we had a school that *t*-1 had classes probably about the same size 0 you're talking *t*-2, twenty-seven, thirty kids to sc-, to a class.	probably
175386:43	i'm, i'm sure 0 you've probably heard of marion berry.	probably
175414:36	the, appeal procedure is the only thing 0 i can possibly think of *t*-1.	possibly
175476:7	and maybe that's, that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world 0 * to, to do *t*-1.	maybe
175476:35	and maybe that's, that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world 0 * to, to do *t*-1.	probably
175545:66	and, you know, if you don't really count. if you're not part of the program you might not get told *-1 for months.	might
175546:10	or you might *?*, you know, if it doesn't impact you directly. or if your management doesn't think that.	might
175677:5	maybe it was in miami.	maybe
175723:8	she probably won't be ab-, able *-1 to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle.	probably
175738:54	and, uh, but on the whole i think 0 it, uh, probably was the wrong thing 0 * to do *t*-1.	probably
175791:16	uh, they're certainly all leaders	certainly
175801:58	* looking back, it seems like that was only partly true. that, uh, there might have been a better place 0 * to draw the line *t*-1.	might
175815:37	and as you say, uh, * going halfway was probably worse than, uh, * committing, uh, committing to a completely and, uh, winning it, whatever that would mean *t*-1.	probably
175850:21	like i was thinking that maybe the most important effect 0 it had *t*-1 was * to make it *exp*-2, uh, possible and even popular * to, uh, criticize the government.	maybe
175852:42	that pendulum started *-1 to swing, uh, ma-, maybe even too far. to the point where, uh, uh, * supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the vietnam war on *t*-2.	maybe
176056:8	it certainly is *?*.	certainly
176170:33	i mean, uh, i say 0 it might go for another thirteen	might
176350:30	you know, the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since mumblex.	maybe
176380:59	uh, so your, you, i guess 0 you're probably in the same, uh, same situation 0 uh, we're in *t*-1.	probably
176540:13	and he'll probably just sleep anyway.	probably
176669:30	it, it, uh, certainly has no life threatening, uh, capabilities uh, you know, in, in my job.	certainly
176675:77	i, i agree that there are, there are, uh, jobs that *t*-1 are definitely life threatening	definitely
176733:9	about maybe, oh, close to a year ago now i guess, i, i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house.	maybe
176964:11	it's probably more there.	probably
176967:8	it probably comes from where you are *t*-1.	probably
176971:21	that it probably does.	probably
177004:13	so that's probably about what you're paying *t*-1	probably
177037:8	well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that	maybe
177077:10	and you might even be able *-1 to, to use it for, for a bombing test site, you know.	might
177255:17	and i think 0 probably it's pretty important right there.	probably
177302:17	i think, 0 probably your, a great deal of what you say *t*-1 is true about the legals.	probably
177341:41	of course, uh, you being from new mexico, you've probably been n-, to washington. especially if you're, your present location.	probably
177401:14	well that's certainly, uh, you know, uh, getting into the swim of things.	certainly
177421:46	uh, and, uh, and * limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than * limiting the weight.	probably
177423:82	well, of course, that, uh, you know, those big trucks can, can, probably are far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor.	probably
177485:94	i'm not, it's not something 0 i really enjoy *t*-1 all that much that, i'll, i'll probably,	probably
177656:58	i, i do do things, uh, that *t*-2 might be too crude 0 *t*-3 to be called *-1 woodworking.	might
177665:15	and, uh i definitely have begun *-1 to accumulate tools too.	definitely
177693:27	and now i use it twice a year maybe.	maybe
177740:56	so the price of a good set of, uh, carbide steel, uh, bits is probably, uh, i mean, a, a good set of bits is probably going *-1 to run you a hundred dollars	probably
177740:111	so the price of a good set of, uh, carbide steel, uh, bits is probably, uh, i mean, a, a good set of bits is probably going *-1 to run you a hundred dollars	probably
