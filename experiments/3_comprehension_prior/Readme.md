# Prior elicitation experiment

We have two conditions (probably-biased and might-biased) with a male and female speaker.

## Participants

MTurk participants with US IP addresses and >95% approval. For each condition, we run 40 participants. Within each condition, 20 participants see the male speaker and 20 participants see the female speaker.


## Exclusion criteria

We exclude participants who provide the wrong answer to more than 25% of the catch trials (i.e., participants who provide the correct answer to less than 12/15 catch trials.)

## Exclusion criteria

We exclude participants who provide the wrong answer to more than 2 of the 5 catch trials.
