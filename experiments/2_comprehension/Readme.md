# Adaptation experiment

We have two conditions (probably-biased and might-biased) with a male and female speaker.

## Participants

MTurk participants with US IP addresses and >95% approval. For each condition, we run 40 participants. Within each condition, 20 participants see the male speaker and 20 participants see the female speaker.


## Exclusion criteria

We exclude participants who provide the wrong answer to more than 25% of the catch trials (i.e., participants who provide the correct answer to less than 12/15 catch trials.)

## Procedure

See the following web-based experiments: 

- Probably-biased condition, female speaker:
  https://nlp.stanford.edu/~sebschu/experiments/adaptation/1_adaptation/experiment-cond-0.html
- Might-biased condition, female speaker:
  https://nlp.stanford.edu/~sebschu/experiments/adaptation/1_adaptation/experiment-cond-1.html
- Probably-biased condition, male speaker:
  https://nlp.stanford.edu/~sebschu/experiments/adaptation/1_adaptation/experiment-cond-2.html
- Might-biased condition, male speaker:
  https://nlp.stanford.edu/~sebschu/experiments/adaptation/1_adaptation/experiment-cond-3.html

## Predictions

We predict that the difference in AUC between the might ratings and the probably ratings will be significantly higher in the might-biased condition than in the probably-based condition.
